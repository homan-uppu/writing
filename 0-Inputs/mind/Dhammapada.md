**189.** **Such, indeed, is no safe refuge**; such is not the refuge supreme. Not by resorting to such a refuge is one released from all suffering.

**185.** Not despising, not harming, restraint according to the code of monastic discipline, moderation in food, dwelling in solitude, devotion to meditation — this is the teaching of the Buddhas.

**186-187.** There is no satisfying sensual desires, even with the rain of gold coins. For sensual pleasures give little satisfaction and much pain. Having understood this, the wise man finds no delight even in heavenly pleasures. The disciple of the Supreme Buddha delights in the destruction of craving.

**277.** **"All conditioned things are impermanent" — when one sees this with wisdom, one turns away from suffering. This is the path to purification.**

**278.** "All conditioned things are unsatisfactory" — when one sees this with wisdom, one turns away from suffering. This is the path to purification.

**280.** The idler who does not exert himself when he should, who though young and strong is full of sloth, with a mind full of vain thoughts — such an indolent man does not find the path to wisdom.

**282.** Wisdom springs from meditation; without meditation wisdom wanes. Having known these two paths of progress and decline, let a man so conduct himself that his wisdom may increase.
-> stagnancy is an illusion. There is only progress / decline.

**283.** Cut down the forest (craving), but not the tree; from the forest springs fear. Having cut down the forest and the underbrush, be passionless, O monks!

**287.** As a great flood carries away a sleeping village, so death seizes and carries away the man with a clinging mind, doting on his children and cattle.

**288 - 89.** For him who is assailed by death there is no protection by kinsmen. None there are to save him — no sons, nor father, nor relatives. Realizing this fact, let the wise man, restrained by morality, hasten to clear the path leading to Nibbana.

**311.** Just as _kusa_ grass wrongly handled cuts the hand, even so, a recluse's life wrongly lived drags one to states of woe.
- This is important. Solitude hurts more than it helps if you don't know how to approach it in the right way.

**313.** If anything is to be done, let one do it with sustained vigor. A lax monastic life stirs up the dust of passions all the more.
- Intensity matters. There is no room to slack off in any endeavor.

**317.** Those who see something to fear where there is nothing to fear, and see nothing to fear where there is something to fear — upholding false views, they go to states of woe.
- The problem isn't fear! It's fearing the wrong things, to the wrong degree. There is skill in how you fear.

**342.** Beset by craving, people run about like an entrapped hare. Held fast by mental fetters, they come to suffering again and again for a long time.

**97.** The man who is without blind faith, who knows the Uncreated, who has severed all links, destroyed all causes (for karma, good and evil), and thrown out all desires — he, truly, is the most excellent of men. [[11]](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/dhp/dhp.intro.budd.html#fn-11)

**98.** Inspiring, indeed, is that place where Arahants dwell, be it a village, a forest, a vale, or a hill. Inspiring are the forests in which worldlings find no pleasure. There the passionless will rejoice, for they seek no sensual pleasures.
- Go to such inspiring places to practice. Allow the inspiration to push you.

**204.** Health is the most precious gain and contentment the greatest wealth. A trustworthy person is the best kinsman, Nibbana the highest bliss.

**205.** Having savored the taste of solitude and peace (of Nibbana), pain-free and stainless he becomes, drinking deep the taste of the bliss of the Truth.
