I don't think fear itself is a problem. What matters is what you're afraid of. If you're afraid of not becoming successful, that's a problem. However, if you're afraid of not learning the truth, that's actually a good problem to have. Whatever you're afraid of is what you're going to make sure doesn't happen.

If you're afraid of losing or not becoming successful, you'll go down the path of hard work and struggle. If you're afraid of not learning the absolute truth and not realizing your full potential, you'll go down the path of mastery. The nature of your fear has consequences.

I don't measure progress in the traditional sense. I just measure whether you got to where you want to go or not. It's not about goals; it's about what you believe yourself to be, what you believe your destiny is, what you believe to be your birthright, who you feel you were born to be.

Committees are driven by group dynamics, and whenever you have more than one person in any situation, it's going to be diluted. That's why boards often don't know anything substantial. They might know what they want, but there isn't a single group in the world that has true wisdom. Even in a Buddhist monastery, the group doesn't have wisdom. There might be one individual who has wisdom, and it probably isn't even the leader.

**Groups are a dumbing-down phenomenon, a regression to the mean**. The only effectiveness coming out of a group is in situations where sheer numbers are needed, like lifting a heavy log. That's fine for physical tasks. But for anything on an intellectual level or non-mechanical, groups will always be filled with mediocre people. If there's one brilliant person in that group, they will either be stifled by the mediocrity or leave.
