1. Build.
2. Research a plan for posture.

I think tomorrow (Wed, Feb 21) is going to be the day for the full end-to-end testing.

That would be 8 days since embarking on building this. That’s absolutely fascinating if you ask me. This is possibly the quickest I’ve built something of this quality.

I'm excited for how I can use this muscle. Because with the added patience and design chops, I can literally create anything. My imagination is my only constraint.

I'm going to quite caffeine from tomorrow onwards. I don't want to give any external substance a chance to manipulate my self - during this sensitive phase. Absolutely.

And I need to dig deeper into the path. It requires quite a bit of training to develop reasonable mastery over the mind.

Every experience in which the mind rules over me is a nudge to invest even more deeply into the Dhamma - to dig deep and gain mastery over the most important tool in the world.

But have no anxiety or fear my friend. You are on the path. You are bound to reach the destination. One step at a time. One decade at a time. You know what to prioritize. Amen.

Become a master over your own mind. Amen.

These first couple of years is about preparation: to get the body and mind ready for this deeper journey, as you also build your standing in the material world. Amen.

Only plan the path, let everything else fall into place naturally. Take things by the day. Give things the space to evolve naturally. Amen. Focus on the moment.
