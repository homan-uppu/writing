1. Write the plan. You have received the vision, you just have to capture it, and execute it. (This includes how you're going to execute this early stage: i.e. how you're going to share your work). (This can take as long as it needs to take. No need to rush this. It's more important to get all your thoughts out there first, before jumping into anything).
2. Pre-production work: design.
3. SwiftUI foundation.
4. Build.

Sitting at 4am instead of 5am is better. There is a kind of silence that I didn't think was possible in this location. Incredible.

I'm still getting used to the 3 hours. It's rough when I'm sleepy (which I was today for, honestly, the majority of it).

Always be aware of sensations. Be grounded in reality so that you know when emotion is rising and you can intentionally let it go. The unbinding. (Unbinding, inc. - the name of the company for this direction).

Be grounded in sensations.
Add a session during the day.

Anicca. Nothing lasts. This too shall pass.

The war continues. Must exercise moment to moment awareness. Don't let the mind slip. Put it only where you want it to be.
