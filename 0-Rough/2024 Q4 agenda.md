### On momentum
The most important thing for me right now is building momentum. I have absolutely no momentum at the moment and it's a disgusting feeling. Absolutely disgusting feeling. I literally have nothing.
What exactly do I mean by **momentum**? See what that state looks like:
- I have a team of folks who can validate directions, set up conversations, and allow me to **delegate** every single task that is not my core competency. I don't ever want to do anything that is not a top strength of mine. Ever.
- The **capital** to travel the world and engage with the best in their crafts. The top artists, entrepreneurs, athletes, etc. Have the capital to be able to collaborate with the best of the best.
- The mental freedom that stems from knowing that all base requirements are taken care of for the foreseeable future - for myself, my family, and close friends.
### Goals for 2025
1. Achieve momentum. Earn the freedom to really experiment. Take your position to the next level.
### Doubling down on strengths
- Generating ideas.
- Product taste / judgement / quality.
- Ability to sell.
I don't want to be sitting around for months building something before shipping. Fuck that Indie hacker nonsense bullshit. That approach does not play to your strengths. Build the team that can complement you. Play the aggressive sales game. Your advantage is that you can better hire for product and engineering than the traditional person who can sell. You can find the right talent to complement your skills like few others. Take advantage of that.
### Angles with clear initial momentum.
- **Lawyer copilot** targeting 20 - 30 year old, up and coming Indian lawyers (i.e. the current generation of the profession that's significantly more open to leveraging technology).
	- Family and friends network in India itself should be a ripe enough starting point to get the ball rolling - at least 50 warm intros to the target audience that I can set up right away. - You've **underestimated your network** here in India. Take advantage of that.
- **Communication feedback for engineers** - this revenue for this is a bit more precarious because the value proposition is less straightforward (I mean, the problem definitely exists, but the pricing can't be aggressive because the value of good communication isn't objectively clear in the way that the value for a lawyer copilot can be gauged).
- **Information consumption copilot** - but there is really no revenue angle for this up front, but there could be a significant upside to that risk eventually - because the underlying technology is powerful (i.e. the ability to attach an LLM to the browser). - consider this.
