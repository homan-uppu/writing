**Write**. Jump back into the writing quickly. Focus on curbing distraction today better than before. I still have a lot of room for improvement to keep the mind where I want it to be.

That's it. There's really nothing else that I'd want to do. Just write.

Today is going to be a special day because I'm going to extend writing until late into eve (until it's time to sleep - so around 9pm). I'm going to have food at the office itself and bring everything back home with me at the end of the day. Amen.

I'm also convinced to write in Obsidian. I think this is the best tool that exists to transform thinking into clarity. That's what's required.
