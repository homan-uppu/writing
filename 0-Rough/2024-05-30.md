There is great work to be done. I just have to re-calibrate the mind and attack it again.

I need to slow down, but have greater focus. The combination is required. My mind is racing too fast these past couple of days. I can feel the impatience to just ship something. That's the kind of attitude that will poison your efforts.

Learn to take the time to ship great work. Don't lower your bar. And take more time than you think so that you can flesh it out well.

And there are absolutely no commitments here. My mind is starting to commit to the path of creating the "Investing in people" platform that makes sense to me. But don't commit to it! In fact, operate as if someone else is going to build it and it's my job to just shed light on what it is. That's all. Be dispassionate. Don't be attached to the idea that YOU are the one that needs to implement it. You definitely don't have to be the one. You don't "need" to do anything. That's the crux.

It's time for war. Prepare the concentration of the mind. Lean into the challenge. Go hard, but smoothly.
