On collaboration: this is absolutely required. There is no way to do great work without the right collaborators. Amen. Take an honest sabbatical with the arts. Write fleshed out scripts for short films. And just keep at it. There is no way around it. You will perpetually be in a limbo until and unless you make an honest attempt.

And this is the right age. You have a rich life experience you can draw on. You understand your feelings better. These are what will enable you to create.

It boils down to telling a good story. And in order to do that, you need to have a great understanding of the human condition.
