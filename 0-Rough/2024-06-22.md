No more content consumption. It's honestly killing ability to be original and create.
Focus on the business you're going to create and why. And then double down on it aggressively.

You need to work on the mind. The mind is getting too stuck on others. Turn your attention within. Deepen your practice. Maintain a strong, balanced mind in the face of anything. No matter how much of a "failure" you feel like. No matter how worthless you may feel in the moment. Train the mind to let the feeling pass and get back to work. That's all you can do. That's all you must do. Amen.

Sit the course if you need to. Don't operate on craving.

Gather some writing inspiration. Get ready for your evening sit.
