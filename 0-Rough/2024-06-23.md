Tomorrow:
- Start day with a 3 hour sit. (Time to ramp this up again).
- Absolutely no calorie consumption until around 6pm.
- I want a solid day of writing. Explore and craft the angle for seeking truth is the only skill. As I thought of earlier: it is the most fundamental skill. There are many ways to analyze and approach this. find the right ones and dig deep. This is going to be the start of a beautiful journey. Amen.

Great. Office space set up really well. Just focus and grind.

Calm down. You don't want to randomly jump into things willy nilly. You must think it through. Be methodical. And most importantly, be sufficiently balanced.

Chores for tomorrow:
1. Get 2 new glasses.
2. Set up budgeting. It's time to bunker down.
