Today is primarily going to be writing and designing.

[[MAIN]] - focus on the pipeline here. It forces me to establish the vision of what I'm going for with this opinionated AI (and why that is so important).

Then craft a **solid product document**: the script for what you're going to build. The problem statement with sufficient precision, and brainstorming approaches to tackling it. The starting phase will almost certainly be a "do things that don't scale" approach. But the efforts must be well directed.

Have an aggressive timeline. I'd like to ship something by the end of July. That seems like a reasonable goal. Get the essays out first. Have a reasonably clear vision of what you're aiming for before you go all guns blazing.

Just *create value*, and see what comes from that. Amen. In the worst case it's a glorified bookmarks repository. I'll take that! Lol.
