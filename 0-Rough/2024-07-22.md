Sit & write. That is all there is to be done. Amen. You've consumed so much information in life already. It's time to be putting it out there.

Should I be diving deep into the consumption tool first? I think so. I think that is the starting point. I desperately need to clean up my consumption before I do anything else. It's critically bad. Need to radically improve it.

But. I'm not confident this is a requirement for right now. I think a better use of my time is to just focus on writing.

But, do this: save worthwhile content locally (ideally within the obsidian vault itself), and take notes within Obsidian. Stick to this. Don't get sucked into the world of building when your focus needs to be writing. Amen.

Wise decision. Save the building for the right thing. When you have the necessary emotional activation energy to see it through. Amen. If the idea keeps bothering you, then you know it has legs on it. Amen.

Save the idea for later. When you have free time, spend it designing what this would look & feel like.
