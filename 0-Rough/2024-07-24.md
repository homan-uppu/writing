Eve agenda: nothing. Just get the party started. That's all you need to do. Nothing else matters at the moment. You're gone for 30 days. Don't overthink it. Just make it happen.

And delete absolutely everythin. Amen.

Today is all about designing the self course that will start this evening. And build up the emotional activation energy to carry it out. And take care of any chores you may have.
