1. Define this 41 day phase (and yes, you're going to be right here).
2. Back to writing. Just keep writing.

### Thoughts
- Going to go to Srisailam tomorrow to check it out. See if there's a spot there that can be conducive to a deeper dive and start a practice there.
- Be patient. This is a long journey. You can't shortcut yourself to anything worthwhile. You need a deep lifestyle shift. Towards the lifestyle that produces the results that you want. That is what is required. Amen. Lifestyle slowly builds the right mind. The right mind slowly creates the right things.
- Damn, I'm getting a "what the hell are you doing" feeling in my body. LOL.
- Don't turn on the internet! Just use the computer to write. That is it. Discipline how you use technology.

I also need to have the capacity to be more long-term oriented. That's critical for doing great work.
