1. Understand the situation of my mind and how I'm going to get better at working with it.
2. Read PG's essay on what makes a good essay. Take notes.
3. A from the top draft of the essay, PG style, without worrying about the outline, or anything for that matter. Simply writing it as I would want it to be read to me. Amen.

The mind is incredibly difficult to work with.
The path to progress truly is as narrow as a razor's edge. Seriously. I don't think I've quite appreciated this statement, but the more I attempt to walk the path, the more clear it becomes.

"Rise, awake!  
Having obtained these boons, understand them!  
Like the Razor's sharp edge is difficult to traverse,  
The path to one's Self is difficult." 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katha_Upanishad).

The masters of the mind have clearly seen through all of the nonsense a mind throws at you.

“O Krishna, the mind is very restless, turbulent, strong and obstinate. It appears to me that it is more difficult to control than the wind.” - this is so, so true. But to try and wield it is the only path.
