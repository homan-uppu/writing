1. Let's get through the writing. Condensing it is required.

To me, this writing is the foundation for everything that I'm going to do. Nothing else is more important at the moment. I must get through this. Amen.

The mind has become difficult to work with. Focus on the diet and everything should take care of itself.

The diet must be strict. Yesterday was a mistake. You absolutely must eat less than you think you need. In fact, read what the Buddha has to say about this (the discourse on eating). The food is what is pulling the body, and therefore the mind, down. Recognize it.

"Eating once, and just the right amount makes all your afflictions more slender." - slender is the perfect word to describe what happens.

"I abstain from the night-time meal.[[1]](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.070.than.html#fn-1)Â As I am abstaining from the night-time meal, I sense next-to-no illness, next-to-no affliction, lightness, strength, & a comfortable abiding. Come now. You too abstain from the night-time meal. As you are abstaining from the night-time meal, you, too, will sense next-to-no illness, next-to-no affliction, lightness, strength, & a comfortable abiding."

I'll eventually switch to eating in the late morning (11am), and nothing outside of that. I'll switch Yoga to the mornings right after the sit. Amen. Perfect.
