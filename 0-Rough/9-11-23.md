1. **Get a solid draft of the essay ready**. I must knock this out today.
2. **Website - get it to its final form**. Presentation is just as important as the content.
3. **Growth is more than half the battle**: e.g. Oppenheimer marketing budget as large as the movie budget itself! Use the same strategy.
	1. Start thinking about how you're going to grow it.

Spend some time thinking about the refinement. The iteration of the writing. Powerful. That's where 99% of the writing is at. Driving greater clarity. Amen.
