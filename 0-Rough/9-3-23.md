1. **Knock out today's post**. Give it a solid image to go along with it (first day might take a while to get the image right, but you can start to streamline the process over time). Start to develop a sort of visual and literary style in these posts.
2. **Today is project day**. It's time to really lean into the project - design it, spend time on it, and figure it out. Absolutely.

Next sesh:
- Do a solid writing session. You need to get it in, you're running out of time.

- **Sticking to OMAD is super important**. I'm going to be very strict about this from today onwards.
- **And protect Sila at all costs**. Don't break it in any conscious way. Double down on the practice. Continue to strengthen the mind. Amen.
- **Deep Ashtanga practice this evening**. And hop on the call for the session. Spend 20 mins beforehand looking at the series so that you can communicate which posture you left off at w/ Gururaja.

This path is as narrow as a razor's edge. It requires a constant push, struggle. It requires abstaining from most of the things that give you pleasure. This is the path. Master it.

You also have to abstain from nonsense content consumption. I don't think you quite realize how poisonous that can be...

Master the art of language. Amen.
