I think the most valuable product I can produce now is to show the path to a much better education system. Set the right incentives for the right training.

Invest money in individuals that want to "drop out". But the returns would take so long to arrive - much longer than if you were building a company, no?

This is your mind trying to find shortcuts. That's all that's happening right now. You need to see through this discomfort. Your mind is trying to find shortcuts because it is not content in the present moment. That is the problem you have right now.

The product is literally the system that transforms education in our world through having the right incentives.
