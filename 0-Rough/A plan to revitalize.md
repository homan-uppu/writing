*How long will it take to sufficiently reprogram the mind?*

90 days is a reasonable starting point.

*What would you do during that phase?*

- Completely disconnect from the internet. Treat it like a "rehab". Complete dopamine detox. Engage with the real world. Journey inwards. Live like an ancient. Go on walks.
- One normal meal a day. Fast for the majority of the day.
- Ashtanga Yogasanas.
- Slowly ramp up number of meditation hours.
- Be in the midst of nature.

The crux of the recovery is a strict dopamine fast, coupled with strong meditation sessions. I mean, the path has always been clear. It's about actually doing it. That's all that it takes. It's an inner choice. That's all it is. You can't keep seeking it outside of yourself. That's not going to help.

So why not a complete dopamine detox? Start at home. There's no need to travel someplace in order to lay the initial foundation.

What are some alternatives?
- Uttarkashi
- Srisailam

How about this. A 30 day complete dopamine detox (no consumption whatsoever), no technology, and the only things you will do is meditate and write (pen and paper). This is far more do-able than jumping into a longer meditation retreat (which you're not yet ready for).

These are the kinds of phases you need before you can take deeper plunges... let's make that clear first. A complete disconnection from the outside world while managing the mind well is the absolute first step.

Overcome your mind.

So, let's start this. Till Sept 1, I'm going to not touch any technology and go completely analog. No information consumption whatsoever. Just meditate & create (paper & pen). That's all you need to do. Done.

Run this experiment for a week and see how it goes?
