*Why Mokila is the perfect place to execute this phase*:
1. Every single thing outside of grinding is taken care of for me. Food, laundry, cleaning, etc. I have great ventilation in my room - and access to the terrace straight from my room in case I need to get some fresh air. This is game changing - I didn't have such an openness in the old flat which prevented me from executing stay-in-room phases because the lack of ventilation would kill me.

*Constraints:*
1. Noble silence. No talking with anyone - especially about things not related to work.
2. No frivolous content consumption (No video consumption whatsoever).
3. Strict one meal a day. No more caffeine consumption in the morning (start this after a couple of weeks). Fill your water buckets in the morning / night - enough to last you a day.
4. Sadhana:
	1. 4 hours of meditation every single day (minimum). Eventually ramp this up to 6 hours a day - you're going to need it.
	2. Ashtanga yogasanas in the morning / evening (just before the meal). Experiment with it, but it's definitely time to get back into it.
	3. Strict one meal a day diet. Don't even fill your stomach during that meal.
	4. Some weight training (with the kettlebell).

*Goals*:
1. 500k in the bank (after clearing 10k debt), in the direction of [[AI scales intuition]].

*Expected timeline*: by the end of the year. You have half a year to make this happen. Absolutely. Solid.

*Tasks to complete before starting this phase*:
1. Move out of DD colony completely.
2. Arrange office space well. Two desks. Lamp. See if you need anything else before getting started. I don't think you do.
3. Blazing fast internet connected through ethernet.

I'm going to do a trial run this week first to validate how productive this phase can be. Then, this Sunday I'm going to go move everything out of DD colony. Completely. And say bye to Thatha for the time being.
