From tomorrow onwards, I'm going to get in 3 sits: 1 hour each; no cutting a sit short anymore. You need the entire sit, and then some.

----

You've made your morning sit mechanical. You need to break out of that.

The sit this evening taught me the value of, and importance of actually sitting.

There's a huge difference here man.

Just like any creative skill, actually sitting is an order of magnitude more impactful than just sitting.

The only way to build your fortitude in order to thrive is to actually sit.

From now on, for every sit, actually sit. Amen.
