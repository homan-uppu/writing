Allow the disturbance to pass. Let it pass. You can't force it out of your system. The only way to let it pass is to not react to it. To simply watch the sensations come and go without getting entangled in it.

Train this skill. This itself is the practice. This itself is the Sadhana. As you allow each disturbance to pass on its own without getting entangled in it, the mind will settle into a deeper Samadhi.

And the process just keeps going on. This is really all there is to it. Keep at it.
