Everywhere I look people just put others down. Especially those that try to do something different. Those that are ambitious. It's kind of sad. It really is.

There needs to be a sort of "Sangha" for the ambitious. And even the havens of ambition in the past (e.g. "YC") are no longer ambitious because they aren't helmed by the ambitious. Sam / PG running YC is very different from the crew at YC right now.

This is quite unfortunate.

I feel bad for the countless folks in the world that are pulled down by this negativity. It's crazy.

I'm feeling down. Everywhere I look I see ideas that I believe are based on not thinking things through. Of course I could be deluded in my current ideas, but my sadness comes from seeing that what I see are delusions in the world are all delusions that I have once held. As I took the time to study the world, I believe my understanding of it has improved, and I feel bad that my previous delusions are still so damn prevalent in the world.

I need to find my Sangha. I absolutely do. Not necessarily those that believe everything I'm saying, but those who are ambitious and want to change the world. I absolutely need to find these people. I'm desperate to find them.

Friendship on the path is everything. Find those friends. Absolutely.
