I want to create something without thinking about users, monetization, or anything.
I just want to create something beautiful.
That serves a clearly defined purpose.
With no expectation that it will become something bigger.
With no pressure that it needs to "become my life's work" or some prescriptive, preconceived notion like that.
I just want to make something absolutely beautiful. Just for the sake of making it.
A "tiny" product.

Something focused on creation, not consumption.
A tool to lose yourself in?

A friend?
A friend for those who want someone to explore ideas with. To flesh out thinking. To just chat with. A friend who doesn't judge. Who nudges you to be better.

---

Design, develop, market this in absolute complete isolation. Don't think about, or look at, what the world has. Just create something beautiful from the heart. A pure form of self-expression. From the heart.

---

Drop any and all preconceived notions about what you are, or what you will become. Surrender to the Truth. Surrender to the process.

There is something special in trying to create a friend.
What could a friend be?
A friend has a story to tell. They aren't just mechanical consumers of information.
A friend looks a certain way. How they look changes over time.
A friend does things outside of your relationship. They have a life of their own.
