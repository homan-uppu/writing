1. There is a **profound possibility** to level up my life by going on a meditation + writing retreat someplace remote. That could be miraculous on my life. I have to earn the opportunity to do so.
2. Meditate. Ashtanga Yoga. One small meal per day. And write. Talk to no one. Only talk through your writing. This is all you need. Powerful. You can get this started right here, right now.
