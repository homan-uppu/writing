### Decisions
1. This will need to be a product that I use extensively. Like, all the fucking time.
2. Still need to decide on the **level of ambition**. Perhaps let that naturally arise? We'll find out.
### Process
Think of this as a series of experiments. **Design, validate, build, ship, iterate**. Put a lot more emphasis on the first step: design.

That's going to be quite important to think through. In fact, I'd urge you to validate multiple ideas at the design stage itself. Deep design. Don't move from Figma to code until you're really fucking certain. That's the fucking crux. Remember Ivan's design journey? That shit is absolutely necessary. Seriously.

OK, I'm convinced about this approach. It's time to execute hard on this. Absolutely. Let's get it. Amen.

Alright, today is the day. Pick the mountain and do a deep design sesh. Build the muscle to craft angles and designs quickly. At will. Let's go.
