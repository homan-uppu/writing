When to outreach, when to publish?

I'm leaning towards outreach when I have clarity on what the next steps are. I want to reach out when I have something to implement? That's the wrong strategy. Yes, I agree that outreach will be powerful and will happen then, but I also need to reach out now.

What is the "pitch" for the outreach. Just a share an essay that I wrote that you may find interesting. That is all that is required for now. Are you sure? Need to think this through with a calmer mind. There is something I'm missing here. Perhaps it's in the presentation. Maybe.

I'm also leaning towards shipping this and then really focusing on the essay on "How to educate yourself".

The mind has to settle. It is too rattled right now. Go home. Yoga. Eat. Sit! And then think about this as you doze off. Amen.
