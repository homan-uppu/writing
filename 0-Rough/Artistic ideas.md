A friend. A friend to bounce ideas off of. A friend to help you discover awesome things about the world that you didn't think existed.

You're getting caught up in the outcomes. Focus purely on the artistic expression. That's all that matters.

Shut out the part of your mind that analyzes and judges a creation based on economics, reach, scale, etc. Focus solely on making something beautiful and meaningful to YOU, without a care for anything else. This is the mindset that I want to be in right now. And that's it. I want nothing more than pure artistic expression.

I mean, this is all quite hilarious, but why the typing lag? These things are honestly just stupidly hilarious if you ask me. Damn son.
