Asymmetry exists everywhere in our modern world and is accelerating rapidly. It will penetrate every domain, and I don't believe it's possible to slow down this shift.

For many of us, rising asymmetry is making it tougher for us to get what we want out of our lives - whatever that may be. But this isn't because it's somehow more difficult to create value in the world. In fact it's easier than ever! Our difficulties stem from the fact that the habits that enabled us to get what we want in a more symmetrical world no longer help us get what want in an extremely asymmetrical world. Our understanding and habits are incredibly outdated.

A young student that doesn't understand and act according to the growing asymmetry in the world and how that impacts what the world needs in a few years will likely train themselves in ways that won't be relevant.

A startup founder that doesn't understand  and act according to the growing asymmetry will almost certainly fail to build a meaningful company - increasingly so as asymmetry rises.

...

To see why, we need to first understand what causes asymmetry, and why it's changing the way it is.

Asymmetry is a function of complexity and leverage.

We can model the process we follow to get what we want (whatever that may be) as a game. The "winning" criteria is feeling the satiation from getting what we want.
