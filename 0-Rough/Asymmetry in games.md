Let's look at three simple (relative to most of the games we play) games: Tic Tac Toe (simple game), Chess (medium complexity), and Go (high complexity), to get a sense for how asymmetry is related to the complexity of the game.

(*todo: explain why these games differ in complexity*)

**More complex games have a fewer percentage of moves that are equally good.**

The better we get at a game, the more we realize the difference in how good moves are. When we first start out, all moves seem to be "pretty good" since we haven't yet learned the downstream consequences of a move early on.

For example, in Chess, moves and openings that were considered good before computers got good at Chess were later found to be not that great and therefore professionals discarded those moves entirely.

There is a greater asymmetry in the value of moves.

**More complex games have a greater difference between the best and the rest**

We observe that there are fewer draws the more complex the game becomes.

Any game of tic-tac-toe between two “seasoned players” will end in a draw. Chess players at the top of their games will often draw. In Chess championships, many of the games played result in a draw. In Go there rarely if ever any draws between top players.

Another way to notice this difference is to observe the ELO ratings of professional players. ELO ratings is a way to calculate relative skills of players.

> The difference in the ratings between two players serves as a predictor of the outcome of a match. Two players with equal ratings who play against each other are expected to score an equal number of wins. A player whose rating is 100 points greater than their opponent's is expected to score 64%; if the difference is 200 points, then the expected score for the stronger player is 76%

It's important to note that the difference in rating doesn't translate linearly to the difference in wins. Someone who is a thousand ELO rating higher than another will almost certainly win.

In Go, the difference in ELO rating of the top two players is 183 (https://www.goratings.org/en/), whereas the difference in ELO rating of the top two Chess players is 25 (https://www.chess.com/players).

The gap between the best and the next best is far greater in Go than in Chess. Meanwhile there's no need for ELO rating for Tic Tac Toe because every "professional" would draw, meaning everyone's ELO would be zero.

*Yes, there may be differences in how ELO ratings are calculated for each game, but I'm confident that even when you adjust for such differences in calculations, the argument will still hold: the more complex games will have greater asymmetry that does not grow linearly with the difference in complexity.*

**Complex games have a wider spread of ability**

In more complex games we notice a much higher range for the ELO ratings. Meaning ability is spread more widely & the difference between the best and the average also grows. This is why the top ELO rating will be higher for more complex games.
