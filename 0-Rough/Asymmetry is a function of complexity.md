*There is a much better, simpler explanation than the one I have in the essay right now. Aim for the simplicity. Go get it!*

Asymmetry is a function of complexity.

We can model the process we follow to get what we want (whatever that may be) as a game. The "winning" criteria is feeling the satiation from getting what we want. Our process involves making decisions about what to do. Each decision takes us to a point where we see more choices that we have to decide from. [^1]

Therefore, our process to get the things we want resembles a decision tree:

<>.

Complexity of a game can be measured in multiple ways, but in essence they all correlate to how many possibilities exist in the game. A game with 

Complexity of a game is proportional to the number of possibilities, or in other words, the number of possible paths you can take in this tree. More complex games have more possibilities than less complex games. [^2]




Whether you want to build a great company, make an emotionally moving work of art, or even improve your relationships, the process you follow to get what you want resembles this tree because you make choices out of an array of choices available at any given moment in time, and each choice you make influences the choices that are available next.

The advantage of framing our endeavors as games is that we can study the nature of most human endeavors by studying the nature of simpler, more well understood games, and extrapolating those learnings to the games that we play.

Let's look at three simple (relative to most of the games we play) games: Tic Tac Toe (simple game), Chess (medium complexity), and Go (high complexity), to get a sense for how asymmetry is related to the complexity of the game.
