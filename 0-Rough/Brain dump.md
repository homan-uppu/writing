I really would like the app to help me process thoughts. I think it would be a nice little tool to help me express myself more productively (and in a way that is more natural). I ought to flesh this out a bit more. Seriously.

I need to "see". Dune 2 was a good reminder for myself. "Seeing" is the most important asset. That clarity is incredibly important.

The internet is pure poison during this phase. I must dip into my obsession again. That is the only way to do great work. Keep the internet turned off, and grind.

The craving for things pollutes my efforts in the moment. Any craving for things in the future: even making trips to countries, watching a film, or even the craving to get 20 days to meditate, all take you away from embracing, and working with, the present moment.

I'm far from being perfectly content with this moment. I'm still craving the future greatly. The more I crave a future, any future, the more I will not get the future I want (a balanced mind). This is the paradox.

You must fully surrender the future, and completely embrace the present. There is no other way.

Always work on the most important thing. Don't settle for anything less. And be prepared to play the long game.

What are my strengths?

The ability to communicate. This will be my strongest weapon. By far. Everything else will be delegated. That is how I must organize my life. This process of writing, in a way, is also a process of refining my craft. As a means to seek truth, and share those truths with the world for feedback.

And the ability to organize my life around a single thing. I have a lot of room for improvement here, but I'm confident I'll get there one day.

Cut down / cut out the socialization with fam. It's getting to be too much tbh. I need to tap into the obsessiveness even more. That is how great work is done.

Even drop the craving to move back to SF. That craving also poisons your efforts in the moment. Nothing ought to matter more than seeking truth. Seeking truth is the highest priority, absolutely everything else comes after.

There is absolutely nothing more important right now than to flesh out my thinking for "seeking truth is the only skill". It has great implications on what I'm going to do next, and how I'm going to do it.

So yes. I'm not going to spend time doing anything other than working on this essay. Once I publish it, I will take some time to think about what comes next... whether I should do something before the next essay, or jump right into it.

This craft of writing and explaining my ideas is the most powerful skill to have as a truth seeker who wants to collaborate with others. There is no skill more valuable. Use this understanding to give you the patience required to do this well. Hone this craft, no matter how difficult, how laborious it may seem. Truly embrace the grind.

After such a process, the ideas you share with the world must appear to others as so simple, elegant that had naturally just flowed out of my mind to them. That "natural" feeling will take an incredible effort.

Just as Steve Jobs spent months to prepare for a single product presentation.
Just as Kurosawa wrote, wrote, wrote screenplays and always had a handful ready at any moment to turn into a film.
You must accept, and embrace the grind required to do great work.

There is absolutely no other way my friend. Absolutely no other way.

And I'm not going to do anything else until I knock out this first essay.
This is the sort of dogged determination required to see things through. And I have it. For sure.

"Seeking truth about seeking truth".
