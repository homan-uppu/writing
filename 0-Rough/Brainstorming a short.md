*Don't worry about durations, etc. Just focus on the nugget of the story. The seed from which the tree spouts*.

I can definitely set this in a "tribal" setting esque. Not in the modern world, but not overly in the past - maybe a few centuries (*before guns for sure*).

- Strong character evolution. **Weak -> strong.** From being a slave to your Sankharas, to **being able to rise above them**.
- **Constrained setting**. World building in constraints.
- **Forces beyond us that tug at us from within**. Our Sankharas that we simply can't manage. "Where is the choice?". - The more you study the mind, the more you realize that there is no choice. It's a cause and effect. And the effect (reaction) is deeply programmed into your psyche. You can't oppose it without significant mental training.
- Our **frustration with our inability to do what we want.**
- Everything rooted in deep dissatisfaction with life itself. *Suffering plagues our existence.*
- The one that sits above the hilltop watching the drama unfold below. The silent observer. The mere, objective, observer. Doesn't take sides. Knows there are reasons for the conflict on both sides. The only solution is letting it go. But neither side will accept... for completely valid reasons! The difficulty in finding a "right answer" to life's situations. It just flows. We're all taken for a ride. There is no sense to it all when you look beneath the surface level drama.
- Humility. Life teaches. Especially those who think they're "better" than others. They are humbled beyond measure. Smacked to the ground.
- Turning a bleak situation to your advantage. Somehow, someway finding the means to rise above adversity.
- **What is Truth?** Who to believe? What are their reasons? Is there even an objective Truth for what happened? There is always a bias. History is biased.
- **Contrast**. Two lives. Brothers. One sacrifices everything for the other. Or one significantly stronger than the other, though initially they appear to be the same (e.g. Musashi & Matahachi).
- I really like the trope of the peace loving fighter. The one who resists war no matter what. Until pushed over the edge for some reason. And then their true power is unleashed for the world to see. That build up. That hype. You know they have something cray up their sleeves. It's a tease until it finally comes out. Then it's just... damn. You expected it. You knew it would arrive. But it still surprises you beyond your expectations. (e.g. RRR interval scene. We all saw it coming, yet we didn't).
- There's some notion of a "world". A new world.
- Stories teach us about ourselves.
- Easy times build weak men. Weak men lead to hard times. Hard times build strong men. And the cycle repeats.

Some additional constraints:
1. Set in modern day world. (requires far less money to make. You don't need to sacrifice the strength of the characters in any sense. Modern day humans can be quite powerful). But, you can definitely 
## Characters

### Crazy old man
A crazy old man (appears to be in his 70's) that represents the Truth. All he seems to do is talk to himself, laugh, sing songs and believe that he's in contact with the Goddess of the forest (Adavi Thalli). There is nothing else on his mind. The villagers don't pay him much attention. They throw a meal in his direction every now and then to keep him alive, but he never begs for it. Keeps to himself. Lost in his crazy world. Harmless... couldn't hurt a fly.
> He has an intense backstory. A master swordsman (dual swords) who was once the protector of the village head (or throne). He sticks around in the village because he once gave his word that he'd dedicate his life towards protecting the village from any external threats (why?). Very intense human being underneath the nonchalance.
### Blind old flutist
Similar vibe as the crazy old man. Another guardian of the village. Perhaps best friends with the crazy old man. We don't know.
### A sacrifice from each family. For protecting the village.

### Kai.
A boy, teenager, and man (3 phases).
Born into a drama that he has no say in. No choice.
Either pick the sword, or shy away from your responsibilities.
Son of the *former head of the village*. After the reunification.
Peace loving. Tries his best to shy away from conflict. But conflict chases him as if it were his destiny. A destiny he can't shy away from. As if it were deeply entrenched in his psyche 

He's not afraid of the sword. He's afraid of who he'll becomes once he touches the sword. He's not afraid of the violence. He's afraid of his lust for violence. He's afraid of losing his sense of self once he touches his blade. He's afraid of himself.

The wise old man reminds him that he still has a choice. He doesn't need to pick up the sword. He can renounce everything and leave it all behind. But, if you pick up the sword, consider this life dedicated to this cause. You cannot back out if you pick it up. This inner conflict. **This turmoil is the interval bang.**
### History of the village
3 decades ago, there was a battle between the 3 neighboring tribes.
The victor established an era of peace.

## Research
- Any notion of celibate warriors? I'm not sure.

## Scenes

### The bonfire + fight pre-climax.
The crazy old man gets the villagers to perform a ritual for the Adavi Thalli. They light up a bonfire and furiously dance to the beat of powerful drums, all holding hands, circling the fire.

Kai is sitting next to the circle at the base of the tree, unable to make sense of this mass hysteria. He has no idea how this is going to help. He has no idea if there even is an Adavi Thalli. He has no belief. On the other side of the village, the warriors are awaiting the attack from the neighboring tribes.

Kai sits here helplessly because he doesn't want to contribute to the war in any way. He doesn't want anything to do with it. He believes it's meaningless. He doesn't care who "wins" the battle, as long as all the tribes are eventually re-united and go back to their usual ways of collaborating with, and doing business with, each other. He's committed to not fight.

### The hidden warriors.
A small, but powerful battalion, trained from the age of 3 in the art of warfare and mind control. Celibate. They are monks. Training for mastering their minds. They have a strict policy to not interfere in the squabbles of lesser men. They will not lend their support to any side. They only train for their own self defense. They've been prosecuted and tormented through history and they will not allow themselves to be subjugated under anyone else's rule again.

They're trained to have intense pain tolerance. To have relatively better mastery over their minds, their emotions.

Anyone who has their support will win. It's that simple. But they don't lend support to anyone. So, there's a contradiction. A challenge. Perhaps their stance isn't that strong? Or perhaps the circumstances are more grave than ever before.

Or perhaps Kai was raised by them.
