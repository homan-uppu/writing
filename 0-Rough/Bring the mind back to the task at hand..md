OK then, what would be good next steps?

The thing can't draw SVGs, so need to get it to do that well. Definitely leaning towards fine-tuning. Let's see how well it can do that... But are you sure that's the right first step here? I'm honestly not sure.

But, that's a reasonable starting point. Just be able to draw the shapes.

But what shapes can it NOT draw? Why don't you start there as well? Look at visualizevalue's work, and see what you need to do.

Just get through this "MVP" for myself. Only think about the market and how to expand it once you've nailed this really well: i.e. shapes, layout, colors and some text (with custom font). That's all you need.

Pretty straightforward. Seriously. Just need to see it through. Optimize entirely for the visualizevalue - esque outputs. That's all you need for now.

See, once you nail that you can really adapt it for a wide range of use-cases. That's for sure.

So yeah, stay focused on the task. Keep streaming it and publishing progress. And just keep at it brother. Seriously. Just keep at it. Only good things can come from this. Absolutely.

Potential next iterations:
- Fine tune to enable drawing shapes.
- Rendering: I'm not sure a black square is the best canvas size and style. - You ought to start with what you're trying to create and then work backwards.
	- If the goal is to enable creating shapes (and icons), then you ought to start with just the square box. That's all you need to render shapes right?

What is the next step here for this text to image app?

Fine-tune with a massive icon pack to svg.

And you probably want to replicate some more complex shapes and stuff in Figma to make the training data extremely high quality. - Probably.

Yeah, spend the time today crafting a solid 50 example data set. High quality, that represents the kind of shapes, etc. I'm looking to draw.

Don't worry about the layout stuff at all. Just get it to draw the damn thing.

And keep the goal of the fine-tuning extremely narrow.
