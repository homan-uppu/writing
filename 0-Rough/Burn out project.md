I'm burned out. I'm just going to create a video for fun. No expectations about the results. Nothing. Just going to make a short "film" for the sake of making a short film. Amen. That's it.

I'm going to give myself a month to ship something I'm proud of. Once that's done, I'm going to assess my situation calmly and execute. That's it.

Just create for the sake of creating. It can be absolute crap. Complete nonsense. But it doesn't matter. Just create it.

The challenge with the image creation app is that I don't really want to create any of the outputs that it enables me to create. It's like building a developer productivity tool without knowing what to use that productivity boost towards. Lol.
