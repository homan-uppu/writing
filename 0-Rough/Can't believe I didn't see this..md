This is the path.
Wow.
So. Damn. Obvious.

I've found what I love. And I'm just going to keep doing this. Amen.

For this first phase, JUST build for yourself.

Just keep creating.

And just keep talking about creating (on Twitter, and eventually on Youtube and TikTok as well - when you have some leverage).

This is the fucking path.

Be patient. Let it come to you.

And even the things I talk about ought to be around studying apps.
For example: WeChat, Tiaotiao, etc.

This is it. This is the path. Amen brother. Amen.
