I need to convince myself before I can convince anyone else of anything.
This writing process, however long it may take, is absolutely necessary. Without it I know for a fact that I'm going to quit whatever I start because I haven't done the work to convince myself first.

So yes. I can't help but do what I'm doing right now.

The only choices I have are in how I organize the day around writing. I.e. how much do I sit? When? What is the schedule? Diet? Etc. And that's it.

If you're struggling to get words out and get the thoughts flowing, simply sit. That's all you can do. There is absolutely nothing else you can do. The mind needs to naturally flow, and only then can you do great work. It has to flow. And you simply cannot force it.

This phase is a great teacher: it will teach you the optimal way to work to create the kind of work you want to create.

Even right now I notice great tension in my body preventing me from dropping into the zone. The mind is incredibly fascinating. Damn son.

Dude, spend the entire year writing if you need to. You should not rush this process and end up on a suboptimal hill climbing exercise. Think things through, share with the world, engage with the world. Have the equanimity and patience to see this through.

If you're agitated by how long things are taking, and how weak your mind is, then meditate! There is nothing else to be done. I'm serious.

Absolutely nothing else to be done brother. Absolutely nothing else. Turn off the internet, and create.

If you want to, build the app to help you capture more thoughts and ideas. That's not a bad thing. And could be a neat little side project for the time being as you process more ideas in between essays. - Yeah, I dig that. You can take a week break between essays (I mean, you can still record all the thoughts you have in the app as you build it) to build an MVP of the app that you can use regularly moving forward to think.

But yeah, you must choose the right hill to climb. It will dictate the next decade of your life (at the least). Amen.

The grind is brutal my friend. Absolutely brutal. Embrace it. There is no other path :).
