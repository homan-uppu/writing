If I can do this well, I will have succeeded. In many ways, this is the most important system that I need to build. Amen.

Protect my attention from poisonous distractions. Direct it instead towards what is beneficial. This itself is the foundation of the practice: regulating attention at the most mundane level. Being incredibly cautious about how the mind drifts.

Become a gatekeeper to your own mind. This is an essential skill.

There is a product here that I need. I'm OK manually scraping and doing a bunch of legwork to "add to it", but the consumption and note-taking experience must be exceptional. That is what I want. The have a stellar consumption experience for long-form content, the ability to annotate, and audit my consumption on a regular (prob weekly) basis.

Reading + annotation. I want all of my consumption to go through this single "gate". The final passage before it enters my mind.

So, should I be building this? Yes. I want to do this. Keep everything local for now - and simply back up via GIT. Actually yeah, just make it another folder within /writing - or even better, just make it your "inputs" folder. In other words - inputs will be managed by this "other app".

I like this thought. Minimize building. Just focus on the excellent consumption and annotation experience. And then make that the primary means of information consumption for the foreseeable future. Amen.

And it's laser focused for only consumption (and annotating what I'm consuming).

When referencing the annotations, etc. I can just have that window next to my Obsidian window - as if they were basically the same app. One for things to go into my brain, the other for things to come out of my brain. Powerful.

I don't even need a search or any fancy tagging system or anything.

What I need:
- Beautiful reading experience. Any file format converted into the same beautiful reading experience.
- Mark as done.
- Menu bar categorization: done, todo. When marked as done, moves to "done". Can mark as "undone" as well. Make this a keyboard shortcut for now (no need for any custom menus, etc.)
- Notes about the piece itself (at the top - can use this box as a place for hashtags later on if needed).
- Highlight.
- Annotate.
- "Trash"

Nice to have:
1. Table of contents for longer content (e.g. books).
2.

### Workflow
- Whenever content seems to be drying up, I go on the hunt to find the best, most enriching knowledge out there to add to my collection.
- This is the only place I consume from. Amen.
