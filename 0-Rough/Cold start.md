I remember back in college there was a ripe group of a few hundred students that I could reach out to immediately. I've lost that leverage. I need to work a lot harder to get the initial distribution.

There's no choice but to be really smart about how I get my work out there to kickstart this momentum. And it will happen. There's no doubt about it.
