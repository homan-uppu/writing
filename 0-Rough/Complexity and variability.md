**More complex activities have greater variance in ability regardless of the quality of education and duration of training**.

No matter how much training startup founders / creators / marketers have, there is bound to be large variance in ability. By ability I mean how well they can create value in their field: generate revenue, engagement, etc.

By complexity of an activity I mean the number of possibilities in the activity. A factory worker has a limited number of choices at any given moment in time. Their productivity is primarily measured by speed of assembly, not the quality of their choices. An artist on the other hand has an infinite number of choices and possibilities, making their work far more complex.

For simpler activities, with sufficient training, it is possible to become close to the best in terms of ability. The difference in productivity between the best and average factory worker is nowhere near the difference in productivity of the best startup founder and an average one: the average founder fails, and the best one achieves unimaginable outcomes.

This is completely independent of the quality of education. Even if the best entrepreneur or artist coached students 24/7 for decade, they would see a great variance in ability. There will be some who are just better at making things people want than others because the activity itself is far more complex.

If we could plot relative ability of professionals on a graph, we would notice it follows a power law distribution. The differences between players is not linear: difference in ability of best to 2nd best is greater than the difference between the 2nd and 3rd best, and so on.

The more complex the activity the more pronounced the differences: the gap in ability between the best creator and the next best is many orders of magnitude greater than the difference between the best factory worker and the next best.

**The more complex an activity, the more similar in ability two individuals are, the further from the best they are.**

*Side notes that may or may not make it:*
- Someone unable to create value will not be valued by the world sooner or later and won't be able to make a living.

Assembling furniture is relatively simple. An able bodied person with some amount of training will be able to effectively do it and contribute to a world that requires such work.

Building an average, useful, software application is more complex. No matter how well trained two individuals are, there will be some differences in their ability.

Building a successful business, arts, marketing are more complex. No matter how much training someone has, they may not be able to do work that is good enough for the world, and therefore they may never make a good living from it.*******
