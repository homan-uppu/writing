Even when you're writing a longer essay, or even a book, you should be able to communicate the essence of that knowledge in a short-form: via a tweet storm / short essay.

If you can't communicate the essence in short-form, then you don't really understand what you're trying to communicate.

And: the great short-form explanation is what will attract people to come and consume the longer form. **Without the short-form, you can't get distribution for your work.**

Masters of any skill also tend to be masters of simple, concise explanations because it's a byproduct of mastery.
