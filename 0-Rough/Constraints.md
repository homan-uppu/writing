Cut out the options. 

This is your office space. This is where you're going to do your work. That's it. There's no need to overcomplicate. If you face roadblocks, deal with them the best you can and just keep moving forward. Keep taking the steps forward. 

That's all you need to do. 
That's all you can do.

Cut the crap. Embrace the challenge. Sit with the discomfort. Push through.
