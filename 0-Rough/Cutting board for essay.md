**5. Harder to justify hiring unproven talent**

When bar for creativity was lower, as a company, you could hire unproven junior talent and take the responsibility to train them for the job.

From a company's perspective, as a skill becomes more creative, they can't justify this type of hiring because there's no guarantee in the outcomes.

Case study: if you could train 1000 employees out of which 500 end up being competent in 2 years, that's alright. But in creative skills, the variance in outcomes can be extremely high, making this entire proposition incredibly risky. On top of this, companies are generally bad at firing. By letting in a large number of incompetent employees, you've killed the culture of the company.

An interesting aside here is that if a "master" is charging money for their knowledge and personalized feedback, you should be cautious. Either they're not that good, because if they were, the market would reward them for their work


**4. Teaching a creative skill is also a creative skill.**

When learning syntax (principles, rules, etc.) isn't enough to be competent at a skill, then the best way to learn it is through personalized feedback from a master to help you train the intuition for how to create something of value.

For non-creative skills, for which learning the syntax is enough to make you competent, an average teacher can still enable students to learn the syntax, since it can be done in a standardized way.

But, the more creative the skill you're trying to learn, the more important the quality of the teacher is.
