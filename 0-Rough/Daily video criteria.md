1. No editing whatsoever. It goes up as it is. When you publish an essay / a tweet with that concept, just link to the YT video as a ("the braindump that led to this").

Why?
- Just gain comfort talking to the camera.
- No editing = more natural, less work, and more skill in how you carry forward the conversation. It helps build the art of conversing since you can't rely on editing to save your communication.

That's it. I'll reference the video in the essay on Substack. And thus, Substack will be the "final form" of the idea. Great.
