This is my craft for now. I want to become excellent at translating my feelings to words. This is the foundation I'm going to focus on. Nothing else. 

I'm going to become great at this skill this year. This is seriously all I'm going to focus on this year. Absolutely nothing else. Only after I've gotten to where I'd say I'm "good enough" to be able to translate my feelings into words, I will explore how to "implement" these ideas or feelings into the world.

My greatest weakness right now is conciseness. There are much simpler ways of communicating what I'm feeling, and I'm struggling to get to that "simplicity". I've found it in a few areas (e.g. explaining complexity and leverage, fairness), but I haven't gotten it overall (there seem to be some "more than necessary" bits), and I haven't gotten it in some sections (e.g. )

Let's go get it!
