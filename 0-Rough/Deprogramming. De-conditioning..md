This is the practice. The practice automatically does this, not as a goal that you have when you start, but as a natural byproduct to practicing.

Yes, there certainly is a goal. The goal is to rise above the Sankharas. To rise above the various conditionings of the mind to reach the unconditioned state. But, the point is that the unconditioned state cannot be achieved by craving for it as the craving itself is conditioning. 

You must have sufficient desire to even take up the path, but must ensure that desire doesn't turn into an unbalanced craving - which implies that you're walking in the opposite direction of what you're seeking.

There is an extraordinary possibility in life. But, you must first move beyond your conditioning. You must dig deep to remove the heaps of poisonous conditionings that you've unconsciously accumulated.
