Yesterday all I had was the almond butter and macademia milk thing. I had a bit too much after the Yoga practice and it really didn't sit well in my stomach, so I went to bed right away.

I ought to constrain diet even further. One meal a day and you will have no issues, that's guaranteed. You just have to do it. And I fully acknowledge that it's tougher than it seems.

But, it must be done. Without a doubt.

And it might be good to not eat after the evening Yoga session. I want to sleep on an empty stomach. Eventually move the Yoga to the morning, and have lunch, but skip dinner. Amen. But that's tough. It's far easier to skip breakfast and lunch and just do dinner. But you lose out on the empty stomach sleeping - which feels important for some reason (and is what the Buddha prescribed as well). Maybe put it to a test? Experiment with it. I have a feeling the no food in the evening is better for the stomach since I'd be sleeping on an empty stomach. Amen.

Best of both worlds would be eating around 5 / 6 pm. Fascinating. The Yoga time really doesn't work with this huh. Lol.
