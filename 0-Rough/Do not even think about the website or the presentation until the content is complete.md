I need each word to have earned their right to be included in the essay. This is the level of obsession required to ship great work. There is no way around this. Remember the power law: only the absolute best work will be recognized. There is no room for average anything. Instead of writing 10, or even 100 average essays, focus on making each one GREAT. This is the habit you must keep working on.

Another way to look at it: make the script great. Focus on how to translate that script into an excellent product later. The script is the foundation for the product. Make it excellent.

And, even when you do, keep it simple. Don't worry about fonts. Use mostly the same font. Stick to system / Inter. that's it. That is not where you need to be spending your time. These fonts are excellent. Focus efforts on the presentation layer: layouts, spacings, font colors, thoughtfully placed components, etc. That is where the innovation needs to be.
