That should not even be a concern during the drafting stages. Make it as long as you want it to be. Each sub-section you have right now feels meaningful. Each feels like a necessary question / explanation. Flesh it out in detail.

When it's time to cut and prune, I shall. That is a different muscle, and that is for a different phase of writing. Not now.

Just flesh it out. Trust the mind. Trust the process.
