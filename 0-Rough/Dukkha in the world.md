The more I see people performing on social media and in general how we live our lives in the modern world, the more convinced I am that there is just so, so much suffering.

Suffering exists everywhere we look. Modern lifestyle itself is pure suffering. I failed to see it like this till now.

If I'm going to be with someone, they must have a strong desire and discipline to overcome their own suffering. A serious practitioner who is on a similar path. To have the privilege of such a partner, you yourself must be significantly leveled up first. There is no chance otherwise.

There is absolutely no sense to FOMO. Absolutely none. Life is a single player game. Hopefully you progress towards greater peace and happiness. That is in your hands. All that remains is a diligent practice.
