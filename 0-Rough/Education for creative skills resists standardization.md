- What is **standardization**?
- Why standardization in education and hiring doesn't work for creative skills.

----

Standardization is a one-size fits all approach to education.
- Same curriculum for everyone.
- Same assignments
- Same exams, with questions with a limited range of possible answers.

Position this differently: creative skills resists standardized evaluation. (Justify this, and use this to explain how the current education system doesn't work - since it's extremely standardized, and why there can't be a standard system for hiring).

Standardized evaluation exists in both education and in hiring. This is a way to evaluate the competence of someone in a one-size fits all way: often through a quiz like structure in which each question has a finite range of possible "right answers". 

This setup enables efficiency and scale: it lets you scale theory, curriculums, assignments, etc. to millions of students around the world. Grading is also a lot simpler when there's a clear "right" answer. You can automate it, or affordably hire teaching assistants who aren't masters of the skill grade it.

But it simply doesn't work for creative skills. At most, with standardized evaluation, you can gauge a person's understanding of the syntax for how to do something, not their competence in the creative skill itself.

Why doesn't it work? Let's try to see how we can design a standardized test to identify great musicians. How could we go about it? Quizzing them on musical syntax for a particular instrument is useless because we need to identify creative skill, not rote understanding.

We basically need some way to determine if their music is "good" or not. But it's difficult to codify what good even means in a way that lets you standardize the interview to any candidate.
