Finalize the title and the high level outline.

### Title
- **Why college is outdated**.
- Why college no longer works.
### Outline
- It's not working
	- Provide proof.
	- **The massive scale of the problem**. And also why it's one of the most important problems to tackle.
		- Get stats on number of 18 years olds on the planet. This is a ridiculous number. Wow.
	- I mean, it's just ridiculous how massive this problem is. (why this is important to think about).
- The average college education is useless.
	- Case studies
- Misaligned incentives.
- Yet, college is difficult to displace
- Standardized education no longer works
	- Rising bar for creativity (due to greater technological leverage).
- Promising experiments to rewrite education (keep this short - i.e. touch on each of these below, but don't go into crazy depth. Leave that for the individual essays. Amen.)
	- Investing in individuals.
	- AI copilots.
	- UBI - some sort of free money to young people to experiment and create.

### Notes

Learnings from experiments:
- MOOCs don't work because access to high quality knowledge isn't the problem. It's purpose - or rather the security that studying will help you build a meaningful life. Very few learn for the sake of learning.
- Bootcamps don't work because standardized, time constrained education doesn't build competence for a creative skill.
- Alternate credentialing doesn't work because standardized interviewing / exams don't work for creative domains

The business model of exchanging money for an education with an assurance that you can make up your investment doesn't work for creative domains because the output is no longer guaranteed.

That business model worked for domains that didn't require much creativity. Naval's "If you can teach it, it'll be automated".
