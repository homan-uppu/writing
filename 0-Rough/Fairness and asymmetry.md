Still, we can't accept that asymmetry and inequality are bound to rise without discussing fairness.

The world is different than board games in that fairness is not equally distributed. In Chess, if it were the case that a player had 10x the time on the clock to make their moves, then naturally the one with more time would likely win - given they've both had intensive professional training for their entire lives.

But, counterintuitively, an unfair world is more equal than a fair one. We can sniff out unfairness by seeing how much equality there is in the entire system.

For example:

In a world with greater equality of outcomes, an outlier is more likely a result of unfairness.
In a world with greater inequality of outcomes, an outlier is more likely a result of fairness.

This can be true while it's also true that upward mobility is more difficult. But the reason is that upward mobility is more difficult because we have outdated habits, not because of unfairness. The level of unfairness is decreasing as a function of leverage (may need to substantiate).

(*Fairness has nothing to do with luck. It could be possible that someone finds themselves at the right place at the right time for some reason. That is very different than saying that there is inherent unfairness in the game. I'll explore in a later essay luck vs. skill, but a more fair world will lead to greater asymmetry.*)
