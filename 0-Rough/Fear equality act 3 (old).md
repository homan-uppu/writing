Even if we intellectually agree that our games are becoming more complex, and therefore there is accelerating asymmetry, I assure you that we are all incredibly bad at acting according to this intellectual understanding. The optimal way to get what we want in this world looks very different than what we do.

Our intuitions for how to get what we want are extremely outdated because they've been shaped by a world with much lesser asymmetry. The stories we tell each other, our education systems, government policies, etc. are all still stuck in a world with far less asymmetry. And our intuitions are shaped by all of our life experiences leading to this point which are influenced greatly by the cultures we grew up in.

And this is precisely what leads to the paradox that we see in society today. There is a small fraction of individuals in this world that have found it easier than ever to get what they want because they've built the intuition for how to operate in an extremely asymmetric world, whereas those that haven't are quite vocal about how it's becoming much more difficult to get what they want (e.g. to have a nice home, affording kids, eating 3 healthy meals a day, and fulfilling basic human desires).

This paradox exists because even though it's easier than ever to manifest our ideas, create value in the world and capture that value to afford the the things we want, most of us don't have the intuition to do this well [^5]. For example: the salaries for useful jobs (e.g. software engineer) will skyrocket because there is unlimited demand for those who can operate well in such asymmetry, while yet most candidates applying for the job will be rejected and feel that the market is bad. This paradox is accelerating and will penetrate every domain as it's a direct reflection of asymmetry.

By "intuition", I mean the instinctive force that can be felt. It's a sort of muscle memory that pulls you to do things a certain way. It is not active, conscious thinking about what to do.

Because intuition exists in the realm of feeling, it's often felt as an emotion. For example, a company founder with great intuition feels appropriate fear that guides them in the right direction. They fear hiring the wrong person because they know through experience how dangerous that is, whereas a novice founder likely doesn't have the same fear, and therefore will burn themselves. [^6]

This difference in intuition is also why advice is interpreted differently. You can tell someone to be very cautious about who they hire, but unless they cultivate the intuitive emotional response to guide them, they'll invariably not internalize the advice optimally - in the way that it was intended by the person who told them.

And this is why even though we may intellectually see that the world is extremely asymmetric, we all lack the appropriate intuitive, emotional response to enable us to act optimally.

...

I believe our lack of an intuitive fear towards equality is a large factor in what holds us back. 

The less equal the world becomes, the more we suffer from our lack of fear of equality. Not only do we not fear equality, we actually crave it! To cultivate appropriate fear, we have to first undo our craving to see equality everywhere we look.

For example, a leader of a team should be incredibly alarmed when two team members are performing equally well because that means at least one of the following is true:

A. **The team members are under-leveraged**: they are playing simpler games than is possible because they aren't using tools available in the world well enough. Recent advancement in leverage certainly means that an optimal employee would have offloaded all simpler work to technology and moved up towards playing more complex tasks. And this also means that they're moving slower than they could, meaning the underlying asymmetry will take longer to be exposed. This could be for many reasons including the culture of the company, the expectations the leader has for their team, etc.

B. **The team members are not as competent as they ought to be**. Even with the appropriate leverage, if there isn't a drastic difference, it likely means that they are at the lower end of the skill spectrum. As we saw in our study of simpler games, the better the player gets, the more they separate themselves from the next best player, increasingly so. It's only at the lower end of the skill spectrum where we see greater equality.

C. **The leader is terrible at assessing performance** because if the employees are appropriately leveraged and competent, a large difference should have been apparent.

In a highly asymmetric world, teams in which members perform equally well are teams that will certainly be outcompeted, because equality is incredibly rare the more complex the games become.

Yet, in the modern workforce we celebrate when we see an entire team has equally good outputs. Remember, that was the right celebration back when we worked in factories, or when we were hunter gatherers, because in such simple games if there was not equal output, it was almost certainly because someone was slacking. Now, equal output almost certainly means something is lacking.

The intuition for when inequality is due to slacking or lacking will be invaluable.

This is one of the many, many situations in which we have lack the appropriate fear towards equality.

A parent that enrolls their child in a school should be terrified if all the children appear to be doing equally well (all achieve high test scores). Because that certainly means that test is far from assessing the skill required to thrive in today's extremely asymmetric world.

A prospective student evaluating educational programs should be terrified if they see equal outcomes for graduates. If those outcomes are jobs, then the companies then it means that the majority of the companies hiring these students are likely incredibly suboptimal and won't survive as the world becomes more asymmetric. If those outcomes are some scores, then those scores are certainly disconnected from reality, and won't matter eventually.

...

When our intuition is lacking and we want to train it, heuristics are helpful to train better habits.

One heuristic I've found helpful is to pause whenever I think something is equal, because the notion of equality is almost certainly a delusion as we're all playing quite complex games in a highly leveraged world.

We also need to be more compassionate. Evolution has hardwired us to respect less those that achieve less. This was a useful conditioning back when we were hunters & gatherers because it was likely true that if someone achieved less, they were slacking. And this fear of being perceived lesser than another pushed us to become better at doing our work, which increased the probability that our tribe survives and we pass on our genes.

This evolutionary conditioning is especially dangerous in an extremely asymmetric world because it'll make most of us incredibly unhappy. In a free world with high leverage it's likely that a friend, neighbor, or someone we know, younger, less experienced, etc. will achieve orders of magnitude greater outcomes than we do. This will become increasingly common.

In other words, jealousy was incredibly useful to grow our species, but is incredibly outdated in an extremely asymmetric world. In a hunger gatherer tribe, if you weren't jealous and didn't strive to do as well as others in your tribe, you'd likely be ostracized because there wouldn't be enough food for everyone. Yet today, jealousy primarily acts to wreak havoc on mental health with no upside.

...

I want to be clear, I believe we must still crave for equality of opportunity. That is the only craving that we must not only preserve, but cultivate. That is still the right craving to have to create a more fair, and just world. But we need to realize that equal opportunity actually creates more extreme asymmetry in outcomes, and we must accept that and build a world in alignment with this reality. 

If we don't want greater asymmetry, it also means that we don't want human progress since asymmetry is a function of leverage. It also means that we don't want people to be more free because more free people invent things that increase leverage.

I wish you the best in training yourself to thrive in an extremely asymmetric world. We all have a lot of work to do. 

In this essay I've only scratched the surface of how we ought to train ourselves to take advantage of an extremely asymmetric world. This shift has great consequences that impact every single aspect of our lives. In subsequent essays, I'll explore what those impacts are, and what we can do about it for the most important aspects.
