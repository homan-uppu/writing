I feel like the biggest bozo / piece of shit on the planet.
Wow.

What's up with this feeling?

This feeling of being absolutely worthless. Hmm... that's an interesting feeling.

You should just create for the sake of creating for now. Fuck the "business" angle for a couple of weeks. Hmm...

This may just be the lowest you feel about yourself. The only way to go is upwards. Amen.
