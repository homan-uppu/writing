It does not take full advantage of my strengths.
I have unfinished business to do on the product side.
And I feel like my creativity in the realm of filmmaking is grounded in ego: the craving to be noticed, for status. Whereas my feelings in the realm of building companies has some element of wanting to change the world for the better.

The more ego focused my creativity becomes, the more unhappy I become. Therefore, for the sake of my own happiness, I want to focus on company building, not status seeking.
