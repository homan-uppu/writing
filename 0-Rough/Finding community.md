Let community form organically. Do good work. Put it out there. Cold message and cold email people to build relationships. Go to get togethers when invited. Have group chats as a natural byproduct of the work you're doing or the thoughts you're thinking.

But if you don't work on yourself first and find the balance in your own solitude, you're not going to be able to bring yourself to others.

The same with starting relationships: romantic or otherwise. You need to have a solid foundation of your self first! How can you bring positivity to a new relationship when you aren't at ease in solitude?

"**Sadhguru:** The more lonely and depressed you feel, the more the need for company. The more joyful and exuberant you become, the less you will need company. So if you feel lonely when you are alone, that means you are obviously in bad company! If you were with a good person, why would you feel lonely? You would feel great. **People’s idea of exuberance is “Let’s talk, let’s dance, let’s listen to music, let’s do this, let’s do that!” But you can just sit quietly and be absolutely exuberant."**

Well said.

I buy this. If I can't handle solitude, what the hell can I even bring to someone else? Or a community for that matter?

If I can't be in exuberance by just sitting by myself without stimulation, then that's the first thing I ought to work on! Right? Logically speaking. Absolutely.

I need to lean into this phase as if it were an opportunity for me to build ease in solitude, dispassion in my approach to actions, and a deep concentration (Samadhi) so that I can be steadfastly situated in the present moment, accepting reality as it is.

That's what phase is: **an opportunity**.

Eventually, naturally put yourself out there, and reach out to have meaningful conversations with the right people. Amen.

Thoughts:

My highest priority ought to be to catch negative thoughts and to let them go without letting them influence how I feel too much. In fact, this is the only thing I need to do, and everything else will flow.

I need to stop letting my ego influence how I feel to this extent. I need to "lose myself" in whatever I'm doing.

When writing, just write. When building, only build. When drinking, only drink. Eliminate the rumination and the mental drama that exists behind all the actions that you do. That's the harmful "maya" / illusion / delusion that keeps you from experiencing the present as it is.

And honestly, that's all the practice is. It's nothing more than complete absorption into the reality of this moment, without the delusion of the ego.

That's all it is. The task is exceptionally simple. Incredibly difficult.

But, if you can master this during this exceptionally challenging phase, you will grow incredibly.

Why are you so isolated right now? Is this what you want? Is this how you thrive? Hmm...

I don't think so. I think I do a lot better with a team and community. 100%. I'm not a fan of this kind of isolation. It eats at me. 

But at the same time, I can thrive if I'm meditating for most of the day. That's

Need to think through this aspect of my life. Seriously. Momentum is important. Need to kickstart somehow. And quickly.

The isolation isn't that healthy for me either. I want, need, that feeling of working with a team. Seriously.

So yeah, I buy this as a reasoning to join a team.

At the same time, I want to find my own voice in this world. I want to create. I want to be able to build the momentum that I need. Seriously.

The goal here is an inner one. Always remember that.

Write this out. Think this through. Or rather, just get to executing. Amen.

You just have to keep moving forward. That's the only way really. Amen.

Your "Mojo" will come back. Just stay the course with great habits. That's all you can do.

You must meditate as much as possible.

This phase is an opportunity to really strengthen your mind. You can come out of this in the best mental shape you've ever been in.

I think it's important to see the opportunity for growth in your own suffering. Seriously. Push through this. See this through. Amen brother.

Also, the quality of the community matters much more than just having a community for the sake of having a community. Seriously.

I do think the India routine would be more powerful:
- Yoga and meditation / the occasional run - first thing in the morning.
- Create.
- Every Sunday: Dhamma Khetta for a one day course. You can make it every single Sunday. What a powerful environment.

But unfortunately, you don't have this opportunity at the moment. And that's fine. You have to face your current challenging situation with strength, and see it through. Only after that, think about this sort of planning.

You literally have a dream set up right here (from an external perspective). You just have to see this through - whatever that means. And that COULD mean joining a team; there's nothing wrong with that at all. But ideally, you figure out how to build your team and get this off the ground. Amen.

I need to have a routine. A system that will elevate my mind. Absolutely. And then just keep at it like a Tapasya. No distractions. No dejection. Just simple, raw, hard work with complete exhaustion. Amen.

And yes, keep streaming! Get in the habit of just putting yourself out there without expectations of anything in return. Amen.
