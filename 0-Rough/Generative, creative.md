What a crazy world we're heading towards: crazy powerful tools to create whatever you can imagine. Immediately. For free.

Taste is the most important skill to have. Knowing what feels good and what doesn't.

With good taste + imagination + good communication, you thrive.

A game changing tool would be: **storyboard -> scene (in your style).**

That would be incredibly powerful. Like, so damn powerful. Everyone's a director. They have the leverage of an entire team of technicians.

v0.dev is quite interesting: that's the angle to take any creation tool in. They were thoughtful in the social design. Take notes.

That iterated quite a bit will create a significantly more powerful way to build software.

There's going to be a marketplace for "taste". "Templates" to get started with. Tuning already tuned models.

Tuning what's been tuned on something that's been tuned. The layers of fine-tuning. Models that can output a certain way will be incredibly valuable.

What would training those models look like? Fascinating. This is the research that will be super useful. Hm

It's time to be prolific. In everything: both in the art you create. And in the tools you build for creators. In everything.

You're just going to fucking create.

Today is about figuring out the "ramp" to take. What is the kind of creation? What are the constraints? What is the social angle? What are compelling futures to help enable? What is the identity you're going to embody for this phase, and why?

Think about these questions (as briefly as possible), and get to **doing**. That's the crux of today: to get to doing. Amen.
