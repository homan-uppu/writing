**Seeking truth is the only skill**. Think this through first before moving on. I have a lot to flesh out before I can just "move on". Absolutely.

Think this through. Less from the perspective of a "guide" for others, but now from the perspective of what tools and systems do we need to be better at seeking truth. A first principles understanding and exploration.

That's the angle to approach this. Think very, very deeply about this problem. To a level of depth that not many people must have thought about. And have no preconceived notions about what it means to act on this exploration (e.g. what kind of company, if a company, etc. etc.). Focus first on an honest exploration. That's all you can do at the moment.
