ok read it

so the core thesis of "we are not good at realizing how fast leverage is changing" and "people are going to be increasingly skewed in their production" im aligned on
i think i have nits here and there but my main take is honestly who are you writing this for exactly?

youve chosen to use the word inequality as a core concept of your essay and i understood as i read it that you really meant inequality of outcome when you stared talking about fairness

this clarity comes, imo, a little late

i think saying that you beileve a child of an investment banker in nyc vs the child of a carpenter in orissa are not on equal footing and thats unfair and that you dont like that is an important moment in the essay (i know you didnt use those examples) because uptil then its not totally clear if you mean that you like people being systematically pushed down ðŸ˜… which you do eventually state results in a "flatness" and "grouping"of  people in a way  that this "inequality" actually breaks

so i think just kind of thinking through the strategy of who you want to convince here, like this feels very pandering to an already existing crowd, plenty of the world is pretty anti tech and may not get to the point where you talk about fairness because its too buried

ok the second point is less me imaging others and more about how i felt reading it

the examples about joe being negative examples felt....uneccesary? like you can make those same points in a neutral way, instead joe is a failed jobless revolutionary with an addiction problem ðŸ˜…

I believe itd be possible to say there are both happy and sad paths for joe OR even just show the happy path, you can still make the points you make imo

this could just be how you feel and maybe you think this is we ought to feel about this topic, but i finished it feeling sad and i think its possible to make me finish and feel thougthful
and how something makes you feel is and important factor in the abilty for that idea to spread
