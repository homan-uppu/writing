# PV health

My goal is to design and perfectly execute a health plan for this.

1. Diet.
2. Exercises.
3. Supplements.
4. Fasting done right (get the refeeding to work well).

---

## Diet
- One meal a day (Decide what this will be today. Whatever it is, you absolutely need to stick to it.).
- More fiber. Might need some supplement for this (Triphala).
- Only 1 cup of water based green tea every day. And as many non-caffenated teas. In fact, try to switch over entirely to non-caffenatd teas.

Keep building. Keep creating. Amen.

## Exercises
- Bandhas.
- Kegel routine.
- Pullups for upper back and posture strength.
- Planks.
- Deep kettle bell squats.

## Supplements
- https://www.amazon.in/Organic-India-Pshyllium-Whole-Husk/dp/B0728NQ4W4/ref=sr_1_17?crid=28AEGSW9F41W2&keywords=Psyllium+husk&qid=1706624101&sprefix=psyllium+h%2Caps%2C222&sr=8-17 (husk for fiber).

## Fasting
- Why not just fast every Sunday? Like, the entire day. A 2 day fast every week. (Bec. Sat eve, and then next meal is Mon eve). This would be incredibly beneficial.o

## Notes
- This is definitely a PV dysfunction of sorts.
- I absolutely must add bandhas - esp the abdominal one and ofc the Mula Bandha. Do the research to understand this.
- Need to work on posture. Especially the upper back area. I feel pain and I see a slight slouch. Need to correct this before it gets worse.
- I need to pick up an overall strength training bodyweight routine for general strength and posture. And I need to hit good volume. Great physical health is as important as the mental health workouts in this stage. I'm going to get quite strong, with minimal body fat. Amen.
- Transverse abdominal strength building.
    - Dead bugs. Stomach vacuum (this is equivalent to a bandha).

- Today I'm realizing how much my body is holding my mind back. I absolutely have to commit to clearing out overgrowths and toxins in my body. One meal a day is essential. I have so many early signs of challenges: metabolic syndrome, fungal infection, posture, etc. Now is the time to put the body on the right track. The mental fog gets so bad at times that I wonder how I was ever able to get shit done!?! Incredible. Mastering and regulating the inner system is absolutely necessary in order to gain control over your external life. Amen. I swear, this is the year I shall achieve optimal health (barring any external factors that may hamper progress). I will do everything in my ability to rise.

Today is purely research day. Put together a stellar plan. Amen.
I also see a ton of value in Perplexity but for medicine: combine the wealth of information from Reddit, research papers, Youtube videos, etc. to equip folks with cutting edge research and to help them compare information from multiple expert sources. Amen.

There's something special, and powerful with regards to this. And I think it's super important to have a solid understanding of health. Amen.

And everything can be under one roof. Would be quite interesting. Amen.

And there's a super interesting / valuable interface there - knowledge acquisition interface. Fascinating.

I think this could be very, very interesting. This is something that I'm definitely passionate about. I think the world needs this.

And there's definitely a need for more medical knowledge to the average person. I think it's super, super important. Damn.

A tool to make sense of the truth. That is what I want to build. Amen.
And I want to build it in the most elegant, beautiful, minimal way possible.

Amen.

I really don't want to build anything else. Absolutely.
I want to enable truth seekers to find truth.
The truth is the most important thing in the world.
And I want to enable everyone to find it.

Amen.
