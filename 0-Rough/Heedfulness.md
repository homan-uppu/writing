- Through initiative, heedfulness, restraint, & self-control, the wise would make an island no flood can submerge.
- Knowing this as a true distinction, those wise in heedfulness rejoice in heedfulness, enjoying the range of the noble ones.
- The enlightened, constantly absorbed in jhana, persevering, firm in their effort: they touch Unbinding, the unexcelled rest from the yoke.
- Those with initiative, mindful, clean in action, acting with due consideration, heedful, restrained, living the Dhamma: their glory grows.
