*Get to the essence quickly, directly. No meandering paths. Just get there. Can always add more meandering later if required, but the starting point must absolutely be the core essence. That is all.*

The world is asymmetric: a small percentage of actions account for the majority of results.

Asymmetry is accelerating rapidly and it cannot be stopped because it's a byproduct of human progress. Every single thing we do, whether we build technology, shape culture through art, fight for human rights, makes the world more asymmetric.

The more asymmetric the world becomes, the more counterintuitive it is to act optimally to get what we want because our habits become more outdated. Rapidly.

A leader of a company who believes they have equally great employees will fail. A prospective employee that joins a company with a great team in which there isn't a large difference between the best and the worst will join a company that will quickly perish. A prospective student who joins an institution that claims to have great placements for most of their graduates will receive a terribly outdated education.

This is because as asymmetry rises, the best teams will look more unequal than ever before. The gap between the best performer and the next best performer will be much greater than ever before. Similarly the gap between the 2nd best and the 3rd best will be much greater than the 4th and 5th. You will only see more equality in ability as you tend towards the mediocre.

Therefore someone joining a team that isn't extremely asymmetric are, whether they acknowledge it or not, joining mediocre teams.

The rate of change is accelerating. There will no longer be stagnation of any sort, only accelerated growth or accelerated death. Mediocre teams & companies will become irrelevant shockingly fast. Therefore a slight miscalculation that leads you to joining a mediocre team, or joining an institution that trains you to join mediocre teams, will be more costly than ever before. The type of skill and training that leads to mediocrity does not translate to becoming great at what you do. You will feel a painful crunch if you remain mediocre during this shift. Most of us are mediocre. I certainly am.

The world will increasingly not have any room for the average in any domain. The average will either have to become incredibly good at what they do, or exit. There will be no "middle class" in any domain, i.e. no group of similarly performing individuals, because such groups will not be able to compete with the best who will be much, much better than before, and equality of outcomes will increasingly correspond to equality in ability (i.e mediocrity).

All of us will make great miscalculations in getting what we want because even if we understand the growing asymmetry in the world, we lack the appropriate intuition for it. Our failures will stem from our craving for equality, and our solution comes from turning that craving into fear of equality. Habits are tough to break as they are. Turning a craving into a fear is an even greater challenge for us. Yet, we have no choice.

My purpose is to identify what the optimal path looks like today, how it will change, and develop heuristics to help myself adapt to change. In order to understand what the optimal path looks like, we need to first understand what causes asymmetry and how it's changing.

Asymmetry is a function of complexity. The greater the complexity, the greater the asymmetry.

In games, complexity corresponds to the number of possibilities within the game. A simpler game has fewer possibilities, while a more complex game has many more possibilities.

Most human endeavors can be modeled as a games: "success" is the satiation we feel from getting what we want, and we explore to get what we want by making choices (making "moves" in the game). Therefore we can study asymmetry in simpler games and extrapolate our learnings to the more complex games we play.

Let's take three games: Tic Tac Toe (simple), Chess (medium complexity), Go (high complexity). (If you're not familiar with these games, please read a bit about them before proceeding).

Tic Tac Toe is simpler than Chess because there are less possibilities of the game because there are much fewer board positions you can end up at. Similarly Chess is less complex than Go because there are fewer board positions that are possible in the game, meaning less overall possibilities.

We can observe asymmetry in these games in two ways: 
1. Asymmetry in the moves to make
2. Asymmetry in the outcomes of players

Some moves are obviously better than others, meaning there's a notion of "value" such that the higher the value of a move, the better it is: the more it corresponds with winning (getting what you want).

The greater the asymmetry in moves, the less equal the values of the moves are. In a simple game like Tic Tac Toe, in a competition between two trained players, all moves are valued equally because a draw can always be forced. In a game of Chess (medium complexity), from any given position of the board, there are a range of values for the moves you can make. There are better and worse moves, and there is some difference between the best move and the next best move. In Go, similar to Chess, there are better and worse moves, but the gap between the best move and the next best move is greater than it is in Chess because Go is a more complex game.

Greater asymmetry in moves leads to greater asymmetry of outcomes. We can observe this by seeing the ELO ratings of professionals for these games. "ELO rating" is a way to calculate relative skills of players:

> The difference in the ratings between two players serves as a predictor of the outcome of a match. Two players with equal ratings who play against each other are expected to score an equal number of wins. A player whose rating is 100 points greater than their opponent's is expected to score 64%; if the difference is 200 points, then the expected score for the stronger player is 76%. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system))

It's important to note that the difference in ELO rating doesn't translate linearly to the difference in wins. Someone who is a few hundred ELO rating higher than another will almost certainly win.

In Go, the difference in ELO rating of the top two players is 183 ([https://www.goratings.org/en/](https://www.goratings.org/en/)), whereas in Chess, the difference in ELO rating of the top two Chess players is only 25 ([https://www.chess.com/players](https://www.chess.com/players)).

The gap between the best and the next best is greater in Go than in Chess. Meanwhile there's no need for ELO rating for Tic Tac Toe because every "professional" would draw, meaning everyone's ELO would be zero. Similarly, the gap between the 2nd best and 3rd best is greater the more complex a game is. We observe this in the ELO ratings of professionals in Chess and Go. The more complex the game, the greater the difference in outcome of the nth and the (n+1)th player. 

Asymmetry is not linear. The gap between the best player and the 2nd best player is larger than the gap between the 2nd best player and the 3rd best, and so on. The greater the complexity of the game, the greater the gap between the best and the rest, and the more skewed the curve looks.

Lastly, we should notice that the more complex the game becomes, outcomes (i.e. ELO ratings) become more equal the further you go towards worse players. ***In other words, the more complex the game, the more likely that when two players are equally good it means that they're farther in ability from the best.***
