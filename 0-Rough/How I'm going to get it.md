Optimize for honesty. If it's work that you truly care about, the results will come eventually without you having to directly worry about them.

Trade-off between money and alignment. This is the constant struggle in my mind to figure out.

I do see value in targeting the revenue directly for now, and then falling back onto the more aligned approach mainly because momentum is by far the most important thing: with momentum you can venture into anything and the momentum transfers over.

Momentum begets momentum in any other domain. That's the power that you haven't historically valued.

So, what could that look like? 

Honestly, I don't want to brainstorm them right now because there's a dimension / space / medium that I haven't even wrapped my head around: the visual side.

I think by generating some pictures and scenes using AnimateDiff, and other custom models, I'll be in a position to have a sense for how to contribute to those directions.

So yeah, stick to this current exploration. Make it efficient: with a focus on shipping a short "film": basically a 10s video that communicates something that you want to say (/ show).

And that's it. Once you have this video out, let's sit and analyze the process, what it took to get it out there, and what needs to be done. Amen.

### Some thoughts on the more direct approach
- Very tough to pull a new angle out of my ass, it'll have to be an angle that I've already spent a considerable amount of time and effort on:
	- Note taking / annotation (Re-imagining Xnote).
	- Mobile e-commerce (/ e-commerce in general). - this is generally a tough space to be in, and I'd like to avoid it if possible. But yeah, there are definitely angles here that could be worth pursuing.
	- Internal tooling... -> I'm definitely not cut out for this space. Just the thought of it tenses up my body because of how much I despise that entire field of building and selling. AND: if you're selling to teams, you need at least a cofounder to get it off the ground. Without which you're kind of fucked tbh.
		- Re-imagining this for ChatGPT-first teams is a viable angle. For sure. Or perhaps even expose internal tooling functionality via a Slackbot / MS Teams bot. This could be done, ngl. But I'm not the one.

Look, none of these angles are viable. Selling to teams is a sales motion that I currently can't afford to do. If that's the angle, then I'm going to have to bring on board a cofounder for sure.

The angle that I know will click will be in storytelling. If I'm not going to tell my stories yet, then I'm going to enable creators / builders to tell theirs. It's that simple. Right up my fucking alley, and definitely captivates my subconscious. It's the most lucrative angle for me to apply myself in. I'm convinced. But I have to do it with deep Samadhi and force, otherwise it's not going to pan out. Amen.
