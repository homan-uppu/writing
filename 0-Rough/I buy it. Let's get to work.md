One of the top priorities is finding a compact, neat, open to nature office space close to home and get that set up to use as two way space: work and meditation. This is key.

The second priority is to get writing! Dig into writing. Spend more time writing than anything else. There is no need for the internet unless you are actively designing and building. And I think you're a ways away from that.

It's more important to focus on quantity and momentum than quality at this stage. Focus on putting out good ideas at this stage. Aim for some speed.

I want 2 essays per week to start with. This is a good enough cadence. Eventually, ramp this up to 3 per week once you get the hang of it.
