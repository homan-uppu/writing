I shouldn't leave until I have serious momentum. Taking calls level of momentum (but even then, you can just email / text for the time being).

Yeah, it's really tough to find a legitimate reason to leave before you have crystal clarity. Including on the project / design spec and engineering doc included. That's probably the right point to consider bouncing.

Basically, set up your work for the foreseeable future. And make each moment count.

Root out the weaknesses of the mind. Thrive.
