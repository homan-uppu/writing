I have a great responsibility that I can only fulfill to the best of my ability by training my mind to be more balanced. Mental training is not just for my own peace, but also for what I can contribute to the world, and to those that come after us. I feel it's my responsibility because I've been given certain latent talents and privileges that make me feel guilty if I don't give back to the universe in some way. Absolutely.
