I want to think about the future.
And I want to write.

That's what I "want" to do.
Maybe that's what I ought to lean into.

But, writing without a good business asset is NOT what I want to do because it adds unnecessary pressure on the writing to "monetize".

I want to make art when the outcome of my work doesn't impact my life. I'm far from that state right now.
