This is basically all I want right now.
I don't care about the status.
I don't care about the shiny objects that lose their luster a year after pursuing them.
I'm tired of the fleeting games that have taken so much of my youth.

I just want to express myself in the most authentic way possible.
I just want to create. I want to lose myself in the act of creating, in order to find that which is above me.

The path isn't clear. But the system is.
