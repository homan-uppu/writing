The more days I spend here, the more I'm loving this place. This isolation. This ability to dive into my mind and give my intuitions the space they need to blossom into forms that I can share with others for feedback and critique.

I'm realizing that I'm someone who really needs time. Time to allow things to happen. To give my own mind and self the space they need to express themselves.

I'm telling you. Just lean into it. Do the best work of your life from here. Make it happen.
