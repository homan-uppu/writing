No single group or community seems to be strong. Or rather, the groups that strongly market themselves don't seem to be strong.

An inverse correlation between popularity and quality of the community.

My biggest problem with the Vipassana (SN Goenka style) community is that it seems to have become more about socialization than the practice. And that the practice is not serious. It's rule based. It's about "putting in the hours", vs. making it an essential part of life itself. Its ambitions are significantly curbed: feeling good vs. liberation. It's not necessarily about seeking Truth, but rather about following some predefined instructions so that you can feel a bit better.

I want a complete paradigm shift here.
