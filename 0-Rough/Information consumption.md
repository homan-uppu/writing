*Designing my ideal knowledge consumption experience*.

Only consume content and art that is **meaningful**. How do you measure this? 

What about: content that calms you instead of aggravates you? Content that sharpens, grounds and silences the mind, rather than aggravating it.

**Notes**:
- Distinguish between “current events” and “timeless”. These are two modes of consumption. Understanding current events in any domain (e.g. new product that I ought to study, a war in the middle east, etc.) vs. timeless art and pieces that hit you somewhere deep. Timeless could be of any medium: videos, paintings, films, essays, books, etc. It doesn't have to be fixed to a particular medium.
- Some social proof of the work would be nice. If it's objectively good, it ought to have had some traction when it was released. E.g. if a film comes up in the feed, I'd want a sense of how well it was received when it came out (or even after). For example, Ozu's films weren't crazy famous until later. Similarly, there are many artists and works of art that were appreciated well after they were created. I'd want to see that appreciation.
- If consuming the piece in its entirety requires me to go elsewhere to do so, I want that link easily accessible in my feed itself.
- I'd want to be able to bookmark (or perhaps this is just a "like") the pieces that I liked, enjoyed. Keep a catalog of what I enjoyed, and what I'd want more of.
- I'd want to read a profile of the creator as well. To understand the time and place of their existence - to ground their work in the context of their times.

Not bad. **What else would you want?**

What is AI good at?
- Summarizing
- Tagging (determining which tags apply to a piece of content).
- Translating natural language to a formal language (e.g. let people filter their feed with natural language).
- And in very constrained situations, text generation. Hmm...
