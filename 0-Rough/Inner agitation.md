It's there. I can literally feel it.
The agitation that I became intimately aware of during the self course.
It's right there.
It manifests as a craving to do "something else".
Not a good thing. It's the cause for mental rot.

Don't even let the thought wander places.
Keep it firm where it needs to be through greater Samadhi.

Concentration is about letting go, relaxing and letting the attention rest where you want it to be. That is the way to optimize the mind.

The more you do this, the better you will get, and the more storms you will be able to withstand. Amen.
