Intellectual understanding of asymmetry is not enough to act optimally in an extremely asymmetric world because we lack the appropriate intuitive, emotional response to guide us.

Instead of fearing equality as we should, we crave it. [^1]

And our craving blinds us to reality. The more our beliefs deviate from reality, the more we suffer, as we'll see in the following examples.

...

When a team leader sees that a group of teammates are performing equally well, they celebrate it, whereas they should be fearing it. In a world with extreme asymmetry, equally performing teammates implies the following:
1. *The team is not well leveraged*. They are using outdated technology that is slower to turn their ideas into reality, or they don't know how to apply leverage effectively.
2. *The team consists of average players*. As we saw in our board games, the greater the asymmetry, the greater the difference between the top player and the next best. The difference between players only goes down the more you move towards the worst players. A team of terrible players would all be equally bad. A team of great players would have great differences in ability between them.
3. *The team's activities are not complex as they could be*. This is likely due to them not adapting themselves to an increase in leverage by moving up the complexity hierarchy to doing more complex work. For example: someone continuing to manually summarizing and transcribing notes, or coding simple functions when present technology can do it way more efficiently.
4. *The team leader is terrible at assessing productivity*. As leverage increases, productivity becomes more difficult to measure because the activities become more complex, but also because our craving for equality blinds us to just how differently able individuals are.
5. *The team is not moving fast enough*. Asymmetry manifests more slowly the slower a team executes (i.e. the slower they make their moves).

And it should be noted that there is also asymmetry for how much each factor contributes to the problem - it's not that each of the points above are equally responsible at any given point in time. If I were to pick the most important factor it would be that the team does not consist of great players, because if they were good, they'd be obsessed about increasing their leverage as much as possible, moving as fast as possible, assessing productivity more accurately, and would be paranoid about not letting in average players [^2], 

You might say for the sake of the employees and society, teams shouldn't be obsessed about improving themselves by identifying their internal asymmetries (implying they shouldn't fire low performers). But the fact is that teams that don't organize themselves around asymmetry will find it incredibly difficult to compete. What that ideal organization looks like is a nuanced topic that I'll cover later - but one thing is certain: it looks quite different from how we've been building companies so far. And since asymmetry is growing rapidly, companies that aren't aligned with reality will become irrelevant more quickly than ever before.

Since asymmetry is indirectly a function of leverage, every time we see a bump in leverage (e.g. a more powerful AI model is released), we will notice massive layoffs, as well as much higher compensation and demand for top talent. Many are already feeling this paradox in the world right now: the market seems terrible, yet companies are desperate for great talent and are willing to pay more than ever. This is the asymmetry is manifesting itself.

...

Similarly, a young person who wants to join a great company so that they can become great at their craft should fear companies in which there is great equality between employees. I often hear people coming back from interviews claiming "wow, everyone there seems great at what they do!", and end up joining the company. This was a great heuristic when we had less leverage (meaning the world was less asymmetric and there wasn't as great of a difference between great players), but is incredibly dangerous today.

A prospective employee with the right intuition would be paranoid about understanding whether the company is truly equal internally, or they're just saying they are. Of course, all companies (even the great ones) will claim they are equal internally because it's not culturally acceptable yet to claim that they aren't, but not uncovering the true inequality internally will lead a prospective employee to make incredibly suboptimal decisions.

To be clear, there are many "highly valued" companies on the market that are incredibly equal internally, and therefore are rotting. A company's value is a lagging indicator of their health. Today's rot will manifest in earnings down the line. And so any job hunter that has the right intuition for asymmetry and how the world works should fear being lured in by a company's present value.

...

Similarly a prospective student that wants to join the best learning program, who has the right intuition for asymmetry and how it's changing, should be fearful of any academic program that claims that a high percentage of its graduates are equally competent or have found jobs that pay similarly well. That's a sign that the graduates are average, and / or that they are joining companies that are average. And if you join such a learning program you too will join a company that will become irrelevant soon.

Selectivity is not what matters, it's the outcomes. A highly selective organization that still has equal outcomes is almost certainly a terrible one. A useless organization can still have asymmetric outcomes that make it seem that it's a great institution. They do this by simply bringing together a bunch of ambitious talent together and letting them do their thing. It's important to understand how much the institution is actually impacting the asymmetric outcomes. [^3]


1. *This craving for equality was useful in a world with far less leverage than what we have today. In a world with less leverage and more rigid class divides, it was important for us to fight for equality of opportunity, for fairness. And yet our obsession morphed from fairness to equality everywhere. Our collective culture was shaped by this obsession for equality. We see it everywhere: teachers are praised when all students perform equally well, nations founded on the principle that "all men are created equal", etc. As the world becomes more asymmetric, our delusions become greater and more disconnected from reality. Our culture shapes our intuitions and emotional responses to situations. There are some emotional responses that evolution conditions us with: most of us have an aversion jumping from high places, or running into fire. Others are conditioned by culture. Our fear of of inequality and craving for equality are conditioned by our outdated culture.*
2. *As fast as **possible**. The "possible" is very important. As I'll explore in another essay, the best teams might actually seem to be moving a bit slower than the next best because how much time to spend on thinking vs. acting is also a function of leverage. I believe the more leverage you have, the more time you ought to spend thinking before acting. It's more important to find the right path to take, rather than just moving fast along any path. And finding the better paths takes more thinking time.*
3. *I suspect the only role that most colleges play today is to put a bunch of sharp, ambitious people together. If those individuals were similarly grouped together outside of a college environment, I'm confident we'd still see incredible results, and possibly even much greater results.*








(*Todo: would be good to talk about why we crave equality in the first place, and show the cultural examples that are all outdated as a result.*)
