Intellectual understanding of asymmetry is not enough to act optimally in an extremely asymmetric world because we lack the appropriate intuitive, emotional response to guide us. 

We need to train our minds to be cautious when we believe two things to be equal - no matter what those things are.

Instead of fearing equality as we should, we unfortunately crave it. This craving for equality was useful in a world with far less leverage when inequality was due to unfairness, but is terribly outdated today when inequality is due to greater leverage and fairness.

(*Todo: would be good to talk about why we crave equality in the first place, and show the cultural examples that are all outdated as a result.*)
