That's my fundamental problem right now.

No matter what direction I choose, I can't follow through on it. Which is becoming a big problem.

At the same time, I can't shy away from this challenge - I would be reinforcing a deep Sankhara of giving up too soon.

The only way out that I see is to sit. Just keep sitting until angles come. And even when they come, resist pursuing anything unless you have the power behind the intention.

That's all there is to it.

Think as if you are in jail. That's what this phase is. You are in jail. That's it.

Cut consumption down to 0. Just keep sitting and strengthen the mind. Done.

This is what you have to think hard about. Seriously. It's all about the power of your intention.

Need to have a more clear business angle, else what the hell you be doing?

If you can't maintain basic discipline in life, that's your first starting point right? To have the mental strength to stick to a discipline without any deviation whatsoever. If you can't even do that, what else can you hope to do?

That's such a fundamental aspect of a high quality life. Put together that system for yourself and stick to it. The system ought to produce the results. You just have to worry about the system.
