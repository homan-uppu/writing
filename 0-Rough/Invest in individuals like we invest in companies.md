As we move towards a [winners-take-all](https://jisnu.org/winners) world, we will need an easier way for people to invest money in individuals in exchange for equity in the value they create in the world.

Today, the only way to do this is to invest money in a company, typically a ccorp / LLC (or the equivalent in the country you're in). But, this means that those who will eventually start great companies, who have great potential and talent still have to wait until they start a company to be able to raise money.

In order to sustain themselves until they start something, they generally have to work for another company to make some money as they are eventually able to start their own. This is a massive inefficiency in the system. The world, and the individual, would be better off if they had a means to afford working on what they want to right away, even if their idea isn't at the stage of forming a company just yet.

Some fortunate few receive grants, or funds from friends / family / mentors that enable them to explore how they want to. Yet, there are many highly talented young folks in high school, college, etc. that would be much better off having the finances to explore what they want, how they want to, but are unable to secure that money, and there therefore forced to spend hours a day executing on someone else's vision instead of their own. This lack of freedom to explore what you want is a loss to all of us.

People say universal basic income may solve this predicament, that eventually, we will all have "free" money handed to us to enable us to do what we want. I believe we will need it, but there's no certainty when it will arrive, and thus we wan't quite depend on it / plan for it right now.

Angles:
- Hidden talent, and how investing in individuals opens up a market for scouting.
- Decentralized education. Join a tribe that invests in you and gives you the space and resources to hone a craft. *Education in many domains will look like a startup accelerator*. (this is a big angle. Need to squeeze it).
- Address the cons:
	- Mental health. This amplifies the trend of valuing a human by a number. Many people will feel jealous and envy in extremes that weren't possible before.
	- Need to be very careful about not giving sufficient control to the individual to manage who has equity in their outcomes. Should have means to limit exposure / liability, etc. (e.g. capping returns? I'm not sure what this could look like just yet).
- Individual stories: young entrepreneurs, artists, etc. and how each would "raise money" to fund their learning.

*The angles*
1. **Talent discovery**. Scouts discover dark talent.
2. High quality, **decentralized, education**. Free, top quality education for those with potential. (accelerator style education)
3. **Control**. Greater control over learning (and life) path. No wasted learning. Learn what you want, how you want to. As long as you show that you're going to create value for the world somehow, you're going to be invested in.
