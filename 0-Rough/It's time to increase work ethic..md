It's time. This lull has gone on for long enough. It's time to lean into the grind again. In a ruthless way.

But lean into it with calm, not panic. I want to be grinding super hard, but with the right foundational plan. Focus on creating that first. Amen.

It's going to be ruthless product and engineering brother, with a great idea. There's no other way whatsoever. This is the only path. Take the commitment to grind from here on out. Let's do it.

Write the last month off, it's OK. Don't dwell on the past. Focus on the present moment and simply outcompete yourself from yesterday. Amen.

Aggressively pull yourself out of this lull. Perhaps with intense exercise or whatever else you can muster up. Start pulling longer nights - when you're more productive. And grind all the way until you sleep. This is the only way.

The vision is ambitious - a tool to help people write. That's not easy by any means, but writing well is perhaps the most important skill now.
