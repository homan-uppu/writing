To illustrate how our intuitions fail us, let's study a young person, Joe, in today's world who is looking to build a great life for himself. I'm making a few assumptions about Joe that I believe represent(s/ed) most of us:
1. They want the world to value them and what they bring to the world.
2. They're not yet sure what they're great at, that the world also values (and will continue to value once they become great at it).
3. They want things that require money to have (home, high quality healthcare, entertainment, family, etc.). Therefore they want to make good money.

Joe does not correctly understand asymmetry and how it's changing.

Each blunder Joe makes is costlier than ever before as it compounds more quickly than ever before. The following are blunders that Joe will make which causes him to suffer more than a similarly able person a few years ago.

***1st blunder: what to learn***

Joe will be lured into learning less complex skills that will be quickly outdated as leverage rapidly increases the complexity of the games we play. Instead of building his intuition for solving for peoples' feelings, Joe will learn skills that are more disconnected from feeling.

He will waste too much time learning programming frameworks, design tools, etc. without spending enough time studying the problems people have and how to solve them, or studying what makes people have meaningful experiences and how to provide them.

Joe may also blunder by choosing a career in a slower changing domain: working in a factory, or to be a electrician, etc. because he underestimates the rate at which all domains are becoming faster changing. He fails to see how there is no refuge from rapid change, and instead of embracing it, he blunders by trying to run away from it.

***2nd blunder: how to learn***

Joe's second blunder will be in how he goes about learning what he thinks is useful.

He will be lured in by colleges, bootcamps, etc. that claim that a high percentage of graduates get great job offers upon graduating. They claim "average $100k salary!". Joe will fail to see that the average salary means nothing and that the only things that matter are what the highest outcome is, and the degree of asymmetry in outcomes.

If this learning program does not have massive outliers, it is an outdated learning program given the leverage that exists in the world today, because it means that they are teaching skills that are not complex enough, and therefore will not matter as leverage increases. Or it means that the companies hiring these graduates from this institution are mediocre companies, and will perish soon, leaving Joe with mediocre skills that won't translate to being great.

The ideal learning program in today's world that will best prepare a student for the future will have extremely asymmetric outcomes. Of course, there is a gap between ability and actual outcome: even though the best software engineer who can correctly leverage AI is likely at least 100x more productive than the average today, they will not get paid that much more. But, as the world becomes more fair and people are compensated more accurately, looking at the best outcome will become a more reliable metric to gauge how good a teaching program is.

In addition to joining the wrong institution, Joe will likely take out loans or spend hard earned money to join such institutions. Paying money for education works in a more symmetrical outcomes world. Today, if the education is optimal, it means the outcomes will be quite asymmetrical, and therefore Joe will almost certainly not get the return on his investment. Pay-to-learn is an outdated business model for education in an asymmetric world.

***3rd blunder: choice in team***

Joe will be lured by teams that claim that everyone on the team is great. Given the leverage that exists in the world today, the best team will be far from having equally good members. If they're equally good it means they haven't upgraded their activities to be more complex, or they haven't upgraded their skills to optimally make use of the greater leverage, or they're terrible at assessing true productivity.

Of course even the best teams will also tell the world that everyone on the team is great, because it's not yet culturally acceptable to tell the truth. Joe will blunder again by not realizing that no matter what the team says that it's his responsibility to uncover the truth as it's critical information for his decision. Joe will lack the social engineering skills required to extract this critical information, and will blunder.

There is one exception for when an equally excellent team exists: when each person is doing a different, but similarly complex, activity. For example: a startup with an engineer, designer, and product / sales person. But even in this scenario it's not that they have equal outcomes, it's just more difficult to measure and compare how each is performing relative to the other. You can't find this exception in larger teams because we don't yet have sufficient leverage in the world to have, say, a single engineer running everything. Therefore as soon as you have a team of the same skill, you should certainly notice asymmetry in outcomes if they're a great team.

Joe will also blunder by thinking that a company that is valued highly today is a great company to join without studying whether they are set up for success in a rapidly shifting world. He won't realize that stagnation is an illusion in a rapidly changing world: there is only accelerated growth or accelerated death. Companies valued highly today with mediocre teams will become irrelevant faster than ever before in human history. And also that anyone who is truly great at what they do will leave a mediocre team more quickly than ever before. Highly valued companies that are rotting internally are walking corpses.

***4th blunder: delusional expectations***

Joe was born into an extremely deluded world. Truths about how the world works have become lies as the world changed.

Joe grows up believing there is a middle class waiting for him when he gets a job.

Once Joe understands that a middle class doesn't exist as he wished, he will believe that he will get some sort of universal basic income / welfare scheme that will satisfy his basic needs.

Once Joe realizes that his wants in life will never be fulfilled by any government welfare scheme, he will believe that the only solution is to reverse this rapid rise in asymmetry. 

Joe won't realize that this is not possible without reversing the fundamental nature of all of our minds: we want things, and we crave to get them as quickly as possible - which is the source of the incentives that govern our world.

Joe will not realize that any efforts to overthrow this system will only reinforce it, and therefore will spend precious time on efforts that go against the incentives of our world. Joe will be extremely unhappy as he will likely not succeed in the revolution he craves (unless he somehow manages to destroy all of humanity and everything we've created). He will also not have the skill to create value in the world because he didn't spend time training it, and will not be satisfied with the universal basic income offered to him. Joe will sadly turn towards addictions to provide meaning.

***The world has shifted from rewarding ambition to requiring it.***

Joe will want to escape the rat race to live peacefully in some remote area. Joe will then confront another harsh truth: the ambition required to create value in the world will look tiny compared to the ambition required to leave everything behind. He will realize just how addicted he is to all of the comforts of the modern world, more so than any human that came before him. By the time Joe has understood the game, it's too late.

We don't have to become Joe. We must not.

There has never been a better time in human history to get what we want, including happiness. The world is increasingly become fair, and we each have more knowledge and power at our fingertips than those that came before us. Yet, the path to getting what we want has become more narrow, almost as narrow as a razor's edge. We can walk it if we try.

Fear equality. Fight for fairness. Overcome jealousy. Build compassion. Uncover the hidden, accelerating, asymmetries of the world. When you decide on how to respond, respond harder and faster than you feel you should. Accept that you will be ridiculed, hated even, for acting optimally. Recognize that the world needs you to be more ambitious.

In my next essay I'll share what I think this optimal path looks like and how the path reacts to change in leverage.
