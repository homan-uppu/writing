In the midst of the forest, Kai, 10, pulls Yash, 11, away from a group of kids cheering on two kids fighting. Kai doesn't like fighting and is perplexed how people could enjoy hitting each other.

Yash enjoys the thrill of the fight. He pushes Kai aside and returns.

Kai, on his way back to the village, encounters a strange old man, looking upwards, singing at the trunk of an old tree, while making a beat by hitting his chest. The old man notices Kai, they lock eyes, Kai runs away in fear.

Kai and Yash learn about the history of their tribe. The war that took place a few decades ago. And the peace they've had since. Kai's grandfather was the chieftan who brought the three tribes together under one, mostly peaceful rule.
