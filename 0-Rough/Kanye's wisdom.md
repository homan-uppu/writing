"  It's kind of fun because when this goes online or whatever it is it really matters and it like really doesn't matter. What matters is you know the people who are sparked by it and the people who are like offended by it it doesn't fucking matter fuck you. You know like because it's about motivating the doers and anyone that wants to sit around and talk shit they're doing too much time they're taking too much time talking shit about it instead of getting up off their ass and following their dreams. Because i'm here to follow my dreams you know and help other people follow their dreams and inspire people who are dreamers."

I totally buy this. This is exactly the position that I feel I'm in.

Don't worry about "convincing" anyone of anything. Those that resonate will resonate, those that don't, won't. It's really that simple. Amen.

Don't give a flying fuck. Just put it out there. Get feedback, etc. but yeah.
