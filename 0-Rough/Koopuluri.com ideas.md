TODO:
- Update "About me" - and give people more deets on how to find me (e.g. I sit at Blue bottle on Sundays).
- Replace "koopuluri" with KU. Main page should have my actual name with a bio. -> let's think this through first. Hmm...
- Email capture: store in Firebase so that you can query and shoot out emails with resend.

You don't need the side menu for the titles. Unnecessary.

https://www.varunsrinivasan.com/ -> This is the format I want to be "inspired" by. Absolutely incredible.e

- Solicit feedback directly: embed a video at the bottom of long essays. Talk directly to readers and solicit their feedback. Ask them to DM me on Twitter (for now).
- "Notes" should be annotations on desktop, and should appear "in-line" on mobile.
- Get the right fonts - or perhaps just use the default (system -> i.e. what Kepano uses). (https://stephango.com/understand) -> just copy this style for now. It's totally fine to use to get started. Make it fucking clean. Amen.



I just want a publishing workflow that is simple and straightforward. Absolutely.

And just keep everything on koopuluri.com.

After 7 essays you should be in a good position to expand your "offerings". Trust me, many opportunities and connections will open up if you continue on this path. Amen.

And I absolutely love playing with language to communicate ideas I find important. It's an addicting feeling. Holy crap.
