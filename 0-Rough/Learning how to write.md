Writing is about patience and persistence. This will take time, but I'm confident something great is arising from this process.

Seriously. Every day I sit to write, I uncover more things I need to cover. And it feels like it's never-ending. I question why I can't simply write a short, sweet, essay that covers all the thoughts I have about this. The reason is simple: you are in the process of exploring, and it takes writing this to cover the topic in enough detail to form opinions about it.

I could cut this short by hand waving some things, and I absolutely have to when necessary. For example, I need to end this essay at the point at which I've covered the nature of seeking truth and have shown that it's the most important, and only, skill that exists. The next essay will dive into how to actually improve truth seeking ability (maybe).

**This essay needs to contain some powerful conclusions about seeking truth:**
1. What seeking truth is.
1. Why it is the most important skill.
2. And all the ways it can be improved (fundamentally - at the level of the mind), and how this is far from the mainstream, common perception of what we can do to improve.
3. Luck is not a factor if you can read and understand the words in this essay.
4. And why the bar for seeking truth will rise as AI becomes more powerful, if you want to feel in control of your life.
5. Derive all the skills people talk about from this model of seeking truth.

This makes sense. Don't deviate too much from this for this first essay. Hint at what's coming next at the end, and close it. There is an art of cutting it off that you absolutely must have.
(Even "Only make things that you yourself want" - is part of the next essay, not this one.)
I would like to have a small section just listing all the conclusions from the next essay (that I think are important) up front, just to give a high level sense for what it is, with the note that I will cover them in detail next. Done.

I'm wasting too many cycles thinking about the ordering, etc. before even getting down the core content. Until you finish a draft with all the things you want to say, cutting off branches appropriately, you should not worry or think about the overall ordering. You must trust that you will find a way. You must have faith. Only then will the mind relax enough to be able to do the best in the moment.

I just went through PG's unfortunate controversy back in 2013 re. female founders who aren't hackers. It was sad to see how his character was attacked with fabricated "evidence". What was surprising though was the comment section. Just so, so much negativity. What's up with that? An incredible display of the poisons in our minds - at scale. I can't imagine how even moderately popular creators feel with the world able to throw hate at them all the time.

And an important lesson: when you publish your writing, it is only to connect with, and to get feedback, from other truth seekers. No one else matters. Brush aside the hate (which you will undeniably receive). Simply connect.

I love how PG doesn't use any headings because it forces him to have the best possible transition from one "section" to the next. There is no header to hide behind. When no headers and sub headers exist, any "gap" between one section to the next feels like a gap in the train tracks that needs to be bridged asap.

I'm going to consider stealing this.

Todo: Study how Charles Darwin presented his theories. I'm confident he would have many, many asides (any truth seeker would), and so just see how he organized it at the end, or whether he saved them for future publications.
