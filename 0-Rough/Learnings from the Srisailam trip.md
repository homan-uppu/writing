The intensity of the practice seems to be lost in India. I haven't found any group that has an inkling of the intensity of the Thai forest tradition. Or, if they exist, most of us haven't heard about them.

I'm sure they exist - deep in the mountains of the Himalayas, etc.

The optimal place for the practice is one that I design and construct for myself. In the forested outskirts of a town or city that I will decide in the future. The world is no longer conducive for the forest tradition of asceticism. The forests in India are heavily regulated. Perhaps deep into the Himalayas is the only other place. Everything else has been extremely commercialized. Instead of following the path laid down by the greats, people have devolved to only worshipping them - which is the last thing they would have wanted from people.

The only way "out" of this situation is to plow through.
