My biggest weakness has been getting users. Sales. Marketing. Distribution. Those have been my weak points.

I'm quite confident in getting a stellar product out the door.

I want to master distribution. It's the kind of skill that's useful for getting any product (including films, etc.) to the audience.

You can't run away from this. Seriously.
