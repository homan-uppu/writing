*A single place to grind out of to achieve **escape velocity**. That I shall not budge from whatsoever. Momentum is everything. Continue to pick yourself back up. No retreats, etc. until I achieve financial freedom (i.e. I have 500k USD in my bank account - that is my earnings, not fundraising, etc). Until then, I will only sporadically sit. I will not shy away from my duties.*
### What I want (ideally)
- A **workspace** for my monitor set up and a bookshelf for a set of books that I plan on reading. (Physical books). 
	- Trees outside. 
	- Natural light. 
	- Openable windows (to access outside air when I want).
	- Provision for an air conditioner if required.
- Close to a Gym or Yogasana studio. Force yourself to the right spaces that force you to work on your body.
- Make food at home every single day in the am. Dump ingredients in cooker right before the morning sit, and just take it to work. Get back to the strict OMAD - without any crap food.

- Areas: Gachibowli, Financial District (ideal - since it's closer to home), and open to some parts of Jubilee Hills - but not really.
- I'd **like to have the option** to live in the office as well - for at least a few days a week. Especially when the grind turns up. **That would be ideal.**, but I'm also open to a reasonable commute (30 - 35 mins).
