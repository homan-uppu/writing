The effort that's required is the effort to lose yourself, not to impose yourself.
Let go. Let the creation flow through you.

A painter who keeps trying to achieve the essence of painting. Keeps painting over and over again, but isn't satisfied with what they've created.

Something always feels off...

Yet, they persist.

The effort to be effortless
