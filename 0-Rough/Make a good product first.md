"Everyone tries to make a platform first. This was the greatest failed thesis of the 2010s tech industry. We forget the iPhone launched without an app store. Before you can make a great platform, you must first make a great product.".

Absolutely true.

Notion was just a stellar product. Now a behemoth platform.
ChatGPT was just a stellar AI chat app. And will be a behemoth platform.

Every single platform that has existed, and will exist, will have a foundation in a killer product. That's the only (?) way...
