This AI revolution is going to have some serious impacts over this upcoming 5 - 10 years.

It **would be wise** to take a step back to understand the big picture changes that are taking place. You will need to deeply understand and communicate these changes if you want to maximize the probability of having an outsized impact.

Even if that "step back" takes a year or two. A year of deep thinking, research, sharing and collaborating on big ideas is definitely worthwhile.

Of course, you don't have the financial bandwidth to do so. So you may need to figure out a way to sustain research. I think the most obvious way is to build a narrowly focused, excellent product - in the right way - to generate revenue.

I think that's the right approach because it also grounds your research in reality. By building a product that meaningfully pushes AI to its limits, you'll gain a deeper understanding of the technology that you're going to be analyzing from a broader lens.

In addition to that, you should build the muscle to create value, since you're likely going to be exploring what it takes to create value in this new world. How can you explore that topic without having the experiential understanding of what it takes to create value.

OK, that makes a great deal of sense. That's what I'm going to do.

The important outcome of this thinking is that: I need to be a great observer of the bigger picture changes taking place. And, I need to share my observations with the world. Amen.

A calm mind is what I'll need to see this through. I need to work with zestful ease to maximize my productivity by reducing internal friction. Amen.
