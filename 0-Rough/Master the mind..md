It's going to be just you, your mind, and the internet.
If you want to rise, you must carefully guard your mind. The universe of information will attack it. Amen.

If you don't develop sufficient mastery over the mind during this phase, you're going to be chewed out. You will either greatly benefit or harm your mental health. There is no stagnation. Amen.
