*A theory about the incentives that govern us that explain how we got here and where we are going.*

Every single thing that we do pushes the world towards more transactions.

By "transaction" I mean when one person exchanges something with another person. Some transactions involve money. Many don't (yet). Buying and selling goods, liking or commenting on posts on social media, etc. are all forms of transactions.

Those who transact more, product better things of everything - including the means to subdue other groups.

Communities that have more transactions will engulf groups that don't. Social media platforms. Nations.

We transact far more than those that came before us.

The greatest war, whether people realize (or accept) or not, is the war to maximize transactions. And while it may seem that China is close to the US in this regard, the reality is far from the case. The true difference between US and China will be seen this upcoming decade.

The more transactions we have, the more difficult it becomes to not maximize transactions. The incentives become stronger, and the more difficult it is to swim upstream.

These incentives show what is possible and what is impossible.
- Degrowth is not possible.

We cannot reverse these incentives because they stem from the most fundamental human nature.

I'm grateful we maximize transactions. It is what pushes us to create better things.

- Modern history: agriculture, money, technology
- Why slavery ended. If ending slavery was not good for the market, it would still have continued.
- Why capitalism won.
- Predicting the future
- The social platforms that maximize transactions will win.
- The country that maximizes transactions will win.
- Universal basic income settles at an optimal that maximizes transactions.
- This is a universal set of incentives that governs any group of living creatures that want and want to get what they want as quickly as possible, who's wants can never be fulfilled.
	- Thought experiment: *a group of lizards put on another planet.* will become more intelligent through natural selection.
	- A species more intelligent than we are, or with more time, will maximize transactions better than we do.

- Explaining history and evolution through GDP. These incentives are a "universal truth that governs any group of living beings." We should find this in other parts of the universe with life.
- These are the incentives of a group of organisms in which each organism wants things and wants to get what it wants as quickly as possible. I believe we would see the same incentives in any alien civilization that is at least as intelligent as we are, given enough time - if they too want things and want to get what they want as quickly as possible. They too will become winners take all. To reverse these incentives we would need to reverse the underlying cause. Good luck.
