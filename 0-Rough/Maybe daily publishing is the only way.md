I can't seem to write when it's a longer piece. Which is unfortunate tbh. Is it because there's no clear angle for what to write?

This is why the daily publishing just makes a ton of sense bro. You just have to publish an essay every day. One day, once you've built the muscle, then you can open yourself up to publishing longer pieces.

That's the only angle that I think makes sense. This lack of ability to write is just a bad position to be in unfortunately. Hmm...
