This is the key.

As soon as your mind starts to wander away from the present moment, it brings upon itself a massive burden. You absolutely must avoid that burden by keeping the mind fixed in the present moment.

This phase will be a challenge for you, undeniably. But you MUST see this phase through. One day at a time. One session at a time. One minute at a time. One moment at a time. There is no other way.

And remember: if you can do this phase well, there is nothing that can stop you in life. You will have refined the tools that you need to thrive no matter what you choose to do.

Stick to the path.

Remember the technique.
