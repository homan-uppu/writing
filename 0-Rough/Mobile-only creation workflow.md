1. *Minimal*. Concise. As few words as possible. No fluff.
2. *Rough*. no need to create anything polished. Pictures of drawings instead of crafting in Figma. Front-camera video with background noises instead of something more polished.

First, define the kind of work you will do during this phase so that you can design the workflow for that work. I'm going to solely focus on writing during this phase. I need to train my muscle to translate feelings into words. This is the most important skill that works for any kind of expression.

There is no limit or plan for what I write about. But, whatever piece I start I promise to finish, and publish it, before moving onto the next thing. That is the constraint.

Sooner or later, I will write scripts for the visual medium. I may write a prose version of the script and publish that first. But the point is: when the time is right I will slowly, but surely, make my way to the visual medium.

Progression:
1. Only text. Short / medium length posts to flesh out thinking. No images, diagrams, etc.
2. Add images to writing: pictures of my sketches in notebooks.
3. Rough videos (possibly of me drawing diagrams with a voiceover).
4. Build repository of scripts for more polished videos.

I will only graduate from mobile-only when I have full fledged scripts that require a much more detailed, nuanced execution. By that time I should be collaborating tbh.

Improving my ability to craft and communicate ideas excellently in a simple, minimal manner is the first step. I'm only going to use my phone to do so (this includes pics / videos taken on phone). Nothing else.

There is no timeline. Whenever I feel it's time to graduate is when I'll graduate. But I need a solid script before I touch the computer again.

This phase is to train my ability to generate great ideas. There is no restriction on what the ideas are about. Simply build the muscle to craft great ideas at will. This will require understanding myself and training the mind to make sense of feelings. This will be an invaluable exploration. I'm confident.

Using the phone will force you to be concise. No long form anything: books, videos, etc. You're forced to be as concise as possible. Constraints help.

OK, what is the workflow?

Firstly, I think it makes sense to try and stick to platforms as much as possible. Minimize what you have to "manage".

1. All writing on Twitter and that's it? And longer posts can go in Google docs which you can just link from Twitter. That's not a bad idea.
2. Can convert each Google doc into markdown and render on a clean url. No, I don't like this. It feels... weak for some reason. I need a more minimal approach to all of this. Amen. 

jisnu.org will react-notion render a single Notion page. Which I will update with Google doc links whenever I publish something new. Some of the links will go straight to x.com (anything < 4000 characters). Those that are longer will go to Google doc. Done. This is super fucking simple. Keep it this simple. Amen. There is no notion of "publishing" for now. Done. Double down on the platforms. Use personal site as a router. That is all.

DONE: Using a simple Notion page to manage the router. Each essay will link to a Google doc (or a tweet). And that's it.
