Insane discipline to get to the first draft of a novel.

And he then performs multiple iterations on it by himself - starting with critically analyzing the big picture plot points, outline, etc, and progressively gets more nitpicky: focusing on the delivery rather than whether the point makes sense.

And once he finds that it's reached his bar for good, he gets feedback from his wife. Anything she suggests, he rewrites, but not necessarily directly implementing her feedback because if she found something off something is likely off, but it's the writer's job to determine how to make it better - which might not be aligned with the specific feedback he receives.
