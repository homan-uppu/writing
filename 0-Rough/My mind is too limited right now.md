Wearing cast-off rags —his body lean & lined with veins — absorbed in jhana, alone in the forest: he’s what I call a brahman.

Your old conditioning doesn't want you to work directly on the mind because this is the one thing that supposedly takes you out of the Matrix. And the Matrix does not want to let you go that easily. The collective machine wants to use you for its purposes. It desperately wants to pull you in line. It does this by shaming you for leaving. It calls you a coward. Someone who shirks their responsibilities in this world.

Some individuals have a powerful presence.
When they're in the vicinity, everyone goes silent, as if waiting in anticipation for what this individual is going to share.

No matter how large the crowd, how high the stakes, their voice doesn't tremble, they don't shake. They remain firm. Like a mountain in in the midst of a storm.

I want that kind of presence. I want that stability. I want that strength of the mind.

Don't condition yourself re. what you're going to do afterwards. Approach every situation with an open mind. Play the game moment by moment.

I need to elevate my mind.
I want to make this 3 month "Vassa" (rain retreat) to be a yearly staple.
I want to organize my life to enable this.

---

I'm simply acting based on the inner programming that I can't even see.
This is not the life I want to life.
I want to see and overcome my conditionings.

I'm living life as the world wants me to live, not as I'm supposed to be living.

This life is a byproduct of my inner fears. My fear of not being accepted by the world. My fear of being alone. Of being judged. Of being hated. My craving for status is a byproduct of fear.

So much fear in the depths of my mind. I can't even see most of it. That's how deeply it's poisoned my mind.

My fear determines the thoughts that I have. My inner monologue, the ideas I have, everything is polluted by my fear. Even my love is polluted by my fear.

I can't see clearly. I can't think clearly. I can't speak clearly.
The mind is polluted by fear.
I can't even see the fear most of the time. But I know it exists. Coursing through my veins.

**My mind is polluted**. So many habits that keep me from peace, collectedness, balance.
