The focus on writing is the wrong one. My focus needs to be solely on the practice. Everything else will take care of itself if the underlying practice is strong.

The underlying practice is about awareness. About Satipatthana. At all times. In all postures. To take what is given. To not complain about anything. To eat very little and give the body the time and space to heal itself.

This is the foundation of the practice.

Physically, I must drastically reduce my food intake. Drastically. Strictly one meal a day. No calories outside of the single meal that I consume. This is the way it should be. Absolutely.

The general health itself is missing when you are overweight as you are right now.

For the foreseeable future I'm focused on writing.
I need to be a much sharper thinker, communicator and leader.
Writing is my path to moving forward.

I'll treat it like a job. Keep publishing content no matter how I feel. No matter what new "hot" idea I have on my mind. I'm not going to stop publishing my thoughts. This will continue for the foreseeable future (even when I start to work on some new project full time or whatever).

I'm going to apply all the stubbornness that I can muster.
I'm going to hold on for dear life.
This is all I have to give at the moment.
And I shall give it with all of my heart.
