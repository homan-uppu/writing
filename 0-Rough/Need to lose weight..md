I need to shed about 20 pounds. My current weight is ridiculous. I should not be 195, I need to be more like 175 / 180 (max). That's my healthy weight. That's what I must get to. By the end of the year.

All it takes is discipline. Not much more. You already have the Ashtanga practice. Control the diet, and do mini-workouts through the day (so that the constant sitting doesn't kill the metabolism).

The combination should help.

You could also try a periodic longer fast - that's the surest way to reverse metabolic syndrome. I ought to work up to being able to do that.
