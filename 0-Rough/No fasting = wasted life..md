The periods in which I don't fast in a disciplined way, are completely wasted phases of life.

The brain fog and negative impact on mood kill my ability to do anything meaningful. Perhaps this is due to something unique to my body (perhaps some kind of fungal overgrowth, hypothyroidism, etc.), but life is night and day when fasting vs. not.

Given the body that I have, I have no choice but to adopt a stringent fasting protocol for the rest of my life. Eating more than once a day is literally poisonous to me. Never going to do that again.
