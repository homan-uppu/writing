We are moving towards a world in which no matter how hard you work to become good at something, even if you spend your entire life, you still may not be able to earn a living, unless you've chosen the right thing to be good at.

People say that when AI takes jobs there will be more jobs created. They're right, but what will be created will be much more difficult to be great at in a way that will be required to sustain yourself with it.

"What does asymmetry mean for us?"

Firstly, I think the title is correct. It makes sense to me. That is the essence.

There is no room for average.

The reason: "winner takes all" is rapidly increasing in any domain. The best will increasingly capture all of the value in any domain, leaving no value to create for those that are average at what they do.

"Average" is relative, and it is changing. Assuming the world values what you do, there are likely "x" number of people in the world (out of the billions) that could do what you do better than you. If you're great, this "x" is small, and the more average you are, the greater "x" becomes: there are more people that can do what you do better than you do.

"Better" I simply mean better at making something that people want and will pay for. Of course there are many other meanings of "better", and I'm not implying that money is the end all be all. But it's undeniable that we need a certain amount of money to live the lives we want, and therefore this discussion is about the ability to each such money.

Beyond a certain "x", you will not be able to make a living doing what you do. When this happens, we have the options: 
1. We can become better at what we do to reduce "x".
2. We can change what we do to another activity that is also valued by the world, in which "x" is small enough that we can make a living doing so.
3. We can change what we do to another activity that is not yet valued by the world that we believe will be valued by the world, such that when it is valued, "x" is small and we can make money.

Historically, this "x" was quite high. A factory worker in the industrial age could be replaced by hundreds of millions of people and yet they were able to make some money. In the information age, with computers, internet, etc. this number has fallen, and the pay has increased. There needs to be less people in the entire world that could do what you do better than you can, in order for you to make money, but the money you make will be greater.

This "x" is falling rapidly. There will soon only need to be a handful of people out of the billions in the entire world who are better than you in order for you to not be able to make a living doing what you do. In other words, the bar for how good you need to be in order to sustain yourself is rising sharply.

This is happening because "winner takes all" dynamics are pervading every domain of human activity. The bar for how good you have to be to earn a living is rising whether you're a social media creator, software engineer, writer, animator, or even label-less.






For the first time in human history, the more risky path is actually the less risky one. Joining a startup, or starting a company, is less risky than joining a large company. Having more ambitious ideas is less risky than following the path laid by those that came before us. This was not the case just a few years ago.

The world used to reward ambition; now it requires it.











Human progress increases leverage and distributes it more widely. When a new tool is invented, we gain leverage. When someone gains freedom, they gain leverage because more of their ideas can be turned into reality.


*To be clear, I'm not implying that money is the end all be all. But we can't argue that money is required for us to have the freedom to get what we want, and afford us the opportunity to continue to express ourselves the way we want. We need enough money to lead the lives we want.*

There is one underlying theory: asymmetry is increasing due to human progress. It is a one way street. And explaining why that is the case.

Then there is the "what that means for us" angle that applies the above context to the life of a young individual in our world.

The underlying theory is quite clear. My work now is to find the most powerful, relevant, concise "what it means for us" angle.
