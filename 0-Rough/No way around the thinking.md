I know you're itching to "ship". Calm the horses. You must give yourself the space to think things through really well. There also has to be some organic pull. You can't sustain having to push a boulder up a mountain on your own. Lay the right foundation, feel the organic pull, put together a solid team to amplify the pull. Let the incentives pull you upwards. Follow the stream.

Give yourself the necessary space to lay the foundation. Push hard, but also realize that it may take some time. Learn to balance it.
