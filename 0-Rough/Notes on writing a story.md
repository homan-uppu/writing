- For now, don't worry about making the superficial details consistent (e.g. what year it is, and what weapons they have access to, etc.). Get the essence of the story out. That's all that matters at this stage. The core. The essence. That which you can tell whether the story can stand, or whether it will fall.
- Build the muscle of completing the script before moving onto the next one. It could be absolute garbage. I'm OK with that. Just don't leave it midway through. That's the essence.
- Start with the beats. And only later expand it into scenes. Etc.
