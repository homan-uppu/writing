*A quick rant on why money is important. Why I need to be much better at valuing it. Reasons to make money.*

1. *Money enables vision*. It's still going to take some time for AI to be good enough to translate an idea to reality exactly the way you want to. In fact, we're quite far away from that. Specialists: software engineers, designers, animators, will continue to be in strong demand for a while. You still can't actualize an idea without the help of skilled specialists.
2. *Business teaches about people.* The artist and the business person are similar in their endeavor to understand the human condition: what people want, why they want it, and how their wants change. Selling a product - whatever that may be - teaches invaluable lessons about human nature, as well as the nature of a particular market. There's no better education than selling a product to the world.

It's time for me to be a lot better about managing money. I can't afford to be this stupid or careless about money from here on out. Make sense of the paths to money. Figure out how you want to play this.

So yeah, think deeply about all of this. Be cautious what spaces you enter into. Amen.

There are many, many opportunities here. Be slow in how you enter. But when you enter, go all out. Amen.
