Yeah, I like this organization better than anything else. The latency honestly doesn't matter. I want to type more slowly anyway. And therefore, this doesn't really hurt my ability to express myself in any meaningful way.

On the other hand, the organizational benefits are solid. The folder structure, the ability to link to other pages, etc. is solid. This feels like a tool built for thinking, whereas other text editors feel like tools for coding. And there is a significant difference there.
