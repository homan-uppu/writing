This is tough to make sense of.

I understand that the only pieces that would move the needle are well thought out, well crafted pieces, but at the same time I see great value in having a high publishing cadence initially - in order to build the writing muscle in the first place.

After 120 essays in 120 days, I see myself in a position in which I have the core muscle to create - which is a valuable foundation that will translate to higher craft pieces for sure. Bec. higher effort pieces still start with the same blitz drafts - they just take far more iterations to get right before publishing.

One counter-argument is: the real skill is the quality pieces, and the shorter pieces don't force you to build the skill of quality. Interesting.

I think the right strategy is to not skip the dailies. Make sure you knock it out every single day. But, in addition to that, consider adding a longer, well thought out piece, once a week - on your main site (koopuluri.com) - that feels like the right approach because I need to build the fundamental writing muscle first: to be able to flesh out a thought / idea and publish it.

And then there's the topic of growth. How do you enable this? Well, first, what's the purpose of growth? to connect with like-minded individuals. To build my community online. That would be my primary purpose.

It's not easy to get growth initially. You have to be quite **pro-active** in order to get the results you want with this.

It takes effort: cold emailing people you'd want feedback from, identifying, becoming a part of, and posting in niche communities.

It takes time. Personally, I'd feel much more comfortable approaching others if my piece is high quality and well crafted. That's absolutely true.

And for some reason, I really want it to be on my site. For some reason, not a fan of Substack visuals. I just feel that in the long-run, having **complete visual control over presentation** is an important thing to have. The presentation is as much a part of the voice as the content itself.

At the same time, I need to earn the right to be able to focus on this. I don't have confidence in my ability to create high quality pieces because I don't think I've ever done a good job at this. The lack of confidence in my own ability to deliver is what's stopping me from committing to the longer, more polished pieces. That's the main challenge here.

So yeah, I'm kind of torn here, but logically it's clear that I need to publish small first, to be able to earn the right to publish longer pieces. That makes sense logically, but definitely doesn't make sense to my heart which says focus on quality above all else.

OK yeah, just stick to the daily schedule for now for the next 120 days. When an ambitious thought to write comes up, then evaluate that and determine what to do (whether that's taking a few days off from the dailies to get the longer piece published, or something else).

This makes sense. But, I feel I should also be gunning for high quality in these dailies itself. That feels important to me. Because high quality has the most benefits for me: it means I've learned something new. Just churning out average pieces actually doesn't help me much beyond building the writing muscle.

The other problem with dailies is that I instinctively don't want to make them super polished because then it would run over the day. And I don't want to publish something half-baked, and therefore I'm no longer ambitious in my writing. When output matters more than quality, ambition suffers.

Fascinating. That's a bad outcome. Ambition implies uncertainty. There's an uncertain amount of work ahead to make sure the writing rises to meet the ambition. Without that effort, I'm not sure it's possible.

The writing copilot might not make that much sense because I wouldn't be the user of it... would I? I would, if the feedback is excellent.

But what does "excellent" even mean? That's the other challenge here no?

Today's post: about the promise of bootcamps, and why they've failed to reach their initial ambitions. This is actually a helpful post for me to understand this space better. I def want to write about it.
