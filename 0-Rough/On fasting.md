You're not going to make it if you can't maintain the optimal health for your body.
Your brain fog is certainly rooted in something biological. You haven't had this before. This is something that has come up relatively recently (i.e. 3 - 4 years on and off). AND: you've already overcome it with disciplined OMAD a couple of months ago.

My life was significantly better when I was fasting daily.
My mind operated more smoothly.
My concentration was significantly better, and my practice was better as a result.

I genuinely suspect this brain fog and shiftisng moods is partly attributable to the gut and biology.

In fact, this was the most important shift I had made. Fasting naturally allowed for a much stronger concentration, which could then be utilized for any purpose.

Fasting coupled with Ashtanga was a perfect combination.

I must get back to this.

One of the reasons I want to do the longer retreat is to force myself into deeper fasts and essentially rejuvenate and revitalize the body. 3 months of perfect fasting regiment should work wonders.

I do want to take the ipad to the retreat to use for writing once during the "off" periods (which I will absolutely need as I'm not doing a 3 month continuous meditation retreat).

The best way to straighten the mind is to handle it through the body. And fasting is the most powerful system to reset the body. It needs to be something you sustain though. It can't just be for a few months. You need to sustain it for life.

Alternate day fasting until you hit 80kg. And you should aim to sustain 80kg from then on out (by continuing daily fasting).
