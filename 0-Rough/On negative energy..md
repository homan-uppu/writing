Was talking to a friend today who point blank said that they think humanity will be screwed 100% within a couple of generations due to global warming and the other crises that are happening around the world.

They also work a soul crushing job and hate the capitalistic system that forces them to do so. Yet, they're the ones who want to live in a US city and not come back and live in India even though they can (they're an Indian citizen). To me it just feels like they're blaming the system instead of taking responsibility for their situation.

They want to stay in the west for freedoms, but don't want the capitalistic system (which is precisely what led to those freedoms imo). They say a socialistic European city would be great... like Amsterdam.

I don't think such pessimism about the future and hate towards "the system" helps an individual live a happy, fulfilling life. Especially if they hold onto such feelings strongly, without any chance of letting up.

They talked about starting some kind of revolution because of the rising inequality or something. But, how? Why? Why not work to build financial stability for yourself first? Why not ease the hate, frustration and hopelessness so that you yourself can have a more balanced mind so that you can see things more clearly?

Sometimes I feel like I need to distance myself from such people because I'm incredibly selfish: i can't imagine not being impacted by their negative energy.

This also seems to be the prevailing mindset everywhere I look online (except for Startup Twitter - which is more optimistic about the future). Damn, I do miss engaging with optimists who have a "let's figure this out" attitude rather than folks who can only see how the world will crash and that there's nothing we can do about it.
