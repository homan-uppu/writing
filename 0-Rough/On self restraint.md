Self restraint is how you achieve freedom.
Must focus on concentrating the mind brother. That is the most important thing to do. Concentrate the mind. Tap into deeper states of Samadhi. Jhana. Sila Samadhi Panna. You know how to do it. You just have to commit to it. You just have to do it. Amen.

You just have to do it. There is no other way to break through this. You have no choice but to ramp up your meditation hours. There is nothing else to be done.

Write down the goal.
Meditate and work diligently towards it.
That's all you can do. That's all you must do. Amen.
