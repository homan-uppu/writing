I need to spend as much time there as possible. Come back home for the aft. Go back for late aft. Maximize time there outside of extreme heat.

This is the right strategy. Do not stay at home beyond 5:30pm. It's simply a waste of time. Seriously. Need to be much better about this. GTFO by 5:30pm. Get back to the office and get the grind on until 10pm ish. This is the work ethic that's required. Amen.
