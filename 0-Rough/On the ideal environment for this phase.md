What is it that I need during this phase? Given what I have access to, am I being optimal?

*What I want out of this phase*
1. Mental and physical strength with a deep foundation on the practice, fasting, Ashtanga Yoga, and strength / cardio training. I want a great posture, flexibility, strength, and a mind that cuts like a well tended to blade.
2. Deep clarity on the next phase. Doubling down and obsessively digging into a domain. And I know where my mind is gravitating towards.

*Environment*
- When my mind is settled, and I have a great diet and routine, *there is nothing better than working from home*. Working out of a cafe every day is a hassle. And certainly beyond my budget. I can't afford to spend like this.
- I like having separation from home. After today, I'm certain about it. The thing about living with others is that their problems become my problems. When I hear my Dad discuss how to construct the home, my mind gets dragged into it.

Decided: I'm going to stay in DD Colony at the office space. I might revamp it a bit by buying a nice desk.
