I'm going to increase my volume. Publish one idea per day. Come what may. Improve your ability to translate feelings into ideas. That's it. Publish an idea every single day.

I'm sold on this. I need to build the muscle to share my ideas. Craft your ideas in the open. Be OK with having bad ideas. Be open to changing your idea as you're crafting it - for the world to see. Remove all of your masks, your shields. Strip naked. Be bare for the world to see. Hold nothing back. Be calm. Be emotional. Be yourself.

Publish an idea every day in multiple mediums.
1. Video. The raw video in which I flesh out the idea. This is going to be really messy. Nothing polished at all.
	- Probably edit out all the silences to make it tight.
2. Essay / tweet version.
3. An image to support the essay / tweet.
4. All collected / reflected on jisnu.org - to be able to link to on any social platform.

Hit all the mediums.
Record the roughest video with clear audio.
Sit for min 4 hours before recording.
