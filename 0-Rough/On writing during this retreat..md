absolutely no internet use during the first 100 days - except for absolute necessities (paying rent, groceries, etc.). - and even groceries, plan to only do them once a week. you're going to eat very little from here on out. get used to it.

when will i allow internet use?
- a 30 minute window, once a week on Sat eve - so that you get the next day to utilize it. spend this time **downloading** instead requiring the internet to keep reading it. that is it.
- **absolutely no intent-less consumption** of content. you cannot open up x.com / go to any of the platform homepages. you need a very specific intent: what you want to learn, and why.
- don't change these rules until you enter the "work" phase.

otherwise, grind freely when it's time to write. write without boundaries. allow the mind to go wherever it wants to go, without inhibition, without constraints, without judgement. believe in yourself. trust the process.
