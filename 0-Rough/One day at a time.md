damn, i feel really out of it. i feel somewhat stuck, frustrated, lacking clarity.
well, there is definitely one clarity: that i need to continue to train my mind, and that training my mind is the most important thing that i can do.

Balance the mind.
Master your habits.
Eat in a restrained way.
Keep writing. Each idea you think about, flesh it out thoroughly. Only then allow yourself to move onto the next one. Amen. Ignore competition. Operate from first principles. Do great work. Hold the bar for quality of work extremely high. So high that you struggle to reach it.
