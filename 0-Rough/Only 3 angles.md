I can't see myself working outside of these angles for now:

1. Investing in individuals / decentralized education.
2. Truth seeking AI.
3. Content lens.

2 / 3 could be quite related. 3 requires having an understanding of what content exists.

Each of these will require a long research / design process. The angles aren't going to be clear without putting in a lot of effort. I think it will be necessary to find a cofounder(s) first and then attack it. Amen.
