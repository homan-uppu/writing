For the first time, you're completely unchained by timelines, financials, or any worldly concern. Use this privilege to your advantage. Create something from the heart. From the soul. Put YOU out there.

Lose your self in the process of creating. Amen.

There's actually so, so many possibilities when you merge the arts with AI. AI is a new medium of sorts for expressing the human condition. It is a powerful tool for creating new experiences that touch the heart.

Take things very slowly. Be patient. Protect Sila, keep your practice strong - it is the foundation. Eat less. And lean into this angle. Lose yourself in the design process. Seek Truth.

And, open yourself up to the right kinds of collaboration with other artists.
