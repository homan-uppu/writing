This is the fundamental problem.
When I start to think of a company direction, my mind starts to put myself on that path a few years down the line and is dissatisfied with the results that it finds. This leads to me losing motivation to work on it.

You need to build the muscle to attack quickly. Without lingering on things completely outside of your control.

You need to think less. Act more. And internalize that no external product / direction will give you the fulfillment that you crave. That fulfillment only comes from the practice.

Strong Samadhi helps build the necessary internal silence required to execute. Focus on that.
