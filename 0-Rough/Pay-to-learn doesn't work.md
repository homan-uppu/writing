No guarantees on learning outcomes within a set time period, and the greater importance on having a high quality teacher who is a master of the craft, means that the pay-to-learn model becomes prohibitively expensive to work, let alone scale.

Therefore, all pay-to-learn business models will be relegated to serving the privileged, or to the professional who's earning money and looking to take courses to refine a skill that's professionally relevant. Often their companies will compensate such learning.

This is why massive open online course platforms (MOOCs) failed to transform education in the way it aimed to when it started.

The average student can't justify investing in an online course if it doesn't clearly translate to greater employability. Even a "small" fee such as $20 for a course is unjustifiable when you have no idea how it'll help you land a job.

And especially as the bar for creativity rises, the connection between a course and the ability to be employable / create value by learning the skill is opaque, further increasing the perceived risk of shelling out any money for a course.

On top of this, there are no timeline guarantees in creative domains. You could spend 5 years grinding without much results, or find that you can create value in just a few months. With such unpredictability in outcomes, the average student can't fathom how to justify paying for a learning program.

The completion rates for MOOCs are low because very few will sit through an entire course not knowing how it's going to tangibly improve their chances of landing a job.

People thought that by putting a paywall in front of a course, you'd improve learning outcomes. Sure, maybe. But you ostracize yourself entirely from the billion young people that desperately need a high quality education to thrive in this world.

As the bar for creativity rises, the quality of the teacher becomes more important. Masters of creative skills are those that have clearly created value with the skill: they've made things that people want and have been rewarded by the market as a result.

Their time is incredibly valuable. They wouldn't exchange their time for money in order to teach because they simply can't be compensated enough for their time. They may teach with the intention of helping others, but a system based on individual benevolence doesn't scale. 

At best masters will create content to help others learn in a way that's infinitely scalable: by putting static content (videos, guides, books, etc.), but rarely give personalized feedback to students.

So what you end up with in pay-to-learn teaching institutions is those that teach won't be close to good enough at the skill to effectively train others in it in a way that actually produces a tangible difference in outcomes.

A key learning here is that if a "master" is charging money for their knowledge and personalized feedback, you should be cautious. Either the skill they're teaching is difficult to translate into real world value, or they're not that good.

You'll find the occasional master who's teaching because of a sense of responsibility to give back to the world. In that case you'll often find that they're not focused on the money. But they're extremely particular about who they teach because they need to make sure the student is someone who has the potential to become a master.
