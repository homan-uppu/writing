This personal rolodex will be my most powerful asset. Talent is the greatest moat. Finding, accurately evaluating, and connecting with great talent is the most important skill. And that's what I'm going to get great at. Amen.

Would need a way to quickly save / add to it - ideally like how you can save with are.na / cosmos.

a beautiful interface to search through them. add notes about previous conversations (perhaps even AI summaries of past conversations). categorize: e.g. designers, marketing, writing, filmmaker, etc.

keep it simple and continue to add to it on a regular basis, and make the effort to reach out to people.

oh, i would love for AI to go to their profiles on a regular basis and update me with what they're thinking about and working on. this would be super powerful. when someone  mentions something similar to what i'm working on, i could be alerted, and reach out.

i'm going to really invest in this setup and process because this really is the highest leverage action rn.
