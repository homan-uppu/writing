1. Rent an office space. Create the distance between home and work. This is required.
2. Start the OMAD again. There can be no choice in this matter. This is what keeps you... awake. Alive.
3. Start long distance running + stretching + light weight training every day. This will be helpful. Build the right posture. Get into shape quickly.
4. Get off of caffeine. Get off of all excess dopamine. Let work be the primary source of your dopamine.

It's time to pick yourself back up. Right here. Right now. There is no other way brother. No other way.

Slow and steady brother. Slow and steady. You know the path. Execute it day in and day out with patience and persistence. No backing out of anything. The only way out of it is through it. Amen.
