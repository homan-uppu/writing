*The following is all very rough thinking in this direction. Not yet cohesive. But, this is the direction that I want to contribute towards.*

Our mission is to unshackle the creative geniuses, rebels, original thinkers that are currently burdened by an outdated, legacy, education system.

As AI becomes more powerful, we will see unimaginable breakthroughs by small teams and individuals, who will be younger than ever before.

We believe are many individuals with incredible, nature given, talents who are currently stifled by legacy systems: both institutional and cultural. Our mission is to find them and equip them with the tools and capital so that they may forge their own, unique path. They will light up the world with their brightness.

If we can enable each individual to express their natural talents by following their innate inclinations without being burdened by an oppressive education system that tells them what they need to learn and measures their skill through useless metrics that only deflate confidence instead of inspiring growth, then we will help create a much better world.
