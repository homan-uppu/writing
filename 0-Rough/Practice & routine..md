It's entirely in your hands. You just have to allocate the 6 hours to sitting (eventually). I'm going to start with 3 quality hours. And increase by an hour every week until you hit 6 hours a day - the first thing in the day.

This is what is required. There is no better way to get what you want than to put your mind through such disciplined training.

This is the foundation. This is the starting point.

You can't run away from this challenge (of balancing the practice and worldly endeavors) any longer. You can't put one off for the other. Your mind won't let you fully commit to the inner journey. And the only way to win in the material path is to develop sufficient mastery over the mind. The inner journey is a necessary component of the material journey, but the reverse is not true.

I do see an opportunity to do excellent work right here. Everything is taken care of for me. But I need a much better personal system that will lead to the results (internal, and material) that I want.

It doesn't matter where you are in the world. Whatever inner struggles you're going through here, you will go through absolutely anywhere you are. Therefore you have a massive opportunity in front of you. If you can create a fantastic personal system that enables you to thrive right here, you will have the ability to thrive absolutely anywhere in the world: from the most isolated mountains, to the bustling metropolises, and everything in between. That's a sort of robustness that you're lacking at the moment. You keep craving for a "better" environment to practice. Your heart wants the tranquility of the Himalayas and the comforts and technology of the metros. And you can't afford melding both in the perfect way. So you're torn.

You need to overcome this inner friction. Accept the situation that you're in. There's no way out of this besides creating momentum and using that momentum to rise upwards. There is no more "moving sideways". This is it. This is the launching pad. Accept it fully. Think of this like a jail that you're put in until you achieve the ability to leave. You're stuck here whether you like it or not.

Now that you've accepted this, it's time to think about what I need to be doing. What is my personal system?
- Sila.
- Meditation.
- Fasting: strict one meal a day.
- Ashtanga yoga + strength training + running.

Of these, if you nail the meditation, everything else will settle appropriately. That's the power of getting your mind "right".

What are the outcomes of meditation that I want?
- Much deeper awareness of what's going on inside, via the sensations. Always be aware of sensations.
- Less attachment. Be able to "kill my darlings" without much friction / turmoil. I'm not even seeing many valuable directions because I'm too attached. Kill the attachments.
- Lightness / sharpness: be able to shift the mind the way I want to.
- Less agitation.
- Greater compassion.

I need to work up to spending the first 6 hours every day meditating. 5:30 - 11:30 for now. Maintaining such a practice would absolutely transform my life. There is no doubt in my mind. It would set everything right.

It's literally just a question of will you do it. That's all that it comes down to. The will. The will to act. Amen.

You should have a strong bias towards meditation. You need to lean into sitting instead of wasting your time doing anything else. You need to cut off sub-par information consumption. Most of your information consumption is sub-par mind you. Fix this! **You are what you consume**.
