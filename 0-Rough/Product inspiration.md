### Founder-idea fit
- I should absolutely only work on an idea if the UX plays a big role in adoption. That is my strength and therefore that should be a core differentiation. The fucking product craft.

### Ideas

Productivity oriented:
- **Communication copilot for people that communicate a crap fucking ton**. Less of a way to "teach" writing, more of a massive productivity boost in communication: respond quickly (with the right answer), summarize, etc. (This would be good for sales / marketing teams).
- **An all encompassing internal tooling agent**: with chat as the medium, and the necessary widgets (e.g. graphs, spreadsheets, etc.) appearing IN the chat, as responses, etc.
	- Basically give anyone in the company superpowers: let them fetch the data they need, ask questions on the data, perform actions (e.g. mark an item in the database, issue a refund, etc.).
	- This is actually super fucking clear to get off the ground: i.e. just let the team spin up their endpoints. No need for connectors for v0. But, the ideal is to do what Retool does. That seems to be the smoothest path, but that should come after the v0 launch - just let people do a bit of work, and set it up themselves.

AI infra:
- A toolkit to launch your own "agent" - but this has to come after successfully creating an agent.

Consumer / Prosumer (i.e. some path to business down the line)
- **Expressing what's on your mind through an AI persona** - this is the most powerful, yet trickiest, angle yet. And will likely lead to certain fundamental breakthroughs in how we engage with AI (i.e. new UX paradigms and ways to create value with AI).
	- This is the most promising, yet riskiest path forward. Like, I can't even start a design process because of how fucking difficult it is to even think through this direction. But I have to. I don't have an option here. Need to at least think it through. But you ought to have a purpose for the product. You can't have a design process if you don't know what problem it's solving, or value it's creating.
- **Knowledge library**: i.e. put the best Tech career advice in one beautiful consumption experience. A "library" for the team. A way for teams to share useful knowledge for others to learn from (external links, Youtube videos, etc.). The #study channel in Slack that I've always had.
	- There may not be a team angle here fyi. Be careful with this approach. If you can't 

AI for creation:
- Writing.

Content creation:
(Absolutely no bandwidth for this unless there's a clear path to revenue. Even if you go to India, you're not in the right mental space for this. You need some win and capital under your belt to play with this angle).
- Film
- Videos.
- Writing
If you want, feel free to write scripts and stuff on the side, for scenes, or themes, or seeds of stories. But, now isn't the time for this.

## CUT

- Video creation: e.g. turn a script into a movie. That would be really fucking powerful. No? It absolutely would. It would also be a good "in" into video as a medium. But, angle is too long and uncertain.
- Movie poster creation.

Don't worry about "meaning" and shit for now. You'll find meaning, esp if the big picture in that direction checks out. Amen. Great execution is what you need. Asap.

The execution will start tonight.
