What does it mean to have a productive phone?

1. No consumption apps. No unnecessary apps. 
2. Home Screen empty. Black.
3. Home row: obsidian, google maps, Spotify, WhatsApp. That is all.

Probably should get rid of WhatsApp as well.

This is an experiment to see how productive I can be on the phone. I suspect that the constraints of the phone help with writing: itâ€™s too painful to write something that is too long. It is painful to not keep the words simple (complex words are also tougher to type). Typing on the phone forces economy.

It has the right incentives to promote the kind of writing I want.

Hence this experiment.
