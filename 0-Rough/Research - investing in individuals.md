- [The Legal and Tax Implications of Friend.Tech - Ep. 540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqHYU7TS2Kc)
- https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/15lbzck/when_are_profits_actually_distributed_to/ (How a shareholderâ€™s stock value is related to the actual revenue - are they actually co-owners of the enterprise?).
- Understand what a "company" actually is. Dividend. Shareholder. Equity. Board. How much control each has. The nature of fraud. Regulation that governs a company, and who can invest in it. How to kick out an investor. Etc. Investment terms. SAFE. Preferred stock, etc. Basically all of the terms that a VC / founder would need to understand thoroughly. Recent innovations and why they matter. Lot of important concepts that I have no grasp of.
- Understand the evolution of "company". What were its origins, and why did it evolve the way it did? I think the way it has evolved shows the way it may evolve in the future.
- The arc of crypto: https://danromero.org/crypto-reading/ -> go through these. Understand how we got here. Probably want to read Dixon's new book as well.
