1. Discord as an app platform - to distribute AI apps. That's actually quite powerful. Amen. Put down some quick thoughts on this. It's an angle that I didn't even consider from an internal tooling perspective. Amen.
2. Visual storytelling with AI. Start to build a sense for the underlying technology here (i.e. how diffusion works. How does this translate to video, what it takes to train such a model, etc.e). I think that's where I need to be to start getting a feel. A full-stack filmmaker: all the way from the technology up to the story. The entire stack.
