Last couple of days not that great. Mind is still recovering from eating too much. Feels sluggish and also... down. Give it the space to rise again, to become light again. This process takes time. Guard the mind during this phase. Don't act on any habit that pulls the mind down further.

I also need to clarify my strategy.
