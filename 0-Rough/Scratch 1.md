*Trying to strike the right high level flow without overcomplicating what I'm trying to say. Be as concise as possible. Basically write the tweetstorm right now. That's what you need. The simplest, most concise flow of your argument.*

- Asymmetry exists everywhere in our world and lives, but we suck at seeing it, and we're even worse at utilizing asymmetries to get what we want.
- Our inability to quickly identify asymmetries in the areas that matter to us, holds us back from achieving our potential.
- Examples to show how easy it is to miss seeking asymmetry: a ceo, an employee, a parent re. school for their child. - show these examples up front.

- In order to get most things that we want, we often take many decisions. Each decision has many options.

- We can model everything we do as a game.
- Asymmetry is a function of complexity. The more complex the game, the greater the asymmetry.

Rough:
- We don't have the right intuition to see asymmetry because asymmetry is a relatively recent phenomena, one that our culture and evolution haven't conditioned us to intuitively comprehend. Which is why intellectual understanding only goes so far in enabling us to sniff out asymmetry and take advantage of it to get what we want.

Education ought to be a relentless effort to uncover hidden differences between students and equipping them with what they need to amplify their innate strengths.
