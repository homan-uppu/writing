Need to explain how the college learning methodology fails to train creativity - in the way that matters.

And then the difference between the elite and the average with regards to this instruction quality.

But what actually trains creativity (in the way that matters), is to learn by doing. Theory and practice go hand in hand, with tailored feedback from the best, and in touch with the market.

College instruction is about learning the theory.

Yeah, you've completely avoided this point, but without this you can't make any argument for why it's outdated without talking about what works.

In fact, this is the order:
- College isn't working
- Rising creativity bar
- Consequences of rising creativity bar.
	- Use software engineering as the case study to explain what this shift does.
- Why the average college can't train for this high bar of creativity. - What are the "features" of training in creative domains, and why colleges can't do this at scale.
	- Show what the average college instruction looks like.
	- Bootcamps can't train for this either because economics don't work out.
- Even elite colleges fail to train for this higher creativity bar, but they get away with it because: ___ , and hence they will continue to be relevant.
