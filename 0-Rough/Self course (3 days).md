### Notes
- Anapana = Sharpening the concentration of the mind. Unification of the mind towards a single point.
- Vipassana = Objective observation with Sampajanna: constant thorough understanding of impermanence.
- There is no other way. There is nothing else to be done. There is no backing out. The only way out is through it.
- There is no forcing it. Your job is to not "do" anything. In fact it is to do nothing. It is to simply observe reality as it is. You have no choice in what manifests. All you can do is accept it. Observe it objectively with a balanced mind. Your reactions are the problem. Not reality itself.
- Don't be attached to concentration as well. It will come and go. Everything changes.
