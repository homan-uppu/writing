## Plan

### Course design
1. **31 days**. This is how long it takes to make the practice seep deep into your system. To make the lifestyle a habit. (bec going to meet Gautam. OR: go to Srisailam and find a place there to conduct the self course. So that you can be completely away from family. Family truly can be a burden for those that want to practice seriously. Absolutely). 
2. Need a short period for a little bit of exercise perhaps. This can be done walking on the rooftop for 30 mins or so every day.
3. The timing to go down and fill the water cans. 2 cans should be more than enough on a daily basis.
4. Sweep your room every day.

## Notes

### The skill
Having the ability to do a serious self course wherever you are is an important skill. You don't want to only be able to practice in the "perfect environment" whatever the hell that means. And if you can't even practice in such an environment, you cannot practice anywhere. The mountains and nature are for the serious practitioners who have already achieved a certain level of competence.

You need to prove to yourself whether you have it in you, or whether you just think you want to walk the path. There is a substantial difference.

After this phase, you will have the option of continuing for another 41 days. I give you permission to keep doing this however long you feel like. Perhaps until the end of the year. Only after one successful 41 day course will you have the option of taking a deeper dive (i.e. actually moving to the mountains / near the forest). But, you have to earn it.

### Making the practice an integral part of life.
I want to build my practice in such a way that it becomes a part of my life that I can't shake off. The thought wouldn't even arise. Not walking the path will become as absurd as jumping off of the roof. That is the stage in practice I want to reach.

That being said, there are no "rules" or "goals" like this that you should keep in mind because the path is inherently beyond rules, goals, or the intellect. It is the process of approaching and understanding reality as it is. It is comprehending the Truth. That is all that matters. The path is simply a means to get there. And the notion of the path itself must be discarded on the path. In fact, that is what the path asks for. Absorption and wisdom will lead you to realizing the true nature of everything. Which is nothing. These words that I've just written mean absolutely nothing because they are pointers, not the truth itself. So, seek the intuitive understanding of the Truth.

### Some leeway if required?
I don't know what this will entail, but there will likely be some phases that are incredibly intense. Maybe I will have a couple of days in which I cannot sit the entire day. I'm not sure. Thus, I need some sort of minimum number of hours requirement for the day. Actually, thinking about it in these terms isn't helpful because I'm not "counting" the hours. I'm going to be trying to practice every single moment - no matter what I'm doing. As Ajahn Chah says, you should build the ability to practice in every single posture: walking, sitting, etc.

But yeah, you should have some contingency plan in case things become too much. But the point is this: it's going to become too much! Confronting your inner demons (habits, Sankharas) is the most difficult thing to do. So, of course it's going to be brutally difficult.

But there is no other path. There is nothing more worthwhile you can do. And so thinking about the difficulty isn't productive because there is no way around that difficulty.
