I'm not going to feel guilt over anything. I'm going to take it one moment at a time. I don't care about all the fuckups I've had in the past. The present is all I'm going to attempt to focus on moving forward.

The solution is ridiculously simple: just grind balls to the wall. Fuck all the advice about thinking more about what to do: you do not have that privilege at all. Whatsoever. 

Depending on anything to fulfill you is futile.

The Dhamma is the only refuge in this ocean of misery.

No more complaints.
Make the living room dining table your desk, and simply grind out of there. Come what may.

And absolutely no eating more than once every other day. This will be a challenge, but there is no way around this at the moment. Amen.

Find yourself DURING the momentum. There is no other way to do this.
