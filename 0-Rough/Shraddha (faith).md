This isn't some sort of blind, dogmatic faith, but rather faith that the practice shall create a strong, imperturbable, unfettered, peaceful, mind.

This faith is absolutely required because without it you're not going to be able to put forth the required effort.

And Peter's Thiel's thinking applies here: "you are not a lottery ticket" - i.e. the path is not random and subject to much luck, there is a deterministic path such that if you put in the work, you shall do so.

The practice works - based on your own experiences - and since you know it leads to improvement, you ought to have deep faith in it. The day it doesn't give you results, you can naturally re-asses this. But, I don't think that day will come tbh - I intuitively feel so.
