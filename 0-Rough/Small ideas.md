Starting small to build momentum.
Don't artificially restrict yourself to boundaries.
Create what needs to be created. 
The way it needs to be created.

There are many notions of "small ideas". Don't get sidetracked into thinking there is only one.

Let's start with this: no deviation until launching and growing the curated knowledge consumption to at least 1k users. Get it to that point. Think deeply about what it means to discover and consume knowledge. Think deeply about the right product experience to do so. Or perhaps the starting point isn't even a product.

So many things to think through here. Fascinating.
