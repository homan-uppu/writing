You just have to go to a place with strong determination to see it through.
And then deal with the mind that will work against you for the initial phases.
This is all you can do. There is nothing else to do.

I don't see the point of sitting around here and waiting for something to happen. Nothing is going to happen. If you want the retreat, you have to grab it. You have to be intentional about it. You need to have conviction about it.

You can't be back and forth about it.

But, that being said, I'm not convinced that Srisailam is the ideal place with all of the religious tourism that happens here. But, then where else could you go? It's not like there are many other options.

So, where's the angle? I'm not even sure.

Is there a part of you that doesn't want to do this? If not, why not? Is it because you want to build something? You need to control the itch to build. You need to give the ideas more time to linger and come to fruition. You shouldn't prematurely attack it. If you attack it, do it right, such that you see it all the way through.

**No more half-assing anything.**

The plan is the following. Amen.
