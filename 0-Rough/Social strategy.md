- Update jisnu.org. It will be where any long-form thinking will go, along with my bio. This doesn't really have to happen right now I think... Will see.
- Write your manifesto for this phase - the mistakes you've made in the past that you will not repeat, your obsession with craft and why you're only going to take the artist's path. (Maybe reference Rick Rubin - I really like this guy). Pin this to your X profile. Actually, this manifesto is the first step. Make it extreme. I would rather die on this hill than budge. And I've accepted the possibility that no matter what I create for the rest of my life I might not make money from it, and I'm perfectly OK with that. But what this shift does is it puts me in a default alive state forever. I've adjusted my lifestyle to give me infinite runway (for all intents and purposes). All I want to do is ship great products and that's all I'm going to do.

The ones that love the craft, and the ones that do it because it's just the viable career option. One shines like a bright star, while the other withers away.
