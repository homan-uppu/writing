Embrace solitude. Use it as an opportunity to train your mind.

You're craving that human connection that comes from a deep sense of collaboration. You may or may not ever get that in life (I suspect you will, but nothing is guaranteed).

Even when you collaborate in a team, you'll still go through phases of feeling lonely. Loneliness is a mental habit. A Sankhara. It's not actually as related to people as you think it is.

I've felt lonely in the midst of people many times in my life. Because no group of people will ever fully "get you". The closest I've felt to a group would probably be the serious Vipassana practitioners. I'm incredibly aligned with them. If I could pick a community it would be the community of seekers.

Loneliness stems from that feeling of not being understood by others, not due to lack of conversations, etc. In SF I had many conversations - especially on the basketball court. And yet, somewhere deep inside, I didn't feel understood.

I need to become a lot more comfortable with the feeling of being misunderstood. I need to be OK not being understood by others, and to an extent, not being understood by other parts of myself.

Embrace solitude.
Use solitude as an opportunity to **train the mind**.
Master your mind.

Find the ease, the peace, within yourself. Whether in solitude, or in the midst of millions. Amen.
