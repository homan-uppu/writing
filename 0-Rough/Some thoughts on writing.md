- **Writing may not be the final form for your creation, but I believe it's likely part of the initial expression of it**. Because capturing an idea in words is efficient and lets you explain it with a type of precision you can't in other mediums without spending far more effort. Coupling words with an image or drawing to add more nuance to your idea gives you a powerful seed to start with. Therefore, writing is unavoidable. Or put another way: without taking advantage of writing, you make you task to iterate on the seed more difficult.
- Writing to explore ideas is a great way to **validate** your direction by giving yourself (and the various "you"s inside of you) the time to process and iterate on your thinking to improve it and to hold it to a high standard.
- Writing and iterating on ideas before executing on them lets you be more **ambitious** by letting all parts of you analyze the idea, test it, iterate on it, before spending the great deal of time and effort to execute on it. As we gain greater leverage, it'll be more important to think through how we're going to apply that leverage.
