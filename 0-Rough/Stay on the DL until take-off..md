There can be no way socializing / hanging with friends / nothing that deviates from achieving take off.

What does take off mean? I know how it will feel, but I'm not going to define it in words because I want to give the definition the room to grow and change. There is no set "criteria" at which I will be open to hanging with friends. It will need to be a feeling of some kind of "hammayyaa" that I've made it to some place that is not nothing.

Perhaps I'll never achieve that feeling. I'm not sure. But, that's the criteria. Until then, I'd like to just focus on the natural expression.

Stay here in the Himalayas for as long as possible. Until you absolutely do need better infrastructure to execute in the way that is necessary. But, remember, adding the constraint of not so great internet can actually be a powerful, positive influence on work, if you can utilize it in the right way. And besides, the internet is pretty darn fast if you ask me.
