1. Walk into solitude. It's time to seriously seek truth. No more surface level wisdom.

The primary reason I need to be more serious about the path is that my mind is far too closed off to the possibilities.

And my mind is too weak at the moment to pursue a topic deeply.
It needs to be strengthened.

The only way to strengthen the mind is to submerge it in the Truth. The truth about what is happening within myself.

It will be painful. It will be difficult. But, there is no other way.

Home is far too comfortable. This is not the environment for this.

The mind is agitated. Fickle. Weak. All of my problems lie within the mind.
I need to train it. I need it to cooperate with me, not work against me.

Most importantly, my compromised mind prevents me from seeing. I literally can't see. I'm blinded to the possibilities. I can literally feel my blindness. I know there is something profoundly valuable in seeking the truth within.

Our greatest barriers are the walls we construct in our minds about what is possible. We close ourselves off to profound possibilities as a result to our craving for familiarity and sense of safety. I can feel my barriers that are preventing me from taking the path to remove my barriers.

I'm unwilling to commit to anything because I can sense the futility, the lack of essence, in everything. I more deeply, and honestly, believe that fulfillment comes from within, and nothing outside of me can provide the fulfillment that I so deeply crave. And (un)fortunately I know the technique to find that fulfillment within, thus creating a contradiction: if I know that my happiness lies within AND I know the path to achieve that happiness, why am I not prioritizing that path? Why am I running around all over the place to pass time when I know what the real work is?

Because of my conditioning. And I have a very strong conditioning with regards to this that pulls me into the world. Aggressively.

This mundane lifestyle just isn't going to cut it.
There is a profoundly incredible way to live life. And I'm shunning that life.

My mind is too unbalanced right now to make this decision. But, you will never "feel ready". That feeling itself is an illusion. The right time to act is now, not after some "feeling" arrives. You're not going to have a significantly better mind when that feeling arrives. Your mind will be similarly fickle and weak.

The best way to strengthen it is to take the direct path.

What a life! Damn son.

But, I can't leave on an L. Lol. This is the barrier. But it's a legitimate one. If I can't even achieve something in this, how can I hope to achieve something far more difficult? Damn son.
