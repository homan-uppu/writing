There is a writing path. Stick to it. Write it all out. There's no need to continuously visit the premise in an attempt to shake it up.

You want to shake it up because you're agitated and you're craving for some magic bullet to come and sweep you away. There is no single magic bullet. Just a series of well crafted arrows that are pointed in the right direction. It takes a stupid amount of effort.

You are in the middle of crafting your world view. Don't stop until it's sufficiently complete.

In fact, don't even think about videos until Jan 1, 2025. Just keep writing and publishing until then. That's all you must focus on. Keep the game simple. Keep the medium of expression simple. *Don't overcomplicate.* Don't try to do too many things at once. Don't try to accelerate the timeline. You can't. The timeline exists as it does whether you like it or not.

There is a great deal you can explore and express through writing. You're not constrained in the ways you think you are by it.

Build your repository of thinking. That's the first step. What comes from that is secondary. Just focus on building the foundation of thinking.
