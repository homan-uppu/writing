### Sharing knowledge

What do I want to share when I share knowledge?
1. Who to follow
2. What to consume
3. Big picture (knowledge map: how concepts are related).

Power law is extreme in content: 1% useful, valuable content teaches 99% of what's there to learn about the thing. Ex: When Ilya shared that list of papers (< 20 pieces long), and said if you read all of these you will be at the cutting edge. That's powerful. Such a power law exists for every single skill / domain. A small (< 30 links) list should teach you all there is to know about almost any field.

While the list may be small, keeping it up-to-date is challenging, because the "top n" links to learn about something may change. In fact, it will change more rapidly moving forward because more people create better content, and because techniques that worked in the past may not be relevant any more.

This comes back to the realization that intuition is more important than ever before. Sharing intellectual knowledge is one thing, but sharing the intuition is another ballgame altogether. Consuming information alone will be less and less helpful for mastering a skill. That's the crux.

In addition to the list of what to consume to best learn about something, we need to be able to share intuition (i.e. a model) that can filter incoming information such that the most valuable pieces of information remain - according to what a master feels is valuable. This is incredibly challenging because it cannot be prompted (since we ourselves cannot represent our intuition in words). And yet this intuition is the most valuable piece of the knowledge sharing puzzle. Intuition > static knowledge. Intuition allows the "list" to be updated accurately given a changing world. That's where the value lies.
- E.g. not in Stackoverflow, but in the AI system that continues to update itself automatically. Well, S/O does as well - but relies on people. That's fine. It doesn't matter how the system is updated, as long as it does.

### Create

The only way to meaningfully live in this world is to be able to make things people want. One of the best ways to do so is to make something you yourself want.

If you cannot make something the world wants, the world will cast you aside. Do not expect the collective to continue taking care of you the way you want to be taken care of, if you do not contribute to the collective. That's a foolish expectation that works against the incentives that govern the collective.

We are all incredibly selfish whether we acknowledge it or not. The incentives that dictate what we collectively invest in reflect our true nature: our inherent selfishness. Any systems or features of the system that protect and uphold aspects of society that don't actually benefit us individually will likely not last. (Maximizing transactions is all we want).

### Patience

I have to calm my tits here. Any worthwhile experiment is going to take months. There are no shortcuts - even for making money.

"Quick money" doesn't exist. Everything is a system that benefits from momentum. Everything compounds. The starting phase is the most difficult for anything. Whenever the starting phase seems easy it means that it likely doesn't compound well, making it less valuable of an investment. Only work on things that compound.

And anything that compounds takes time. It requires... patience.

### $

Money doesn't change the equation whatsoever. With more money, I'd basically just work out of fancier cafes, travel the world a bit more, and that's about it. Fundamentally, nothing changes in my life - that's what you need to let sink in your mind.

Even if you optimize directly for money, you need to give it the time and space to mature. Nothing that is worthwhile is quick. Need to internalize this better.

Now is also not the phase in life to optimize for money above ambition. An ambitious endeavor is counterintuitively easier than a non-ambitious one. They both take the same amount of effort - ask any restaurant / cafe owner to see how that's just as (if not more) difficult than building an ambitious technology company. Ambition creates a powerful wave of momentum that you shouldn't underestimate.

### Product explorations

Any product falls into 3 categories:

1. Consume
2. Create
3. Monetize

*1. Consume*:
- Social platforms, feeds, content.

*2. Create*:
- Tools that translate ideas to reality more efficiently.
- Raising money to enable creation.

*3. Monetize*:
- Distribution: get your products to those willing to pay for them.
- Achieving a monetary exchange.

The most powerful way to explore a product is to flesh it out as if you are going to build it. The best way to "see" an idea is to actually see it! A rough sketch with an explanation is incredibly powerful. Turn your mind into the kind of mind that can generate such ideas quickly. And can iterate on them ferociously. Speed actually matters when coming up with ideas. It's a numbers game. To get to the really good ideas / angles / approaches, you need to have the most options to analyze.

### Product directions

*Consume*:
1. A lens for all information you consume. Whatever enters your mind has to go through this "layer" first. What would you want in that layer and why?
	1. Helps you filter, tag, organize, present information the way you want it.
	2. (Imagine fey.com, but for any useful information out there).
2. Content feed. The best feed you can imagine for the topics you care about. How? Don't worry about the how, it's just the fucking best. It encapsulates your intuition for what is good. Perhaps with some constraints / features that make it interesting (e.g. only timeless old content, not following the trends of the day).
3.
