A classroom that acts as a jail for a student who has an urge to create. Something. But can't because they're forced to comply.

We get a sneak peek into their mind. They're dreaming of escaping the monotony. Escaping the dread of being "institutionalized".

A student is being taught to follow the rules. They don't have the space to be themselves.
