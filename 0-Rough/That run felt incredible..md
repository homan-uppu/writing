That's the mileage I want to hit every single day.
Once that becomes relatively easier, add in the sprints.

Keep the diet in tip top condition.

And the Ashtanga is necessary to keep the overall body healthy so that it can recover well for these runs.

This is it brother. Time to reverse all the fat accumulated on my body. It's time to get to the **healthiest shape of my life**. I've let this metabolic disease fester for too long. 

Once I get my body fat down, improve posture and build some muscle, and get to my desired weight (180), **start introducing fasting** (more than just one day per week - which I'm going to do now on Saturdays).

Let's goooooo!!!

Health is wealth.
