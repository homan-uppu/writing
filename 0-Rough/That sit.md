Yes, I just had one of "those" sits - that reminded me of how important sitting is.

Once you get past the chattering, imaginative mind, and have finally managed to reign it in a little, then you see the power that it gives you to achieve what you want.

Samadhi is an essential ingredient to achieving what you want, and you must cultivate it. Sharpen that mind so that it can help you.

My biggest problem right now is that my mind isn't in a good enough space to execute hard. Because of its anxiety, agitation and fear, it's unable to see clearly, and unable to execute.

Putting it on a task, or a goal, is proving to be incredibly difficult. It's simply unable to execute.

Today I finally felt like I was able to get my mind to rest enough to relieve some pressure so that I can see more clearly.

It showed me how much tension I've been carrying in myself for these past few weeks. A debilitating amount of pressure that I've only just started to take off of me.

If I'm going to climb out of this hole, I need to sit more. I need to sit such that I get to the sharpening of my mind. Unless I get to a more collected state of mind, I shouldn't stop my sit because the benefits are exponentially higher with just a linear increase in time.

E.g. 1.5 hour sit is 4x as beneficial as an hour long sit, even though it's only a half hour longer. Assuming you're applying yourself correctly during the sit.

You need greater control over the mind so that you don't get carried away by distractions. And so that when you are executing on something, you're far more effective.

In fact, you should follow this rule: whenever you succumb to a distraction, take the time to sit. It's that simple.

Discernment: And you need to be more aware of when your mind is sharp and collected vs. when it's not. And when it's not, take the time to sharpen it.
