To have absolutely no clue, and importantly, no desire, to know what's happening outside of what you're immediately working on.

This requires pulling the mind back from worldly distractions, and placing it where you want it to be. Without remorse. Without the fear of missing out. Without any feeling that pulls you away from complete absorption with what you're doing.

Train the ability to lose yourself in your work.
It will serve you well.
