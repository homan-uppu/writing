Start with a single short film. I think it will be a very healthy distraction from "products and B2B style" thinking that will help "open" up my mind.

Whatever you choose, commit to seeing through the entire short film script. The entire script along with some slight storyboarding / midjourney images to communicate certain scenes. Don't restrict the themes / the visuals in any way for the first script. First see if you can even come up with something compelling.

In fact, I'm committing to seeing at least this script through before allowing my mind to jump to any other ideas.

This can even be a video essay. I'm thinking that likely floats my boat better than a purely creative, original story.

What will this story be about?
- Thinking you're strong. Realizing how weak you are. And then finding the strength to persist.
- No rules.
- Uncertainty is the only certainty.

Why feeling so off about it? It's just a script. No one's going to watch it! Just for yourself. There's no need to curb your thinking a such an early stage.
