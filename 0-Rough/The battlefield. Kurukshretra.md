In order to do anything of meaning in this world you will have to fight, and fight hard at it.

The more you study something, the more you see how deluded most are about it. It also hints at how deluded you are right now, which will become apparent as you dig even deeper.

The world is incredibly deluded, yet the truth shall prevail.

The way the truth gets into the world is incredibly messy, and painful. We collectively have a negative reaction to it because it challenges what we believe. And we are addicted to our beliefs.

I'm going to be doggedly persistent here. I'm taking all the time I need to flesh out my ideas. I'm going to first focus on improving my ability to think by writing and publishing my writing with the world. This is the first step.

And I will see what comes from that. I will have no presumptions about what the next steps will be.

I'm going to fight. I already see it coming: I will be on the receiving end of a great deal of hate. Anybody that speaks the truth that goes against deeply held beliefs will be faced with a massive negative backlash.

We live in an incredible world. And I finally feel like I can see things clearly. I'm going to push hard, no matter what the opposition is. I'm going to keep walking forward.

The incentives are on my side (i.e. Dhamma is on my side). As long as I study them and walk according to them, I will be doing what I'm meant to do. I will be fulfilling my duty on this planet. Absolutely. Keep walking.
