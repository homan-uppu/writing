The inherent problem with the writing copilot is that it doesn't output something you really care about - that is valuable in and of itself (unless you're writing essays and stuff, but that's such a small portion of the population - and even I'm not thrilled about publishing "writing" on its own)

The tool needs to have an addicting loop. You should be able to iterate on the output of the tool to get closer to what you want created.

**Iteration is addicting.** The first draft isn't. - This is why the Midjourney creation experience is so solid, as soon as you open it up, you're greeted by others' creations, that helps kickstart your creative juices. It circumvents the blank page problem.

99% of fun in the product will be in the iteration.

The **output** should be useful in and of itself.

(Just thinking through some principles here).

I feel things coming together. I'm inching close to an angle to start executing on - ideally tonight. Amen.
