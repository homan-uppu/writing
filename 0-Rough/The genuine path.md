I'm feeling this is it.
Study the internal Truth.
Write voraciously.
Build intuition for ideas.
Master your craft.
Take the time you need. Be incredibly patient. Be prepared for the long haul.

Completely disconnect yourself from social media for now.
When you find the "ramp", get back on social media only from a communication standpoint (i.e. reach out to specific people. Post regular updates, etc.). There is no need to be "up-to-date" at all. Go direct to the truth. That is all you'll need.

This system is my genuine path. Whatever comes from it.
Don't optimize. Focus on the pure artistry. Build the genuine path.
It's time to dig deep internally.

----

Turn off the phone.
Pull out the internet cable. (and ofc don't turn on wifi).
Do nothing but write. There is no need to reference external content because you ought to be focusing on the bigger picture.

Catch yourself when you are craving for status or money. The craving is not going to get it for you. Just focus on your work. Let the work flow through you. And eliminate absolutely everything that isn't going to help. Amen.

There is actually no need for the internet at all except for publishing (and generating the images for publishing - either Midjourney +/ Figma). Have a process for publishing and be extra mindful the days that you publish - such that you don't get sidetracked at all.
