Writing well is the most fundamental skill required to thrive in this world. I want to build the tools, communities and systems that enable this. At scale. This will be my life's work.

If someone can write effectively and communicate how they feel about something, then I have no concern over their ability to thrive in this world. That is the single differentiating factor. By far I would say.

Writing well is a force multiplier for anything you're trying to do: making films, building products, leading teams, etc. Whatever the goal may be, communication is the glue that binds teams together to be able to achieve great things.

And over time, I want to make individuals smarter. The intelligence copilot. The system that people can use to learn all the skills they need to thrive in this world. Amen.

### The path
1. **Writing**. I want to express my ideas about the world. Just express them. I want to write essays. That's going to be my primary means of expressing myself during this phase. This writing process ought to eventually evolve to building a communication copilot - that's what I want to aim for. Amen.
2. **Communication copilot** - with a clear plan to make money in the short-term while executing towards a much larger, broader vision.

This is it. Quite clear. Just double down on the process. And don't burn extra money. Be frugal because it's not clear how long this process will take.
