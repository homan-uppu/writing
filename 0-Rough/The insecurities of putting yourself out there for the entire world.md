I'm beginning to understand why I'm so hesitant about making videos with me as the center. It's daunting because I know a part of my mind will start to obsess over how others will perceive me. I want that part to be weaker before I get started. But, here's the thing: the way you weaken that part is by starting and working with that feeling through the practice.

You shouldn't let that prevent you from getting started if video truly is the right medium for you to express what you want to express.
