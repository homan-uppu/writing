And it's an incredible feeling.
I can totally see myself getting lost in this process of bringing clarity to my own ideas.
This is such an important skill dammit.

It's time to lean fully into this.
Lean into the process of crafting ideas.
Lean into the process of thinking clearly.
Lean into the process of communicating what you're thinking to the world.
Hone the craft.
Master it.
