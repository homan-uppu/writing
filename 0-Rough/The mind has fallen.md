It's incredible how low the mind can sink to.
I haven't felt this low in a long time. I can't let this feeling deter me from what I set out to do.

Habits pick it back up.

- No caffeine in the evenings.
- Strict OMAD (and minimally eat during the one meal) - this is the most important factor.
- Sit for 4 hours today. Train absorption. Regulating attention is critically important. You want to ease the mind and keep it where you want to be. Amen.
