Training the mind for peace is the highest purpose.
Because it will take care of serving others.

Going to one meal a day has completely changed the practice.
As if a thick cloth clouding my ability to perceive sensations has been lifted.

Following the path. Sticking to Sila. Everything has become easier by an order of magnitude.

Everything is clear.
Once you understand the process of unbinding, you can't help but make it the top priority. Everything else feels... stupid / ignorant.

The path is just laying itself.
You just have to walk it.
And that too, you're not walking it, you're simply witnessing the walking happening. On its own.

More than a meal is pure poison. Wow.
I can't believe Buddha didn't add that to the 5 precepts. Maybe because it's too conditional: i.e. if you're plowing the fields all day, you prob need 2 meals or something. And if the precept lacks simplicity, it won't stick.
Which is the only reason I can think of for why he left this one out.

This is such a long path. Keep walking it.

Kaalam agamaye. Wait for it. Don't reach.
