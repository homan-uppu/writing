This sort of organized writing is taxing. But perhaps it's the necessary process to uncover truths about the world that you didn't know.

**There's another kind of writing**: in which you dump your intuition on paper, refine / edit slightly and publish. These will tend to be shorter, but it's not clear if they'll be less valuable. I need to experiment with more ways of writing and publishing pieces.

So yeah, for the next essay, try one that flows better.

Nah, fuck that. It needs to be **good**! Quality is all that matters. But yes, would be nice to find greater flow and feel less like I'm climbing up a mountain.
