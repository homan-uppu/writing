The only worthwhile mastery is the mastery over your own mind. Can you understand it at its depth? Can you effectively use it to create what you want internally and externally?

You can't compare yourself or your path with anyone else's. That makes absolutely no sense in the grand scheme of things. Absolutely not.

Life is a single player game. Do the best with the mind and circumstances you're dealt with. That's all you can do. Leggo!
