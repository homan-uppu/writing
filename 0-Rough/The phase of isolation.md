Embrace the isolation. You're not going to get around it.
You don't need the collaboration you think you need when you are great at studying the truths of the world.

Let Truth be your collaborator. Surrender to it.
Have no expectations for the timeline.

Remember the bigger picture. Rise above mundanity.
