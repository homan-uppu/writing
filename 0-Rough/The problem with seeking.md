The Dhamma is quite clear about this: nothing in the external world will give you lasting peace. Nothing can be relied on to last. Everything is extremely temporary, as is life.

The problem with this problem seeking is that no problem / solution / company angle will ever feel like "it's the one", because it is absolutely impossible for any to feel like that.

Hence, there is no "perfect" project or angle whatsoever. You must simply execute. That is all.
