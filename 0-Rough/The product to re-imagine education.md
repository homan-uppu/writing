It starts with allowing young folks to "raise money" to pursue what they care about. They pitch the direction they want to work on (a memo / video), and they allow others to "invest" in them through the purchase of their token (which is under the creator's control). 

We have to vet the individuals that come on board and have ways to protect against fraud.

Think along the lines of social networks, platforms where people come to transact with each other in some way. There is a lot of value in such places.

Pitch yourself. Raise money to pursue what you want. 

Or: start a new kind of "accelerator" / training program that you get paid to join, and the program gets equity in your token.
