Worry is also transient.
When the mind is in a state of worrying, it becomes timid, and less bold / ambitious.
I need to be much better at spotting the worry, and when I deduce that I'm in a state of worry, to back off from thinking and focus on the practice: i.e. becoming aware of what I'm feeling - the source of the worry - and build equanimity towards it.
Once I've allows the worry to pass, then get back to the work.
