Aim to think through the biggest problems you can possibly think through. Don't settle for anything less. Don't assume you are good at what you do. Approach everything with deep humility.

Focus on increasing ambition. And you already know how to do this: balance the mind. Tackle the biggest problem you possibly can. Absolutely.
