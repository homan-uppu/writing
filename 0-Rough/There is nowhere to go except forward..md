I can't get myself to "take a break". I don't feel like I've earned it. Alright then mofo, let's go and earn that fucking retreat. Going to peace out from the world like a boss... on my terms.

What is the path in front of me?
1. Serious, rigorous, disciplined fasting as my foundation.
2. Build the body up: excellent posture, daily, intense, workouts.
3. Meditation: there is no other place to practice except right here. You can't run away from your own mind.
