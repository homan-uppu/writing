Themes. Ideas. That I'd want to manifest into reality.

**The world is a reflection of your mind**.
- Like the young Korra episode in the spirit realm. That was incredible. Clear lesson: the world is a reflection of your mind.

**Fear saps imagination, clouds judgement. Our greatest battle is within our own minds.**
- Quote something from the Bhagavad Gita here, that represents this inner battle. Or, you could even just quote Trivikram's dialogues (which were so good).

**Death of everything he ever loved. Turned him into a slayer.**
- Funeral pyre.
- Flames visible in the reflection of his red eyes flickering between rage and despair.
- Flashbacks to playing at home with his family. His dog. A loving, dreamlike scenario. Cuts abruptly to his eyes again, this time going into rage, with furrowed eyebrows.
- Right after the fight scene (no fight scene is shown), he's walking, limping, towards the camera, with 3 dead bodies laying behind him.
- Monsters create monsters. A vicious cycle.

**You are your worst enemy.**
- This ought to be similar to that Lebron Nike anime ad thing - so well made. Incredible.
- A visual fight between you and yourself.

**The world puts you in a box. Escape.**
- A person ripping off their face which comes off as a mask that looks happy-frightened. Happy "seeming", but as the camera zooms into the face, you can tell the happiness is a tense, frightened one.
- The scene is in a cubicle farm. When the mask comes off, 
	
**Are you what you think you are?**
- Our "real" personas are also just made up to make others like us, to satisfy our deep craving to belong.
- Who would we be without the millions of societal impressions on us?

**Chitta Vritti Nirodha**
- A struggling meditating person. Face clearly tensed.
- At an instant (to a beat + camera jump zooming in - on the beat, with a white line flash behind the head, upwards to the sky), the face is in peace.

**The mind is a storm**
- Showing the realities of the ups and downs of life, of the mind.

**Friendship**.

**How will you spend your time?**
- On one hand: a warm, sunny environment with loved ones.
- On the other hand: a dark "man-cave" mess: junk food, porn, beer, obesity, once again a face in fear.

**Each impression adds up**
- A similar sort of zooming into the face that looks "wired" - with constant dopamine hits. Each hit comes up as a notification, and simultaneously, you see "flash" in the brain - signaling the dopamine pathways firing.
- Each subsequent hit, this person becomes more and more wired. Until they're back into that "over-excited panic" state of mind.

**Fight back. Thousand shivers.**
- Alleyway fight. Destroy one opponent, and the rest shiver and leave you alone.
- The real value of fighting is to send a message.
