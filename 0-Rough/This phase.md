### Financial liberation
I'm no longer willing to be poor. Streamline creating value in the world. Make it happen. Come what may.

I'm going to be patient though. I know that the outcomes take time to generate. Give it some time.

### People
I'm no longer going to sit in the shadows, in the caves. I'm going to be deeply engaging with people. My contributions will come through people. I'm not going to aim for some "individual genius". When you go the solo path, you fail to take advantage of a valuable strength.
