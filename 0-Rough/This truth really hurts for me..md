I now feel how Thiel, PG, Sama, Elon, etc. feel. It must be absolutely terrible to be in their shoes and just be constantly misunderstood. Lol.

Stay the hell away from friends. All of them. No more sharing ideas with any friends whatsoever. Build compassion and do a clean cut with honesty, doing your best not to harm. Actually, just be silent. *Do what Matt Iverson did deftly at our conversation at the restaurant*. He was really good at not engaging in conversations he felt weren't important, while not being rude in any way. I must train that skill. Noble speech. The most important skill to keep the mind focused and balanced. I have a lot, a LOT of work to do on this skill. This is perhaps the most important skill that I'm sorely lacking.
