Training the mind is critical especially when you're trying to serve others.
The most selfish action (taking care of yourself) is actually also the most helpful for those around you.

Instead of tossing your suffering onto others, you handle it within yourself and don't add to the suffering of others.

Some people simply don't have the tools to build a healthy mind. And what baffles me is that they don't make building a good mind the top priority of their lives - especially during the phases when it torments them. I mean, shouldn't it be abundantly obvious what the top priority should be?

But that's the thing. If an advanced human being observed me, they'd say the same exact thing! They would look at my with pity given the way I live life. They would understand that it's because I'm not yet intimately aware of my suffering, because if I were, I would have no choice but to make ending my suffering my top priority.

That is the reason: we don't actually see the degree of our suffering. And we fail to imagine a possibility in which we don't have to suffer.

I'm going to work very hard to overcome my suffering.
I'm going to prioritize myself. I can't "be there" for other people who are suffering without first taking care of my own suffering. I'm going to be unapologetically selfish in caring for myself and my own wellbeing above anything else in this world.

Dukkha. Dukkha. Dukkha.

Pervades everything that humans do. It follow us like a shadow... and sadly the sun never seems to set. We are tormented by our untrained minds.

Training the mind to be able to realize the Truth and bask in the wisdom that arises as a byproduct - is the most important human endeavor. Nothing else is as important. Nothing else is as fruitful.

I'm going to be far more careful about who I spend time with.
P is not the kind of person I want to expose myself to.
Parents I have no choice because they are parents.
I'm going to cut off all other relationships in life. They do not possess the kindsd of minds that I want to learn from.

I'm going to walk the path of solitude until I find those who are similarly oriented as I am, with a similar (or more) seriousness. Mind you, I haven't even taken a step on the path. But, I do feel the seriousness. I don't want to associate with people who treat the practice as some sort of means to socialize and "relax". Most people on the path are of this type. It does not matter whether they happen to be wearing robes, living in monasteries or regularly attending retreats. None of that matters because deep down they're doing it for the fleeting pleasures. The socialization. For the garbage that surrounds the practice.

Even my parents aren't serious. I acknowledge that. And that's why after passing my own tests (at home), I'm going to give myself the option to live on my own. Completely disconnected from the world - except for my reliance on the community for the basic infrastructure required to practice. This is actually an important point. You can never rid yourself from society entirely. You will depend on others for something or the other. And that dependence is actually useful and important. Minimal dependence (not emotional or mental, but merely at the external level to survive) helps you practice renunciation of your ego. You don't own anything. You can only practice because someone else is helping you out. And, you give others the opportunity to practice their generosity. It's a symbiotic, mutually beneficial relationship: that between the Sangha and the lay community.

OK, coming back to the main point here: don't get involved with unhappy, mentally unstable people who DO NOT prioritize their mind above all else. Who do not have the tools to manage their minds. These people are incredibly dangerous to be around. They will your mind down along with them. I wish them the best. I genuinely do. I wish them peace and happiness... but from a safe distance. There is no point sacrificing my own mental peace to "help" someone when in reality you can't help anyone. Each has to pull their own mind up. No one else can do it for them. Amen.
