This has gone on for too long. I'm 20 lbs heavier than I'm supposed to be. It's time to fix this.

I'm going to get my body fat down to 15% by the end of the year.

It's time to get on a serious diet. The one meal a day isn't enough if you're only doing Yoga as your primary workout.

You should do Yoga in the evenings, but also introduce another workout in the am / afternoon. Perhaps even a run every morning with the usual pushups routine.

How aggressively should we do it and what's the line of attack? Let's figure this out now. Amen.
