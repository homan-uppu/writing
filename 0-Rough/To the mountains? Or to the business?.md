I'm not ready to go to the mountains.
I want a workspace here such that I can build the practice as I ease into what I'll be doing next. I need the action in both spheres during this phase. I'm not going to quit this battle midway or pause it in any way. I'm just going to go straight through.

I shall invest deeply in the practice, as I grind. This is what I must build first before I'm ready to take a more serious plunge. I can't see any other way. The daily practice is critical.
