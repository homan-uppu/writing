I just read "The best have intuition", and it's not bad at all. The intro is concise and solid.

I have the capacity to write really well. I just have to nurture it. Keep at it. Don't give up. You got this. Keep crafting the words. Keep publishing. When the time is right, you will reach out to the world.

Be patient.
