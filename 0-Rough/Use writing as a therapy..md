Don't have any external motivations whatsoever.
Lean into the practice and writing as a form of therapy. To make sense of, and organize, your thinking.
Unless you're in deep practice, you're going to think.
If you're going to think, writing helps!

Don't overthink it.
Write. Sit.
And, if you feel the need to build on top of something you wrote about, then great! That's what you will naturally do. Don't force anything. Let it happen.

That's the crux of it all: don't force it. Just let it happen.
