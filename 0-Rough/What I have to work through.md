1. **Society's conditioning**. It's so obvious how conditioned I am. That I let myself become. By the world. I'm not living my life. I'm literally living the life that others have designed for me. This is so abundantly obvious to me in this moment. Wow.
2. **This life's traumas.** Childhood traumas I've picked up through my ignorance. My feeling of aloneness. Of isolation.
3. Countless previous lives' traumas.
4. Evolutionary trauma and conditioning (that most of us have): various fears. E.g. fear of water, heights, craving to reproduce, the craving to survive, to be (Bhava).
