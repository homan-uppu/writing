The truth. That's all.
I will adapt according to it. I will do all that is necessary to be in line with it.

Nothing else matters, or even comes close to this.

Your cravings to travel the world, live in different Asian countries, etc. are inferior than your quest for the truth, and should be entirely, utterly, discarded.

There's no point holding onto all of these wants that have no meaningful impact on your wellbeing (and you already know they don't!).

So, bring the mind to the task at hand. Stick with it. Don't be deviated, there's absolutely no need to be.

With clarity, see through the distractions.

And if you find that it's still difficult to rest your mind where you want it to be, then simply sit again.

This is the formula, the algorithm to follow.

Do this, and you will slowly, but surely, master your mind.

And master the mind you must, my friend. Master the mind you must.

All external desires are rooted in ignorance. When peace is found within, what work do you have to do outside of yourself in order to gain peace. As you gain peace, naturally you'll want to do work for the world. But focus first on your peace, and the rest will naturally, automatically, follow.
