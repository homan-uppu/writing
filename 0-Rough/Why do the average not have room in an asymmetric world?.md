Why do the average not have room in an asymmetric world?

Greater asymmetry means that those that are great at what they do will account for most of the productivity within teams, and the greatest teams will account for most of the productivity in the world - in any domain.

As asymmetry increases:

1. As a few become increasingly responsible for the majority of the productivity of a team, and everyone but the few will be let go.
2. The individuals that remain within a team will increasingly do work that looks different from what anyone else in their team is doing. The more similar their activities are, the more true it will be that a few will be much better than the others, which reduces the need for the others.
3. Teams will more aggressively need to search for the best talent because best will be much more valuable than ever before.
4. Teams will be able to more easily, quickly let go of the average because the average contribute less to the productivity of the team - letting them go rocks the boat less.

As leverage increases, average teams will become irrelevant much more quickly than ever before. Teams too will have no choice but to become great or perish, just as individuals within those teams.

The standards that determine what is "great" will also sharply increase in proportion to leverage. And it will become more difficult to remain great as the world changes more rapidly.
