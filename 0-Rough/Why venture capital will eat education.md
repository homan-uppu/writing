Artificial intelligence is rapidly pushing us to be more creative by doing the grunt work for us. As all of our work becomes more creative, outcomes will be skewed: most results will increasingly be captured by a small set of top performers. In such a world, the traditional business model of education: paying money up front in exchange for an education and degree, no longer works because most graduates won't be good enough as they won't be one of the best at what they do (by definition). The only business model that works in a highly creative world is venture capital: giving promising individuals capital in exchange for equity in their future outcomes.

## AI makes us more creative.

Artificial intelligence is fundamentally changing how we create value, making it easier than ever to translate ideas into reality. This technological shift promises a creative renaissance, but will also amplify an uncomfortable truth: in domains where technology enables fast creation and distribution, the majority of the rewards increasingly flow to a small subset of top performers. 

This dynamic poses a particular challenge for higher education, which has historically promised broad-based economic mobility. As our economy becomes more creative and technology-enabled, we must confront a difficult question: will traditional education remain a reliable path to prosperity, or are we heading towards a future where most graduates face diminishing returns on their educational investment?

In the age of intelligence, creating things will require less time, people and capital than ever before, leading to a creative explosion. But, creative economies have winners-take-all outcomes: the few best capture most of the returns, leaving little for the average. 

As our economy requires us to become more creative, the returns on paying for education will be bleak for most students. 

This sort of inequality is a natural byproduct of technological advancement: as it becomes easier to translate our ideas into reality, the gap between the best and the rest widens. Small differences in ability translate to larger differences in outcomes - proportional the leverage that technology provides.

(show a good example with software engineers).

The current business model of education is an exchange of money - often in the tens of not hundreds of thousands of dollars - for a degree (and perhaps some training) that makes it easier to get employed. For the past few decades this exchange made sense to most students: if you study something that the world needed, especially science & engineering, did reasonably well in college, you could reliably get a job in the market and eventually recoup your investment in your education.

As our economy becomes more creative, most graduates won't be able to recoup their investment because the power distribution of outcomes becomes too extreme.

- Why does technological advancement require us to be more creative?
- core chain of logic: **Technology → Easier creation → Winner-take-all dynamics → Poor education ROI**.

---

Yet, the more creative all of us become, the more unequal the world becomes, leading to more pronounced winner-takes-all outcomes in everything that we do.

As the creator economy becomes the global economy, we'll see the power law distribution of outcomes everywhere. And wherever there's a power law, we'll find venture capital because exchanging capital for equity in outcomes is the best business model when one winner more than makes up for all of the losers.

One area that's ripe for disruption is education.

Today, the majority of high schoolers in the US still consider college as the natural next step. The social contract is clear: find a way to graduate college with good enough grades, and you'll be able to get a job and build a meaningful career, while recouping your investment over time.

But, as the world becomes more creative, paying money in exchange for an education and a degree so that you can get employed won't work because increasingly the average student won't be able to land a job because the best capture most of the value, leaving little left to the average.

This isn't a new paradigm. We're already seeing this play out in the creator economy. There is no creator middle class. It's incredibly difficult for most creators to make a living creating. They have to supplement their creative efforts with more "regular" jobs to make ends meet. This is why art education is mostly a path for the privileged, and not something that most rational individuals would take out a loan to invest in.

But what happens when the "regular" jobs also become creative? If it's not that creative, AI can do it. If it is creative, it will have the same power law distribution of outcomes any creative economy, leading to the same challenges that creators already face. What if there are no more "regular" jobs to sustain your creative efforts, and that there are only creative options available to contribute to the economy?

## Acceleration of an existing trend
- Inequality is already growing. AI will accelerate it.

## VC funded learning

## A new financial instrument

We don't yet have the tools to deal with this future.

We're missing a core financial instrument that would enable venture capital to eat the world: **the ability to invest in individuals in exchange for equity in their future outcomes.**

Without this ability, we have to wait for the moment that a person is ready to start a company in order to be able to invest in them.
