I really like this philosophy by Stephen Ango (Obsidian ceo). It makes a lot of sense.

I really ought to have the source of truth for whatever I say on my own site. I ought to own that fully. Amen.

I also want to **tweak the presentation to be nicer**. Focus on this only after a certain number of posts. Or rather, after you have a certain number of successful posts - and figure out how you'd define that.
