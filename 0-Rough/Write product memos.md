Take up a product direction. Explain why it's required, how the world is changing, how to build it, and how to win in the space. With more detail than the typical "oh, here's a startup idea". Like, give folks an actual strategy to follow.

*Ideas*
- Platform to invest in individuals.
- Truth seeking copilot: organize knowledge in a way that helps you understand the tree of knowledge. What is agreed upon, and where the lack of consensus lies. How that has changed over time. Basically an advanced tool for someone serious about seeking truth.
- Information consumption: regulate quantity and quality. This is going to be really exciting - an imagination for when we have decentralized social networks and media. You can build powerful experiences on top of it. What does / could that look like?

I'm not interested in anything other than these 3 directions for now. Nothing else feels compelling enough to explore. Dive deep into these. Amen.
