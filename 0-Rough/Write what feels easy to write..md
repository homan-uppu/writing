"Some of my best work was easy to write, and the worst stuff I’ve ever written was agonizing to write. I think it’s similar in most fields. If an idea is good, the work flows easily. Writers’ block – or its equivalent in other jobs – usually means the idea is wrong." - Morgan Housel

This is an interesting thought.

But, at the same time, there are plenty of people that find writing to be really fucking tough, and yet are accomplished writers who've created profound works of art.
