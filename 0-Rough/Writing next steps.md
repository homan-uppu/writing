1. *Notes to self about the 3 directions to explore*:
	1. Seeking truth is the only skill.
	2. Investing in individuals.
	3. Content lens (i.e. what do custom algorithms look like. Exploring ways to give us control over how we discover and navigate the world's information).

I think the next step is to enter an active research phase. For each of these topics, need to bring clarity to what I need to learn. Put together content to consume to understand them. And put them on a kind of schedule.

Completely CUT OUT waste content consumption. It's time to become laser focused.
