**Obsidian is perfectly fine**. Everything is already set up and connected. I like the GIT integration. This means that I can create a writing progress visualization if need be. A dashboard of sorts. Primarily for motivation. To visually see the progress being made.

Just stick to Obsidian for now. Focus on the writing, not on the tool.

But, I would really appreciate the paragraph "zoom" in so that I can handle it one chunk at a time. And I want to find good ways to take advantage of some AI to be able to process content in multiple ways.
