OK, there is a big difference here.

Use writing to express thinking.
Use visuals to express feeling.

Two different modes of operation.
The feeling is where you will shine. The analysis is how you will connect with other creators. Both parts of the mind are necessary. Take advantage of both.

Use each medium for what it's meant for. That's the right way to approach this. Amen.
