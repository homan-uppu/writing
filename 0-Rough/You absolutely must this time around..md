Absolutely. Take the pact of death of you fail. That is the kind of discipline that I require from you.

From here on till death. No matter what happens. I want you to stick to it. No matter how much pain. How much struggle. You're going to stick to it. If you ever find it difficult, go meditate. That is all.

Self restraint is the mark of a thorough man.w
