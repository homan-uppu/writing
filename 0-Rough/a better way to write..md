get through the first draft quickly. eyes closed, just write whatever comes to your midn. don't worry about spelling or anything else, let the AI correct all fo that nontsens.e 

the focus needs to be on just letting the ideas flow out of your mind. there should be absolutely no friction whatsoever. just let it flow.

when i start to slow down what happens is that i stop to sound like me, and i instead sound like someone who wants to sound a certain way that isn't the way that they actually sound. somewhere along the way, i lose my voice and it doesn't sound like me.

i need to be a more prolific writer. yes, the writing may still take days to develop, but i can't keep getting stuck in an essay. not only is it frustrating, i think it's net unproductive in the long run to not have shipped ideas.
