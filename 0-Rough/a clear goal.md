i'm going to build and ship one product that is useful to me.
after this product, i will see what i want to do. but shipping something that is useful to both me and others is my first priority.
ship the 2 essays in the pipeline, and then get to a serious brainstorm of products.

i'm definitely not going to leave here without some momentum - which needs to start with crystal clear clarity on what i'm going to create. that is the goal. not some vague definition of "training the mind" or some other nonsense.

just ship useful things. that is your motto. go hard, but in a very balanced way. don't think too far into the future.
