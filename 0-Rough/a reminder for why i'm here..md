i desire a much stronger mind. a mind that is not feeble, fickle, wavering, but rather one that is unified, collected, concentrated.

a mind that is grounded in the present moment. in reality.

a strong, balanced mind grounded in reality is your best friend. there is no friend, family in the universe that will help and support you more than such a healthy mind.

this is the focus. stick to it.
