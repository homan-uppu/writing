my mind is being impatient right now.
it is not able to be in the present moment.
it is wandering. it is worrying.
such a mind cannot create anything meaningful.

there is a great possibility for what you can contribute. but you need to first sufficiently tame the mind. don't worry, this is the process. there is none other. ease into the daily grind. don't give up. practice the practice. that's all there is to it.
