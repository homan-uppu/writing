This is the age of the individual brand.
No more nameless, faceless entities creating products for us.
Individuals, with their own unique stories, crafting products and experiences from their souls.

I have to build my individual brand. This will require opening myself up to the world and leaning into what makes me me.

Don't build a faceless product that can be copied / replicated. Build something that is deeply intertwined with your individual brand. No one can copy you. You are the only "defensibility". Lean into what makes you unique.
