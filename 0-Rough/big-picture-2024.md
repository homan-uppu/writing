### The path
Meditation:
- 3 hour meditation to start the day (5am - 8am).
- afternoon meditation (3pm - 4).
- To sleep (lie down and sleep while being aware and having equanimity towards your sensations).

*There is no reason to skip any of the sits. This is the bare minimum to maintain the practice.*

*Mastering my mind is my highest priority. I want to be at ease no matter the situation. I want to be able to generate compassion and good will no matter what. Any other achievement pales in comparison to this one.*
### Health
- Strict one meal a day in the evening after Ashtanga.
- Regular Ashtanga Yoga.
- Pushups, pull ups, core strength, PVF exercises. (Every single day, during breaks from work).

*This should put me in optimal health in 3 - 6 months*

*This is a necessary foundation for walking on the path. You need the body to not only last, but support the brutal grind of meditation - it's not easy on the body once you start racking up the hours. Yogasanas supports meditation well.*

*Get my weight, blood pressure, under control.*
*Completely reverse metabolic syndrome.*

### Creating

### Finances.
- By the end of the year, I would like 100k in the bank (after having paid off my debt).
- Will only have the choice to step foot outside of India after I hit 500k in the bank. Only then.
