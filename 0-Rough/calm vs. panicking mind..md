observe the ideas that you have when the mind is calm vs. panicked. and stick only to the ideas you have when the mind is calm. because eventually the mind will settle, and when it does, it's not going to want to stick to what the panicked mind decided to do.

when my mind is calm, i can think much more long-term. i can focus on big ideas that may take a long time to come to fruition. i can imagine more possibilities. i can think further into the future.

when my mind is trembling, i can only think of what i must do to be able to feed myself tomorrow.
