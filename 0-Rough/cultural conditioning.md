cultural conditioning is far more powerful than most give it credit. Most of us, if we had lived in Germany during the era of Hitler, would have called for the massacre of Jews. The cultural conditioning of that era and place would have seeped deeply into our psyche controlling us in ways that we can't see unless we somehow learn to step out.

What are the cultural conditionings that plague us today? What are we doing that if we were born a century later would look back in with disgust thinking there's no way *we* would have done that if we were living in that society in 2024.

I'm sure there are many. I can def share a few in this essay, but that's not the point of this essay, because all they will do is rile up most people reading this and distract you from my main point: that conditioning is incredibly powerful, and holds subconscious control over our lives.

(what else? what is the story that you're trying to communicate here? what is the underlying feeling here that you're trying to give shape to?).
