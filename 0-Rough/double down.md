i haven't come this far just to quit.
i'm going to find my place to practice for 100 days.
out of which some portion will be serious practice, coupled with writing (and publishing).

that's it.

stuck here for 100 days, no matter what.
done.

at the same time: what the fuck am i doing in the middle of nowhere? i get the retreat part of it. actually, i get everything about it. this is what i need right now. by the start of the new year, i should have the angle that i'm going to execute on. amen.
