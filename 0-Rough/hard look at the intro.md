Artificial intelligence is rapidly making knowledge work more creative by doing the less creative grunt work for us. This shift invalidates the core business model of education: paying money to learn. (Note: it also invalidates the business models in which someone else is paying for you to learn: e.g. government subsidies, ISAs).

Paying money for education only works when students have a reliable path to employment (that pays enough) so that they can earn back their investment on a reasonable timeline. But, as the creativity of our work increases, that reliability goes out the window **independent of the quality of the education program**.

Then what's the way out? We have to look at another property of creative work to find the solution: the power law distribution of outcomes. -> and then this leans into the VC business model (which is the power law's best friend).
