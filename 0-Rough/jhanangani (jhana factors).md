To attain the jhanas, the meditator must begin by eliminating the unwholesome mental states obstructing inner collectedness, generally grouped together as the _five hindrances_ _(pañcanivarana):_ sensual desire, ill will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry and doubt.[[2]](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/gunaratana/wheel351.html#fn-2) The mind's absorption on its object is brought about by five opposing mental states — applied thought, sustained thought, rapture, happiness and one pointedness[[3]](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/gunaratana/wheel351.html#fn-3) — called the _jhana factors (jhanangani)_ because they lift the mind to the level of the first jhana and remain there as its defining components.
