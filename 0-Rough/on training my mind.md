this morning's session was productive.
a 2 hour session that felt much, much longer - possibly because it's been a while since i've earnestly worked to concentrate my mind.
the riverside is the perfect place to train my mind. i haven't found a better place yet in my life. - except perhaps in a cabin in the forest. but, there's something special about the constantly flowing river to remind you that your life is flowing just as fast towards death, and that if you're going to do something worthwhile, now is the time.
