pretend you're in jail in some rural part of the world. there's an unhealthy fire just behind you that pushes smoke into your lungs. there's nothing to do. the internet absolutely sucks. you can't talk to anyone.

will you make the most of that situation? or will you crumble under the pressure?

i want you to rise above the pressure.
make the absolute most of it.

grab the weakness inside of you by the neck and throw it out of your system.
