I'm realizing that this phase is going to last longer than I had anticipated. Possibly the entire year. It will take time for doing good work to compound sufficiently such that I have some sort of escape velocity.

I should be prepared to be in this bunkered-down phase for 2 years. Treat it as a self-training. There will likely not be a "quick" explosion until sufficient momentum is achieved. Until then, I will just have to do good work and let nature do the slow, but sure, compounding. And compound it fucking shall. Just keep at it.

Spend the time to get this right. And invest the right resources and time in the hunt - because the plan is reasonably long-term.

- **No disturbances from other people**. Noises of nature, etc. are totally fine. The problem is having unnecessary, unproductive conversations. This needs to be completely eliminated.
- **Close to nature.** There is something about breathing fresh air and drinking clean water that powers the body differently. Should at least be able to go on pleasant walks to clear the mind and think things through.
- **A good desk and chair / good floor desk setup**. I think this may be more important than I've been giving credit for.
- **Productivity infrastructure**: Someone cooks a healthy one meal a day for you. Can heat up water and drink healthy, organic, premium teas / Matcha. Quick delivery of essentials, etc. When necessary: solid internet.
- **Good weather**. I shouldn't be freezing or burning my hands off trying to work. Either weather extreme isn't productive.

When the time is right, think deeply about where to create such an environment. I also feel like it's completely possible to do this here in the Himalayas. There are areas with great internet connections. And getting a desk and chair set up shouldn't be that hard. Will need to get some sort of heater.
