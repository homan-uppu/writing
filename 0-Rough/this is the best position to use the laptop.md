Lean back. It's the bean bag position that worked so well in SF in 2019.

If you can get over not needing a monitor, desk, and fancy chair setup, the world opens up to you. You'll be a LOT more free if you can get used to just laptop setup. Find ways to make it more comfortable so that you don't crave that stationary desk set up that much.

Absolutely. So, I'm going to find good positions for laptop use and just double down on this. Generally, this position that I'm in is quite good: back leaned back, feet gripped on Yoga mat so that it doesn't slide, and laptop on my lap so that the screen is at eye line.

This is solid. Keep experimenting. If you can figure this out, you earn a ton of freedom. Amen.
