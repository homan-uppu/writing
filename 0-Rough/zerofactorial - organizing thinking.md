Execution.

1. *Build a solid feed of knowledge*. Release to an early set of users. Iterate.
2. *Conversations with those who know their shit*.  Who have built. Who have a sense for what knowledge to share, and how to do so. Most of your learning will come from conversations. Not from hacking. You must focus all of your conversations towards knowledge curation, discovery and absorption. Or simply: the essence of what it means to learn.
3. *Scale*.

I'm committed to working on the problem of knowledge discovery and consumption.

I'm building a curated feed of high quality content sourced from every platform - for ambitious builders. This is the starting point.

Actually, there's no need to overthink this at the moment. This immediate problem and solution are quite clear in my mind. The leaning will come from executing on this.
