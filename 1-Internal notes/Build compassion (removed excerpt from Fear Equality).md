The need for compassion, towards others and ourselves, is greater than ever before.

Our minds have been programmed by evolution to respect those that achieve greater results, and respect less those who achieve less. This was useful conditioning for back when we were hunter gatherers. In the context of a tribe, when an individual achieved less it meant less food for the tribe and everyone would suffer. Our craving for external validation, craving for status, and even our jealousy, helped us work hard to contribute equally well to the tribe, so that we weren't left behind. This conditioning helped individuals pass on their genes.

Unfortunately in the modern world this conditioning is outdated. It only leads to suffering, and no longer helps us as it once did.

Asymmetry is inevitable, and it will increasingly be the case that someone or the other achieves much, much more than you. Your neighbor, your childhood friends, a kid that wasn't even born when you started trying to be good at what you do will achieve more than you for reasons that won't be easy to decipher, and will increasingly be difficult to attribute to privilege as we move to a more fair world.

This is why we see another "paradox": in the developed world we have more things, luxuries, and can manifest our ideas more quickly than ever before... yet, we seem less happy. Not retraining ourselves to be aligned with the growing asymmetry impacts our wellbeing.

We will need to retrain ourselves to not put those who have more wealth or status on pedestals. And the only way to do that is to retrain ourselves to not think we are better than others who have less wealth or status than we do. If you think you're good at this, I don't believe you. This habit exists in the deep recesses of our minds. Millions of years of evolution has put them there, and we can't just "think" ourselves out of these habits.

The more asymmetric the world becomes, the more compassion we need to build towards ourselves and others in order to be happy - in ways that were not required in a more symmetric world.

Asymmetry manifests in everything, including our happiness. Those that can retrain their minds will find themselves incredibly happy. Those that cannot will be less happy than previous generations (on average) even though they will have more than those that came before them.

In an extremely asymmetric world, the greatest barrier to getting what we want is our evolutionary conditioning. You are your greatest enemy.
