I'm far too wordy. Conciseness is power. I need to train this ability to be concise. On this pass of the essay, I'm finding that there's just so much to cut. Many paragraphs can be rewritten into a single sentence. Many sentences can be eliminated altogether. So much damn fluff.

It's OK to sound more authoritative than your inner voice because eliminating fluff inevitably makes you sound more authoritative than you are, but it is a better way to communicate.

Be concise. Keep cutting. Sculpt your ideas by removing, not adding. Become great at this.
