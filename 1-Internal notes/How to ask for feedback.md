I made a mistake today. I sent the following:

> Bro, I think I mentioned last time that I'd want to be on a call as you read. I've changed my mind. I think it's more effective if you read thoroughly, craft your feedback, and then we chat about it. 
> 
> No hurry whatsoever (take weeks / months even!) and ofc I'd totally understand if you don't ever find the time. I know how time consuming crafting feedback can be :).

This is a problem because I said "No hurry whatsoever (take weeks / months even!)". I should NOT be planting this laziness in their minds. Just ask for feedback and leave it to them to figure out how quickly they'll do it. That itself is a valuable signal for me. I want to know how they prioritize giving me feedback.

Don't make this mistake again. It's an expensive mistake.
