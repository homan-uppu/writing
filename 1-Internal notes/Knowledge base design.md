### Folders
1. **Rough** - just seeds of ideas and perhaps even random thoughts that will never become ideas.
2. **Notes** - that which has graduated from rough into something that is either an atomic note, or an essay. (todo: define the criteria for what is an atomic note).
3. **Inputs** - these are external sources of knowledge that I reference, or content that I want to consume. Basically, anything external. There is no need to have a sub-organization within this until and unless it becomes too complicated to manage and find what you want.
### Index
All essays will be indexed by [[MAIN]]. This is the primary navigation for things to publish. Should this also be a place to link to atomic notes? I think so! I think that would be great. A single glance at all the seeds of exploration in one place. That is solid.

There will come a point when this file gets too big. You can think about tagging then. Each tag would just be each subheader in the current file, which can later go into their own files if necessary. Not needed now. **This means that for now tags are represented in the index itself, and there is no need for explicit tagging**. Amen.

### Define note

Defining a "note": it is something that I want to share with the world. That is the only defining characteristic. The form may be quite rough, not yet useful, but it ought to be something that I have a desire to flesh out and put out into the world.

But, that isn't enough. I need a note to have achieved a certain quality. A certain level of thought that can at least be tweeted. That's a good criteria. There is at least a tiny nugget of something within it that makes me open my eyes slightly. A slight feeling that it is a building block.

Most things in the rough folder will never become notes. They will be very deep internal thinking that may even be quite personal, and things that I may never want to share with the world. In fact, later I can arrange my site to never even publish the things in "rough", and only allow the world to peek into notes & inputs. (no need to think about this now).

Is there a need to separate a note that is a building block vs. an essay (a deeper exploration of a question)? Of course, but that can be done with the "MAIN" index file which I already have to keep track of the essay.

A note that is a building block may easily become an essay. That's fine. In fact, I predict that any good building block will be a standalone piece that can be published - as an essay, tweet, or whatever. That is great. This reinforces the idea that notes and essays, etc. should just be clubbed into "notes" in a way that doesn't distinguish between both. The point is that the notes folder is more fleshed out than rough, and the note has more value (in terms of what it tells me about myself / the world and what it tugs at me to explore) than a rough idea that never becomes a note (which is likely just some nonsense or something too tailored to my own situation that is unlikely to be relevant to others - though that likely will never be the case because you're not some fucking unique snowflake).

OK, what's the next step?

### A note's title

The title for a note should be similar to a one line, short, tweet that communicates the essence, not something like "On ambition". The one line needs to be precise and concise, this allows for me to scope the building block as tightly as possible.

E.g. "On ambition" becomes "Why the world needs more ambition", "Ambition is a disease", "How to be more ambitious", and likely even more such building blocks. Try your best to scope as tightly as possible to communicate a minimum viable nugget of knowledge. - in fact, this should be a note topic in and of itself. Amen.

### Set default

A new note should always be created in "Rough".
And create (or learn) shortcut to trigger moving a file to another folder.

### Questions
- What about internal vs. external? For example, this jisnu.org presentation file seems reasonably well thought out. It has achieved a notion of "internal" and it shouldn't go in notes which will clutter the things that I want to eventually share with the world. That difference is important. Create another folder for internal for now.
