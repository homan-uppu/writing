1. Diet: completely quit caffeine. Drinking that milked up version of chai / coffee hurts more than it helps.
2. Get back to OMAD by delaying eating till after later aft workout. Don't over-eat. Give yourself 5 hours between eating and sleeping. Go for a walk after dinner every day to help it digest. Don't want to be sleeping with anywhere close to a full stomach.

Going to have a serious daily exercise routine from here on out. I'm going to build the fittest body I've ever built. Period.
