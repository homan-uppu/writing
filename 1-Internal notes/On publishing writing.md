I don't want to rely on Substack. 

I don't want to be on that network because I sense the majority of the folks there are those that want to be "writers". 

I can't visually present my ideas the way I want to on Substack. I like the minimal feel, and Substack is anything but minimal. I want to be able to customize my site in unique ways that achieve my goals. Substack isn't going to design for me.

I'm going to stick to publishing essays on my domain + X + Farcaster (once I figure this thing out). That's it.

My goal for the essays is to build clarity in order to enable execution. That's it.
