### Purpose
1. ***To overcome my mind***. To win over the part of my mind that doesn't feel comfortable expressing itself naturally. That fears what people will think of it.
2. ***To master giving form to my intuitions***. By translating intuitions into words, I give them a form so that I can work with others.
3. ***To master the art of language***. Words are the most powerful weapons in this day and age to defend, attack, and build the future you want to see.
### Publishing
> **Substack** is the right starting point. Earn the right for your own visual experience after you've published 20 essays. That is the point at which you know you're in it. Amen.
### Cadence
> Quality over quantity. Work as hard as you can. Scope tightly so that you publish smaller pieces more regularly than one gargantuan piece that you can't swallow.
### Duration
> This may take months. If not years. It does not matter. Trust your instinct. Build discipline. And just keep at it. Just keep at it. Prepare for years. Decades even.
### Tool
> No AI writing tools. You must own the writing yourself. BUT: there ought to be a way to capture your editing as a form of training data to train a model later on? That would be interesting. But, will that be a useful endeavor? Perhaps. But can't say. I don't have an intuition for when AI will get good enough to give solid writing feedback / to be able to rewrite it in a way that produces great output. Hmm... will have to think this through.

### Information consumption
- Compile a list of people and their works, ideas from modern history (since when we had writing) for me to dig into. Allocate 2-3 hours a day to reading. And spend those 2 hours on the same book until it is complete.
- Restrict consumption to only the highest quality knowledge. Have a very high bar for consumption.
