Most important skill is to make sense of, and update how you feel about things because our understanding of things is represented in feeling, not intellectualization.

- Writing improves thinking. Translating thoughts and intuitions into words shows you how stupid and delusional you are.
- Don't write to become a "writer". The most effective writers are not known as "writers". They create the future through movements. Writing is their starting point.
- The most productive writing helps you understand and update your intuitions. Our thinking is shaped by how we feel about something more than we realize.
- Writing is efficient. There is no faster way to translate your idea into a form that can be shared than to write it out.
- Writing is fast to consume. The most effective people move fast. They'd rather read a paragraph than watch a one minute video.
- Writing is a starting point. Whether you're making a video, building a product, starting a movement, writing is the best way to sow the seed that will grow into other mediums.
- Writing enables great feedback. In conversations we often give feedback on what we wanted to hear and not what was actually said. Writing forces us to give better feedback because any obvious misinterpretation makes us look stupid as the evidence is right there.
- Writing forces you to be more precise.
- Writing is flexible. You can describe a visual scene, a graph, the emotions that a sound needs to invoke and even link to the right examples with just words.
- The one who wrote something has learned an order of magnitude more about it than the one who reads what they wrote.
- You are terribly under-leveraged if you don't know how to write well, no matter the domain.
- Writing well is not about using fancy words, great grammar, but about expressing your ideas in a way that makes good sense and evokes the right emotion. The symbols and rules will change.
- A good writer in one language will be good writer in another quite quickly. All that's required is to pick up the new symbols and rules. The skill is in translating intuitions (feelings) into symbols.
- The world is desperate for great ideas. Idea addicts are the most powerful people in the world. Feed them.

Writing is the most productive way to sharpen the most important skills to thrive in today's world.
