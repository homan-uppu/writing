What a beautiful location for a chai spot. Homely feel. Great shopkeeper. Great view of the Siror bridge. Warm, kind, conversations. Picturesque.

The old wise man going for a walk with his cane who helped me find this place to stay, who was happy that I've settled in.

There really is something special about the small time vibe and warmth. I'll definitely miss it in a bigger city in which we tend to lose the warmth in pursuit of the material.

This experience is teaching me to slow down and do things well. To appreciate nature, people, and warmth. And most importantly, to lean into the slow, seemingly mundane, monotonous lifestyle. It's in such a routine that great work is done. It's in such a routine that magic happens. It's in such a routine that the spark of greatness has a chance to shine.
