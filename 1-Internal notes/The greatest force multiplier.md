The ability to control our attention makes us better at every single thing we do. It's the greatest force multiplier.

"Control" = ability to place attention where we want it to be, for as long as we want it there.

Our minds work in cycles. One bad thought leads to the next and so on. We feed vicious cycles by allowing the cycle to hold onto our attention. 

Inability to control attention is giving up free will. We're taken for rides by our minds in ways we might not want.
