You can't do great work without deriving delight from the process. 

When you crave outcomes without loving the process, you won't last. The path is too brutal for those who don't find joy in taking steps on it.

Most of us are terrible at understanding whether we actually enjoy the process, or just want to enjoy the process (and therefore fake enjoying the process). There are countless professionals jaded by their work who will still say they love what they do. The incentives make them say so: people want to work with people who love what they do, so faking it is beneficial.

You can literally feel the tension in the body when your subconscious dreads spending the next few years on the path you're on. The days become longer. The mind becomes more agitated. Soon, you find yourself craving for some kind of exit, which makes you worse at doing what you're doing.

Of course, not every step is easy. Deriving delight doesn't mean you enjoy every bit of it, just that there is something fundamentally rewarding about doing the difficult work. A sense of purpose. Meaning. Joy that comes from improvement.

As the world becomes more winners-take-all, those who don't inherently enjoy the process, will not become good enough to be valued by the world for their skill. There will not be room for the jaded professionals who are only in it for the money - i.e. who only care about the outcomes and not the process.
