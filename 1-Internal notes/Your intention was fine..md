Don't beat yourself up over an honest mistake. Especially when you did not have incorrect intentions, it just came out in way that could have been misinterpreted to be horrible.
That was never the intention.
Learn to forgive yourself.
Guilt is helpful, when it's a reaction to something that deserves guilt. Because guilt helps create conditioning that prevents you from doing that again.
But, this situation you're ruminating over, does not warrant guilt in any way.

This happens to more situations than you realize. You must forgive yourself. And allow yourself to feel the guilt when it's actually warranted.
