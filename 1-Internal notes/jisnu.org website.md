It fucking matters. And I’m going to do the best job I can possibly do in the presentation layer as well.

### Ideas
- Make the Github repo public - so that you are held accountable for any updates. And to prevent the criticism that you just changed something to avoid a particular criticism that I received without acknowledging it. The more transparent the better.
- Beautiful fonts spacings, etc. Great on all form factors.
- Highlight to be able to leave feedback (may have them sign in). Show all the feedback publicly. (Remember, transparency is key).
- Beautiful animations for the model and any important topic in the essay.
- Want to have a sort of “old school groundbreaking essay” vibe. Some sort of elegantly, minimally, used Serifs, coupled with modern 2024 minimal sans serif. A sort of bridge between the old and the new. Merging two periods.
- When I have enough tweets, create an elegant, useful tweet search and discovery experience on the site itself. **X does a horrible job imo of surfacing old tweets**. I want a similar sort of discovery for them as is possible for my essays. I also don't want to fully depend on the X profile to store my ideas. I should own them as much as possible with the format. When the tech matures, I'll have all of my ideas on the blockchain for sure.

Have 3 layers of content:
- Books (for much, much later).
- Medium form (essays).
- Nuggets of insight / building blocks (these will certainly be tweeted).
I think this would be great to reference nuggets from within essays (especially since many nuggets will be referenced from multiple essays - as the essays are derived from the same fundamental truth).

And loving the Lora font (Serif). Try it out. Also, I’m hating my current style that looks like a cashier receipt - a white strip down the middle of the screen. Just make the entire screen off-white, and don’t look back. Amen.
