Growing up my dad would often use the analogy that when you view clouds from afar it feels as if there are no gaps, but it's only when you get close to them that you see gaps everywhere - in order to teach me that opportunities reveal themselves the more you study reality.

For most matters in life, getting closer to reality means talking to people. Reality is nuanced and incredibly "high resolution". You are guaranteed to have an incomplete, or even false, understanding of what is actually true about the world. Engaging with people to get their feedback / see what their understanding is helps make your model of reality more rich. The more rich and nuanced your model is, naturally the more "openings" you'll find that you can exploit to get what you want from that system.

If you're building a product, approaching the clouds would be having conversations with users (or potential users). Often, in those conversations, you'll find out many more opportunities that you previously didn't even see. But they only revealed themselves through your effort of getting closer to the clouds.

If you applied to a startup accelerator and were rejected, approach the clouds by reaching out to some of the mentors there to get feedback on what you're working on. At least one may respond, and you might build a meaningful relationship with someone you respect. That relationship might end up being much more valuable than anything that accelerator could have given you.

Similarly if you get rejected by a company you want to work at (or ideally before you even apply) strike up conversations with people who already work there somehow (cold messaging, finding introductions, etc.). Get a sense of the kind of work they're doing, what problems they face on a day to day basis, how you can prepare yourself to be a meaningful contributor there and feedback on how to approach applying. If you're earnest, they may even be able to help get your foot in the door at other companies as well.

When you approach anything that seems impossible, opportunities to make it possible always present themselves.

Always approach the clouds.
