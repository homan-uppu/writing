Great ideas start as feelings. We craft ideas from feelings by translating them into mediums that can be understood by others. Only when an idea can be engaged with, understood, modified by others, does it become an idea. Only then can it infect the world. 

"Idea vs. execution" is an illusion. Great execution relies on great ideas. As AI gets better, execution will become entirely about having great ideas. 

All that remains is crafting great ideas.
