*We have less choice than we think.*

Discoveries, not creation, moves the world forward.

When creating things for the world, I used to be of the mindset that the credit for a creation lies primarily in the creator. It was the creator's genius that allowed the idea to exist in the world.

I used to marvel at the genius of creators' whenever I'd experience great work, whether through products, art or anything.

My intention isn't to take away from the greatness of the endeavors required to discover because they save time. And time is our only scarcity. We don't know what the impact of
