This is what I need to bring under my control. Minimize, eliminate frivolous content consumption.

Move your consumption closer to the source. Research papers. Long form novels. Interviews with founders, scientists, etc. that discuss their research. Etc. And, to the extent possible, prefer the source materials over commentaries. The equations rather than the popsci.

Social media is 99% crap. Stick to a limited set of people you consume from. And even then, bias towards their essays, books, longform video interviews, etc. instead of their tweets and other short form stuff.

**Be closer to the truth.** - an essay on information consumption.

I don't want to consume anything outside of what comes through the "Gateway". I'm going to be incredibly disciplined about it.
