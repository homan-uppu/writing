Experiential knowledge is muscle memory. It manifests as feelings and intuitions about what the right thing to do is. There may be no rational explanation for why your gut tells you to do something. Experiential knowledge can only be gained by doing.

Intellectual knowledge can be represented in words, principles, guides. You can share intellectual knowledge with others. You can read it. You can reason about it.

Mastery in any skill worth mastering requires building experiential, intuitive understanding of how to perform that skill well. Intellectual understanding alone doesn't suffice for mastery.

You can read all the books you want on swimming. You can visualize the right technique. But the only way to become a great swimmer is by getting into the water so that the other non-intellectual layers of your mind also grasp the skill.

Someone who has read about fire will not have the same emotional response to a flame as someone who has been burned before. The one who's been burned can sense fire from afar. Even the smallest tinge of smoke in the air makes their body more alert and prepared for a potential fire ahead.

Similarly, an entrepreneur can literally "smell" the situations that lead to blunders, becoming more alert in order to avoid the same mistake again. Whereas someone who "studies" business by reading won't have that same emotional response to the situations that surround and precede blundering.
### It's impossible to share intuition with others.
You can write about it.
### The value of intellectual knowledge is falling
Historically, you could create significant value in the world by simply having the right intellectual knowledge for how to do something.

Systems were less sophisticated. We didn't have software (and now AI) to do menial tasks for us. There was room for those who only had intellectual understanding to contribute.

That is quickly falling.

- The more free markets dominate the world, the more closely aligned every company / organization will need to be with reality in order to survive.
- The more each company is more aligned with reality, the more each individual needs to be aligned with reality.
- Reality is too complex to be understood intellectually. Intuition gets much closer to understanding reality.
- Thus, experiential understanding is swiftly becoming more valuable than intellectual understanding in all domains. It's less about what you know, and more about your intuition. It's less about reading about swimming and more about just getting in the goddamn water!
- This is a trend that is becoming amplified.

-> Might have the opportunity to weave in the theory about Suta, chinta, bhavana maya pannas.

- Only the person who explores all the possibilities, makes the decision, and takes responsibility for the decision builds the best intuition. - *this is a very good, a very important point.*
