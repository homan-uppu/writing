- A small percentage of individuals hold most of the wealth.
- A small percentage of employees in a company are responsible for the majority of output.
- A small percentage of companies capture most of the market.

The world is quite asymmetric, and this asymmetry is accelerating rapidly. It cannot be stopped because everything we want: better human rights for all, better technology, great art, less wars - makes the world more asymmetric.

The more asymmetric the world becomes, the less world values those that are average at what they do.

Rate of change is accelerating. There is no longer stagnation, only accelerated growth or accelerated death. Average teams & companies will become irrelevant shockingly fast as the great ones increasingly capture most of the value. Average players in any game will not be valued. They can either become great at what they do, change what they do to something they are great at, or create something new to do, that the world will value, and become great at that.

There is no room for the average anywhere, and it's increasingly important to become great at what you do. I assure you that you're average (I certainly am <FootnoteReference number={1} />) - especially if you think you're OK continuing what you're doing in the way you're doing it. Our mediocrity will be exposed rapidly making it more difficult to get what we want, and the path to becoming great will require a massive change in how we live our lives.

To see why, we need to understand what causes asymmetry, how it's changing, and how that makes being average more painful than ever before.

Asymmetry is a function of complexity. The greater the complexity, the greater the asymmetry.

In games, complexity corresponds to the number of possibilities within the game. A simpler game has fewer possibilities, while a more complex game has many more possibilities.

Most human endeavors can be modeled as a games: "success" is the satiation we feel from getting what we want, and we explore to get what we want by making choices (making "moves" in the game). Therefore we can study asymmetry in simpler games and extrapolate our learnings to the more complex games we play.

Let's take three games: [Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) (simple), [Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess) (medium complexity), [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) (high complexity). (If you're not familiar with these games, please read a bit about them before proceeding).

Tic Tac Toe is simpler than Chess because there are less possibilities of the game because there are much fewer board positions you can end up at. Similarly Chess is less complex than Go because there are fewer board positions that are possible in the game, meaning less overall possibilities.

We can observe asymmetry in these games in two ways: 
1. Asymmetry in the moves to make
2. Asymmetry in the outcomes of players

Some moves are obviously better than others, meaning there's a notion of "value" such that the higher the value of a move, the better it is: the more it corresponds with winning (getting what you want).

The greater the asymmetry in moves, the less equal the values of the moves are. In a simple game like Tic Tac Toe, in a competition between two trained players, all moves are valued equally because a draw can always be forced. In a game of Chess (medium complexity), from any given position of the board, there are a range of values for the moves you can make. There are better and worse moves, and there is some difference between the best move and the next best move. In Go, similar to Chess, there are better and worse moves, but the gap between the best move and the next best move is greater than it is in Chess because Go is a more complex game.

Greater asymmetry in moves leads to greater asymmetry of outcomes. We can observe this by seeing the ELO ratings of professionals for these games. "ELO rating" is a way to calculate relative skills of players:

> The difference in the ratings between two players serves as a predictor of the outcome of a match. Two players with equal ratings who play against each other are expected to score an equal number of wins. A player whose rating is 100 points greater than their opponent's is expected to score 64%; if the difference is 200 points, then the expected score for the stronger player is 76%. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system))

It's important to note that the difference in ELO rating doesn't translate linearly to the difference in wins. Someone who is a few hundred ELO rating higher than another will almost certainly win.

In Go, the difference in ELO rating of the top two players is 183 ([https://www.goratings.org/en/](https://www.goratings.org/en/)), whereas in Chess, the difference in ELO rating of the top two Chess players is only 25 ([https://www.chess.com/players](https://www.chess.com/players)).

The gap between the best and the next best is greater in Go than in Chess. Meanwhile there's no need for ELO rating for Tic Tac Toe because every "professional" would draw, meaning everyone's ELO would be zero. Similarly, the gap between the 2nd best and 3rd best is greater the more complex a game is. We observe this in the ELO ratings of professionals in Chess and Go. The more complex the game, the greater the difference in outcome of the nth and the (n+1)th player. 

Asymmetry is not linear. The gap between the best player and the 2nd best player is larger than the gap between the 2nd best player and the 3rd best, and so on. The greater the complexity of the game, the greater the gap between the best and the rest, and the more skewed the curve looks.

Lastly, we should notice that the more complex the game becomes, outcomes (i.e. ELO ratings) become more equal the further you go towards worse players. ***In other words, the more complex the game, the more likely that when two players are equally good it means that they're farther in ability from the best.***

The games we play today to get the things we want are of much, much more complex than the games we discussed above, leading to far greater asymmetry in the actions we take, and in our outcomes.

But, if the games we play have always been more complex than the board games we discussed, then why haven't we always seen a great deal of asymmetry in the world, and importantly, why is it increasing?

That's because the complexity of the games we play is a function of leverage. By leverage I mean: how little time it takes to turn an idea into reality. The greater the leverage available to you, the less time it takes you to turn your ideas into reality.

Human progress increases leverage, and spreads it to more people. For example, when a dictatorship is replaced by a democracy, the citizens gain leverage because they are more free and therefore can manifest their ideas that they previously couldn't. When a new technology is created, it reduces the time it takes to turn your idea into reality, thereby increasing leverage.

Computers, internet, artificial intelligence, government policies, greater individual freedom, etc. all work to increase leverage in the world.

Greater leverage increases the complexity of the games we play in three ways:
1. By reducing the time per move.
2. By eliminating the need to play simpler games (because technology does it for us).
3. By increasing the possibilities within any game, thereby making the game itself more complex.

When it takes a long time to make a move, the underlying asymmetry doesn't manifest quickly. Imagine a game of chess where each move took 5 years to make. By the time the players die, their differences wouldn't be that apparent. It's not that the asymmetry wasn't there, but that it didn't have enough time to present itself.  Over the past decade technology has drastically reduced the time it takes to turn an idea into reality - i.e. the time it takes to make a move, and therefore the underlying asymmetries manifest themselves faster.

As leverage increases, we stop playing simpler games. Before we had computers, a large amount of time and effort was involved in keep track of numbers and basic numerical calculations. As we gained better technology, we were able to shift more of our time to playing more complex games: figuring out what to create and how to create it.

And lastly, games that were always complex become even more complex due to leverage. Our subconscious is limited by the leverage we have available to us. Our minds don't like to dream about things that it believes are impossible. Most filmmakers a century ago likely wouldn't have dreamt of making a film about intergalactic politics, and constrained their ideas to films that could take place in the normal world. As leverage increased, filmmakers were able to dream bigger and wider. Their minds opened up to more possibilities within the same game, making the game itself more complex.

I made a claim earlier that the games we play are far more complex than Chess and Go. A good reader would have been annoyed that I offered no explanation.

There is a hierarchy of complexity for human endeavors. The most complex human activities are the ones in which success is measured by how good you make people feel.

And the representational complexity of feeling is far greater than that of Chess or Go. By representational complexity I mean how easy it is to describe the state of the game at any moment in time. A game that has a much more complicated state, likely has many more possibilities for what moves you can take, and is therefore more complex in general.

To see why, recall when you had to communicate how you felt. You'll remember how difficult it is to do so, and importantly that no matter how many words you use, you weren't able to fully, completely, represent your feeling in words. This is because a feeling has a much higher representational complexity than words. Trying to represent a feeling in words is difficult because we are trying to represent something of a higher complexity into a medium that has less complexity. Information is bound to be lost in that translation.

This lost information is precisely what allows for the various interpretations of words. Every single person reading this essay will have different feelings as they read this. Even though my intention is to make you feel what I feel about this topic, there is absolutely no way for me to do so without any loss of information, no matter what medium I use: words, images, videos, symbols, anything - even if I spend my entire life trying. I believe this gap between feeling and how well we can communicate it is quite large. <FootnoteReference number={3} />

The representational complexity of Chess and Go can easily be represented by symbols (text, pictures, etc.), and therefore I believe that any game in which success is measured by how good you make people feel will be orders of magnitude more complex than Chess and Go (proportional to the difference in complexity between feeling and a sequence of symbols).  The underlying asymmetry that we are moving towards is quite extreme because we are moving towards "feeling games".

A couple of centuries ago, most workers spent their time playing games that had nothing to do with how to make someone feel. For example, they may assemble physical things in a factory and success was measured by how well and fast you could put together multiple parts of a product. As that region progressed, they built better technology, and offshored simpler work to other places, leaving workers to move up complexity towards services such as marketing, support, design, etc, which are closer to solving for how to make people feel good.

We notice this trend today as well. Programmers are being asked to become better at thinking about what to build and understanding users, [without just thinking about how to build something](https://x.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1637087219591659520). Animators are being asked to contribute something meaningful to the story instead of only translating a rough sketch into a completed animation. Pizza cooks, and ice cream store employees, are all being asked to tell engaging stories on social media to attract more customers. 

***Everyone is moving towards figuring out how to make people feel.***

Artists for thousands of years have been solving for how to make people feel. Which is why it's no surprise that the arts have always had extreme asymmetry. Human progress is pushing us all towards the games that artists have been playing for a long time, and also towards the intense asymmetry that artists have felt for a long time.

We can't be satisfied with any conclusions about asymmetry without also considering the role of fairness. The real world is not like a board game. Life's not fair.

Let's imagine a fairy tale world in which every child has loving, caring, supportive parents, the best teachers, and the freedom to explore what they want. Let's say no one is concerned about how to make a living, and everyone has access to great healthcare, a fast fair legal system, etc. And that everyone has very high leverage: anything we imagine can be manifested into reality much more quickly than today.

Have an idea for an app? It'll be manifested in a day. The same for a video, song, etc. If you can imagine an idea and express well enough through some mediums (language, drawing, etc.), then something will turn it into reality quite quickly. In this world, all you will care about is to create things that you want - whether that's art, better tools, physical things, etc.

What do you think the outcomes of this imaginary world would look like?

I believe it would be incredibly asymmetric. The richest person in this imaginary world will be so stupidly rich that it's unfathomable to us right now. And that there would be great variance in outcomes across the board.

I believe this because in a highly leveraged world, we have more possibilities and we make moves much more quickly. Therefore, slight differences in choices at the start of the game would lead to drastic differences by the time we die due to the complexity of the game.

And not all explorations are equally worthwhile. Someone who spends their entire life learning how to craft the best baskets to sell to their village will not have the same outcomes as someone who explored building software products for large audiences. <FootnoteReference number={4} />

Being influenced slightly differently early on leads to slightly different choices, which will have incredibly large difference in where you end up. The greater the leverage, the greater the difference in where you end up.

Two twins that open up a social app and see two different videos are in influenced in subtly different ways. Each slightly different choice compounds greatly and they will end up in very different places in their exploration of life. The greater the leverage in the world, the more pronounced the difference in how they explore life. 

***Twins born a century ago, on average, would have explored life less differently than twins born today.***

And this isn't even taking into account the difference in our abilities at birth! If we include that, then asymmetry would be even greater. I think it's silly to think that we're not born with different capabilities, different strengths and weaknesses, different emotional reactions to the same stimuli. Nature is an incredibly complex system - possibly more complex than our feelings. I believe you're deluded if you expect nature to produce two equal things - of anything.

Therefore, in a fair, highly leveraged world in which our activities are complex, we would see extreme asymmetry.

---

Unfairness can also cause inequality. But the shape of the inequality caused by unfairness is fundamentally different than the shape of the inequality caused by a fair, leveraged world. Being able to differentiate between them is an important skill that, as we'll see later, will help us navigate an asymmetric world.

Equality that stems from unfairness is different in that there are more rigid boundaries between classes, and it's more difficult to move from one class to another. Hierarchical caste systems that tell you what you can and cannot do with your life, that you have different rights and potentials than other casts, are incredibly unfair. Even in the industrial revolution, there was a large, rigid divide between workers and those that were able to afford to build factories - quite unfair, but less unfair than the caste systems that gave you absolutely no way to rise. There were at least a dozen factory workers across the entire industrial revolution that were able to start their own factories at some point. The same can't be said about someone born as an "untouchable" who wanted to, say, learn how to read and write.

The graph of outcomes in an unfair world looks like a step function. You will find different classes, and you'll see that there aren't any individuals with outcomes in between the outcomes of the two classes. In other words, all factory workers would make roughly equal outcomes, whereas all factory owners would make roughly equal outcomes, but you'd find very few in between the workers and the owners. This is a symptom of unfairness.

Inequality that stems from a complex world with fairness and leverage is a smoother curve: you will find individuals at all sorts of different outcomes. We can see this in the outcomes for our board game examples: though the difference between the best and the rest is large, if you plotted everyone on a graph, it would be a much smoother curve than the one you would see if you plotted all outcomes in the industrial revolution.

When you look at those curves closely, you'll notice something interesting: the more unfair curves are also more "equal" because they have more people that are making roughly the same, but just divided by classes. Whereas the inequality from fairness and leverage is far less equal because it's tougher to find even a few individuals with the same outcome.

***Therefore, counterintuitively, the way to sniff out unfairness is to see how much equality exists in the outcomes***. The more equality that exists (i.e. the more it looks like a step function), the more cautious we ought to be. And complete equality (like the outcomes of Tic Tac Toe) is fair, but terrible, because it means our activities are not complex enough. It would be fair in that we'd all be equally terrible at life. But what you'll see in any unfair system is that there will always be someone who sits a step above a group of others, who, within their group, have equal outcomes.

There is a lot of unfairness in the world today because there is still too much equality. But it is much better than ever before. Our curve of outcomes is smoother than ever before in modern history.

The idea that a fair world would be equal is delusional. A more fair, more leveraged world will be more unequal in outcomes, because the underlying exploration of life will be more varied. And the inequality that stems from unfairness is actually more equal than the inequality that stems from fairness & leverage.

Yet, it's undeniable that the rich child that has access to higher quality, personalized, feedback, more competent, ambitious peers, a stronger safety net, and more supportive loving parents, has an unfair advantage. We have a lot of work to do to make the world fair. And we ought to fight hard for that fairness, but not by pulling down the rich kid's experience, but by making it accessible to all.

The world is getting better. In many of the poorest communities around the world, many kids have the ability to create, to speak their minds in ways their grandparents couldn't dream of, and have access to information and knowledge through the internet that is barely any less than a rich kid in Manhattan.

Therefore as we fight for human rights across the world we will actually see greater asymmetry because we now have more players in the game that have access to the same leverage the rest of us do. There are more people to increase the leverage in our world. The greater the leverage, the greater the asymmetry.

We must fight for a more fair, leveraged world, and deal with the asymmetry that it results in, and not expect that we will have greater equality in outcomes in a more fair world.

---

But, asymmetry isn't increasing linearly, but rather accelerating exponentially. Therefore the complexity of our activities rises exponentially, and so does asymmetry.

Global GDP is a rough, but directionally correct, approximation of the leverage in the world. The more leverage that exists in the world means that we are able to turn more ideas into reality, creating and selling more things of higher value.

It's only a rough approximation because it only represents the transactions between us that involve a monetary exchange. There are many transactions that increase due to leverage that aren't yet directly captured by an exchange of money, such as liking posts on social media.

GDP is also a lagging indicator of leverage because it takes time to turn leverage into transactions because even though the time it takes to turn an idea to reality decreases, it's still not instantaneous. Only implemented ideas have an opportunity to impact GDP, so we will see what today's leverage is after some time: once people have applied today's leverage to implement good ideas.

Therefore, leverage is accelerating exponentially because global GDP is accelerating exponentially: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-gdp-over-the-long-run.

Due to this exponential acceleration, we are likely to see a rise in asymmetry in the next few years that is proportional to the rise in asymmetry over the past century, if not more.

---

Asymmetry is a function of complexity. The greater the complexity of a game, the greater the asymmetry within the game and the greater the asymmetry in the outcomes of the game. The complexity of the games we play is a function of leverage. As leverage increases our activities become more complex. Leverage is a function of human progress. Every advancement: technology, human rights, medicine, policy, etc. pushes us towards a more leveraged and fair world. Leverage increases exponentially fast, making asymmetry increase exponentially fast.

Why do the average not have room in an asymmetric world?

Greater asymmetry means that those that are great at what they do will account for most of the productivity within teams, and the greatest teams will account for most of the productivity in the world - in any domain.

As asymmetry increases:
1. As a few become increasingly responsible for the majority of the productivity of a team. Everyone but the few will be let go.
2. The individuals that remain within a team will increasingly do work that looks different from what anyone else in their team is doing. The more similar their activities are, the more true it will be that a few will be much better than the others, which reduces the need for the others.
3. Teams will more aggressively need to search for the best talent because best will be much more valuable than ever before and no number of average players can will be able to match the productivity of a great player.
4. Teams will be able to more easily & quickly let go of average players because the average contribute less to the productivity of the team - letting them go rocks the boat less.

This dynamic leads to a "paradox" whenever leverage increases: companies will fire many employees while simultaneously creating job postings with higher compensations than ever before. They've let go of the average and are seeking the greats - for the same roles. Of course such companies will have to lie to the world by saying that those let go are incredibly talented and that it wasn't their fault. But you will know it's a lie because they will still be hiring aggressively for the same role they fired.

As leverage increases, average teams will become irrelevant much more quickly than ever before. Teams too will have no choice but to become great or perish, just as individuals within those teams.

The standards that determine what is great will also sharply increase in proportion to leverage. Whenever a player arises that pushes the boundaries of what we thought was possible, what is considered great will also skyrocket. Such breakthroughs will happen more quickly than ever before as leverage increases, and the magnitude of each breakthrough will also be greater than ever before because in a highly asymmetric world, a small percentage improvement in how to do something leads to massive gains in outcomes.

Therefore, as asymmetry increases, there is also less room for complacency. Great companies, teams, individuals can become average shockingly quickly.

As the room for average disappears, we will need universal basic income. But that income will never be enough to enable you to get what you want.

I don't believe basic income will ever reach a point that will make us feel satisfied with it. Of course, it may initially afford us great healthcare, a home, etc., but it will never be enough for the same reason that the bar for "great" sharply rises with increase in leverage. When we have more breakthroughs in medicine, housing, arts, technology, clothing, etc. a basic income will not allow you to afford those breakthroughs until those creations become cheaper, which takes time. This leads anyone relying on a basic income to get what they want to always feel that what they want is out of reach.

This will lead to another "paradox": people will feel like they don't have enough, but if someone from a century ago time traveled to their present, they'd find the things they complain about to be silly. In other words, in absolute terms our species will be better off than ever before, yet in the day-to-day we will not be satisfied with what we have.

Why can't we have a very high basic income that allows us to afford many of the breakthroughs? Because it doesn't optimize for GDP growth. The country that maximizes GDP growth is a country that is perpetually in a state of not having enough. Having a basic income higher than whatever is the optimal amount to maximize GDP will not last. 

Maximizing for GDP is important for a country if it wants to retain its ability to provide for itself. Asymmetry also applies to countries: we will see the "top" country spit away from the pack and be very far ahead. For average countries to even think about basic income (on their terms), they will need to maximize their GDP growth to be able to tax it and redistribute that wealth for everyone. There is no stagnation, countries that don't become great will rapidly decline. As economies decline, everything within a country de-stabilizes and they will need to seek support from the countries at the top. That support will always come with conditions that they will be forced to accept. Therefore, I don't believe the world can stop optimizing for GDP growth because no country wants to live life on another country's terms. 

That being said, I would honestly be incredibly happy if you disagree that we will always optimize for GDP and that the basic income we will achieve will one day be enough for many humans to be able to afford what they want - even if that basic income comes at the cost of GDP growth. Even if there exists such a possibility, you will need to be incredibly ambitious and great at what you do in order to achieve it. There is no room for the average in the endeavor to create a world that supports the average in the way they want to be supported. I hope you succeed... for my sake.

Ambition was once rewarded. Today, ambition is required.

You may not like how the system is setup. You may not want to be more ambitious or great at what you do, and you may want to leave everything behind and live in a remote area of the world and just live life. I think that's a great idea if that's what you want. But, what you'll see is that leaving the system behind will increasingly require a greater ambition than what is required to be great in the system.

Becoming great at what you do doesn't have to be a miserable process. In fact, it should be enjoyable because increasingly the only way to become great is to do what you're meant to do. Who do you think will be a better filmmaker, one that is naturally obsessed with stories and dreams of scenes all the time or one that's in it for the money? 

No matter what you choose to do: be a part of the system, change the system, or exit the system, you will need great ambition, and be great at what you do. There is no longer room to be average and coast.

For those who are ambitious and want be great at what they do, the world is only getting better. You will be able to turn your dreams into reality more quickly than ever before. You will be able to implement your ideas for the entire world. You will have access to knowledge, tools, arts, and freedom that your ancestors couldn't have even imagined. 

It won't even matter what you want to be great at. The greatest parents will be rewarded for sharing their knowledge on how to parent. The greatest chefs will be able to "cook" for the entire world at once. The greatest artists will capture the imagination of billions. The greatest financial advisors will manage the most of the world's money. 

***Just be great.***

I'm not being modest. I believe underplaying one's abilities is a form of dishonesty and I wouldn't do that. My hunch about how much room for the average there is the world today given the current leverage that exists in the world makes me genuinely believe I am average and that if I don't rapidly become great at what I do, I will not get the things I want. If you believe I'm better at what I do than you are, then you have more work than I do - which is already a lot!

I also believe I will become great at what I do within a few years. This essay and the essays I'm going to write are primarily for me to understand what the best path to do so is. My motivations are entirely selfish.
