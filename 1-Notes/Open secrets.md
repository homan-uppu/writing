The best secrets aren't the ones closely guarded, but the ones that no one will believe no matter how hard you to try to convince them.

Of course what you're saying has to be true. If it's not, it's a delusion, not a secret.

As our activities become more complex, intuition plays a greater role in success.

The greater the role of intuition, the more freely you can share what you know.

Even if you share all of your planning, ideas on what to do next and how to do it, no one can copy your intuition: they will not be able to have the same quality ideas you will have in the future based on this knowledge - that you yourself don't yet know!

This is a function of leverage because leverage influences the complexity of our work. The greater the leverage we have, the more freely you ought to share what you're doing.
