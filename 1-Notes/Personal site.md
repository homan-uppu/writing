## some ideas
- Karthik Uppu written in cursive / Ji. 
- Time to go back to using your actual name. Might want to cut some parts to make it good for SEO. Yeah, can't find a good SEO here. Unfortunate. Think about this later.
- "think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world" - put this quote on my landing page.
- "Work is worship"

I'm going to spend time thinking about how this site can best represent me. It will be my "calling card". It will be something that I share with others often. It will be a core part of my brand.

## brand
- 10^n: power law (capital). The 10^n is surrounded by all sides by the power law graph such that all the lines form to create a sort of square with a border radius. this feels right. the power law is what i'm basing all of my work for the world on. i'm betting the house on it.
