One of the hallmarks of ancient thinkers of the East was their fixation on the notion of "liberation": to put an end to your suffering once and for all. To never have to suffer again at all.

Now, that's a lofty goal. And the path to liberation is supposedly the most difficult task for a human. Even if you don't believe in the possibility, and instead believe that suffering is inevitable, unchangeable aspect of the human condition, you still probably believe in some notion of self-actualization: that we can, by doing some work, attain greater peace, happiness, and fulfillment in our lives.

I used to believe that by building technology to do the "other things" for us, we'd have the opportunity to be less busy with the mundane world, and instead would have far more time to pursue liberation / self-actualization. That, as a species, we'd actually be more at peace with ourselves when compared to, say, our hunter gatherer ancestors for whom death was much more likely to strike at any moment.

But, as I see how the world is evolving, I suspect that it's actually becoming more difficult to make the time and space to understand yourself and put forth the internal effort required to become... happier.

Satyajit Ray noticed this shift in the middle of the 20th century. He talked about how the average man's life in Calcutta was more slow paced, and how that, in a sense, made people in India more "free" than those he saw in London who seemed to be slaves to the clock. Running around meeting deadline after deadline, with seemingly no space to just... be. To just lounge around.

Yet, you could say that the average man or woman in London in the mid 20th century had more security than the average person in Calcutta at the same time. One bad harvest, famine, or political shift could easily mean the death of millions.

Technological progress and the advancement of our species is the best solution we have to assure against calamities. Covid-19 if it had occurred a couple hundred years ago would have been far more devastating, both in lives lost and the economic impact on the individual. And there are so many benefits to technology that goes beyond mere survival assurance. It's reduced the gap between the rich and the poor - not in how much money they have, but in their access to information and resources. Some of the poorest people in the world have more power in their pockets than the richest kings of the past. Technology has given more people a voice, allowing them to participate in the constantly ongoing, evolving global discourse.

Yet, in the midst of all of these positive changes, our technological advancements have had a deep impact on our culture. We are moving much faster than before, despite having better assurances for survival than ever before. We seem to have less time to ourselves than ever before. We bombard our brains with rapid, frequent hits of dopamine, causing all sorts of chemical reactions within us, literally making time move faster for us.

We're accelerating towards our deaths faster than anyone ever before. With all the hooplah, the nail biting sports events, the political drama, the 100 incredible movies and tv shows that come out every year, the inventions, the products. For the first time ever, it's actually, literally impossible to keep up with all the great work put out into the world every day.

We have more choice than ever before. We have more assurances against death than ever before. We're more distracted than ever before. We don't seem to have time to do the really difficult, inner work towards each of our liberations, or self-actualizations

Take our phones away from us for a few days and most of us feel a vicious agitation grip us.

But we're not only distracted by information, our rat races have become all-encompassing.

Our rat races have evolved from our villages and cities to being global. Any upcoming basketball player in any part of the world is watching the best players in the entire world and comparing themselves to them. This is fantastic to rapidly increase the global talent pool of players. But it's probably worse for the majority of the players' mental health (the ones who don't make it to be good enough), than ever before. 

Our minds haven't evolved to compare ourselves with billions. Envy was probably useful in small tribes. When you see a fellow hunter perform better than you, you're going to work your ass off to be better. The village benefits. And you benefit because the difference in your skill probably wasn't that great to start off with. The globally best hunter could be orders of magnitude better than anybody in your village, but none of you would have even heard about them.

But that same envy which would make you more productive and perform better in a small group has a very different impact when you can rank yourself against every single person in the entire world, at anything that you do. Test scores. Sports rankings. Money raised. Views. Likes. You name it. Everything is a global competition.

Now, of course it's easy to say "don't compare yourself with others", especially as you get older and are better able to see the nonsense games of the world. But I can't imagine a younger version of myself to be able to actually practice not comparing myself with others. Heck, I still catch myself from time to time comparing myself and have to pull myself away. And I'm sure it's still happening in the deep subconscious parts of my mind. We're programmed to compare ourselves. Since the competition is much larger than ever before, we're more panicked by our position.

For some of these problems, technology can actually help us. For others, we're left to fight our deep programming on our own.

- We've already seen some movements towards less dopamine driven existence. I think they will grow. The best creators in the world will need more space to think.
- Technology may be We will have better technology that supports protecting our attention. Decentralized social media.
