The social value is incredible. I want to publish more quickly because I want the world to challenge my ideas. I want the world to push me to be better. I want to take advantage of my craving for status and recognition to actually enable me to do the best I can for the world.

I'm craving the momentum that comes from publishing and growing my ideas in view of the public consciousness. That's what I want.

It's time to push myself harder. It's really time.
