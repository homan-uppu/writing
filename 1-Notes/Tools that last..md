- Obsidian
- Decentralized social platforms.

I've only recently started to appreciate tools, products, companies that just... last. Just being around in a few decades is an under-appreciated feature.

I used to crave trying out new products. Moving my content and knowledge from one system to the next. But, at some point constantly shifting took a toll. I felt like I was just a guest in all the products I was using. Never felt like home.

I've only recently leaned into Obsidian and one of my favorite things about it is that it's just an editor for text files that sit on my computer. I back up those files how I want. And no matter what happens (even if Obsidian disappears from the face of the earth for some reason), I know my system to make sense of the world won't fundamentally be rocked.

Obsidian's is built on an open source data model (markdown files). How it interacts with that data can easily be replicated in another tool. The same can't be said about, say, Notion. If Notion goes down, it's a lot more effort to build new tools for their custom block based data model.

I'm already building another tool that I use alongside Obsidian (for knowledge consumption instead of creation) that is also based on markdown.
