These are the incentives of a group of organisms in which each organism wants things and wants to get what it wants as quickly as possible. I believe we would see the same incentives in any alien civilization that is at least as intelligent as we are, given enough time - if they too want things and want to get what they want as quickly as possible. They too will become winners take all. To reverse these incentives we would need to reverse the underlying cause. Good luck.
