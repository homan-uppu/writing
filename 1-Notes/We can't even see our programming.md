"But, I wouldn't want to do that!" is the most insidious form of our mental conditioning.
Our wants are not in our control as we'd like to believe. They are conditioned by all sorts of things and people that we've seen growing up. We don't have as much choice as it seems.

If I told you it were possible to overcome any craving, that all you have to do is be patient and wait it out. That you could overcome your craving to build that business, or make that art, or to overcome your craving for whatever you want to do in life right now that is beyond your basic needs, without actually doing it, and become more peaceful as a result, all of us would reply with some form of "But I wouldn't want that!". And that's the point. We wouldn't want to get rid of our most deeply held wants.

Are we the ones wanting?
Or are we simply acting on the wants that are forming within us as a reaction to the world we live in?

How much do our desires or life directions do we actually control?
How much do they run our lives without our say?
