title: Why paying for education doesn't work
date: May 2024

Paying for education no longer works because we are moving towards a "winner-takes-most" world. Increasingly, those who aren't one of the best will struggle to contribute to the economy.

In such a world, most people who train themselves won't become good enough, or won't be good enough on a predictable schedule. They can't reliably recuperate their investment. Paying for education doesn't work.

Our world is becoming more complex. The more complex our activities, the more variance we find in ability - no matter the quality of training, or duration. A group of startup founders with excellent training in how to build a successful startup will still have a great variance in ability because building a company is a very complex task.

Small differences in ability lead to larger differences in productivity. A decade ago, the best software engineers might have been 10x better than the average. Today the best engineers are probably 100x - 1000x as productive as the average.

As the gap in productivity between the best and the rest is growing rapidly, companies are forced to wait for great talent rather than hire thousands of average. This was not the case when the best were only marginally better than the average. But when the best set of talent can be more productive than the rest combined, hiring the average becomes unfeasible.

Complexity: 

As complexity of skills increases, any entity that sells education faces pressure from both sides:
1. The cost of attracting instructors who are competent enough to teach the skill is skyrocketing because the skill itself is becoming more difficult and those that are great at it command a lot more on the market. 
2. There is a greater variance in productivity: many more students will not become good enough no matter the quality of the training because the skill itself is far more complex.

Leverage: 

We are moving towards a winner-takes-most world because:
1. The more complex the skill, the greater variance in ability no matter the training.
2. Better technology increases the complexity of our activities, creating greater variance in ability.
3. Better technology amplifies advantage: small differences in ability lead to larger differences in productivity.
4. Large differences in productivity lead to large differences in wealth (as the world becomes more fair).

The more complex the skill, the greater variance in ability no matter the training.

No matter how much training startup founders / creators / marketers have, there is bound to be large variance in their ability.

The more complex an activity is, the more possibilities it has. A factory worker has a limited number of choices at any given moment in time, leading to few possibilities in how they assemble. An artist has an infinite number of choices and possibilities, making their work far more complex.

For simpler activities, with enough training, it is possible to become close to the best in ability. The best factory worker is only moderately more productive than the average one. But, the best startup founder is orders of magnitude more productive than the average one: the average founder fails, while the best achieves unfathomable outcomes.

This will be true, regardless of the quality of education. Even if the best entrepreneur or artist coached students 24/7 for a decade, the students would still have great variance in ability. There will always be some who are better at making things people want due to the higher complexity of the activity.

If we could plot the ability of professionals on a graph, we would notice it follows a power law distribution. The best player is much better than the second-best. The gap is smaller between the second and third best, and so on.

The more complex the activity, the differences are more pronounced. The gap in ability between the best creator and the next best is much larger than the gap between the best factory worker and the next best. By many orders of magnitude.

Our work is rapidly becoming more complex. Greater leverage makes activities more complex by letting us skip simpler activities and by making complex activities even more complex. Leverage is how little time it takes to implement an idea. The more leverage you have, the less time it takes to manifest your ideas.

Before computers, we spent a lot of time crunching numbers. As we gained better technology, we could spend more time figuring out what to create and how - which are much more complex than crunching numbers.

Greater leverage makes what was once impossible possible, increasing the complexity of an activity. Building software got much more complex when the world adopted smartphones because there were many more possibilities in what you could build and who you could build for.

Our minds don't dream of ideas it believes are impossible to implement. More leverage boosts our confidence, letting us dream wider and bigger which also increases possibilities.

An increase in leverage, by definition, increases the rate which we make decisions. When implementing an idea takes a long time, inequality between individuals doesn't show up quickly. Imagine a game of chess in which each move takes 5 years. By the time the players die, their differences wouldn't be that clear. It's not that the difference in ability wasn't there, but it didn't have enough time to present itself as a difference in productivity.

The faster we make decisions, the more decisions we make, increasing the weight of each decision as it compounds more aggressively. With greater leverage, small difference in ability (in decision making) leads to a far greater difference in productivity. A slightly better player in a long, complex, fair, game making moves rapidly will have much better results.

Since our activities are becoming more complex leading to more variance in ability, and we are making moves more quickly, small differences in ability will have larger differences in productivity.


### Predictions
- Bootcamps will find it difficult to survive unless they operate in a slower changing domain - which only delays the inevitable.
- Pay-to-learn cohort based platforms will be relegate to a niche audience of professionals, not the mainstream education market.
- The only system that will work as our activities become more complex is enabling individuals to sell equity in "themselves" in exchange for capital and mentorship.
