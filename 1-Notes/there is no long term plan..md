when you start planning ahead, you create problems:
1. the mind finds it more difficult to operate in the present moment - which is where the best work happens.
2. your subconscious begins to mold your actions to fulfill your "plan". but that plan might not be the best plan. in fact, it's almost certainly not the best plan. so, if the subconscious is biased towards fulfilling a plan, you become blind to paths that go against the plan. schlep blindnesses are terrible for those serious about seeking truth.

there are no plans. no rules. nothing. when an opportunity presents itself, go deep into it and ignore everything else. any rigidity in your approach doesn't work in a highly dynamic reality.

therefore, there is no "writing pipeline" or whatever nonsense.
