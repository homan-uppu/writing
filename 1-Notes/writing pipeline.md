### big picture philosophy
- there are no creations. only discoveries.
- inequality of outcomes is a byproduct of innovation.
	- / the power law is everywhere.
- economic growth is all we really want. - this is an important piece for myself to make sense of the system.
- nature is experimental (a study of natural selection, and how the best process that exists in nature is the scientific, experimental one).
### education / work
- how to job hunt in 2024 and beyond.
- tokenization of the individual.
- how the education system will collapse, and what will replace it.
- don’t call yourself a writer / writing is just a tool to understand and influence.
### company building
- premature prioritization.
- the best teams will work in person.
### ai
- **AGI needs to be able to seek truth** / seeking truth is the only skill.
- what we’ll need for AGI (this will be a really solid deep dive to make sense of the literature out there, compile, and present in a useful way.
- take off??
- breakthroughs in quantum computing.
- far greater data: the mapping between feelings and outputs (this needs significant elaboration).
- an ai research tool (present this as an idea).

tbh, this is my natural curiosity. my mind gravitates towards the biggest picture.
this is the only way to identify the most important thing to work on, and tackle it in the best way possible. there is no other way.

everything else will feel shallow. devoid of purpose / value.

get to the core of things.
understand deeply.
climb the right mountain.
think things through before jumping in and committing to something.

people around you aren’t going to understand you for a while (heck, i'm starting to not understand myself anymore lol). but, if you keep following this natural curiosity, i’m confident you’ll arrive at a good place. focus. don’t get side-tracked anymore. time is precious.

presentation is vv important. i want to create world class animations to represent the concepts that i’m presenting. beauty matters. make your presentations exceptionally beautiful.
