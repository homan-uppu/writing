Asymmetry exists everywhere in our modern world and is accelerating rapidly. It will penetrate every domain, and I don't believe it's possible to slow down this shift.

For many of us, rising asymmetry is making it tougher for us to get what we want out of our lives - whatever that may be. But this isn't because it's somehow more difficult to create value in the world. In fact it's easier than ever! Our difficulties stem from the fact that the habits that enabled us to get what we want in a more symmetrical world no longer help us get what want in an extremely asymmetrical world. Our understanding and habits are incredibly outdated.

A young student that doesn't understand and act according to the growing asymmetry in the world and how that impacts what the world needs in a few years will likely train themselves in ways that won't be relevant.

A startup founder that doesn't understand  and act according to the growing asymmetry will almost certainly fail to build a meaningful company - increasingly so as asymmetry rises.

...

To understand why, we need to first see what causes asymmetry, and study how it's changing.

Asymmetry is a function of complexity and leverage.

We can model the process we follow to get what we want (whatever that may be) as a game. The "winning" criteria is feeling the satiation from getting what we want. Our process involves making decisions about what to do. Each decision takes us to a point where we see more choices that we have to decide from. (1)

Therefore, this process resembles a decision tree:

<>.

Complexity is proportional to the number of possibilities in this process, or in other words, the number of possible paths you can take in this tree. More complex games have more possibilities than less complex games. (2)

Whether you want to build a great company, make an emotionally moving work of art, or even improve your relationships, the process resembles this tree because it involves making choices out of an array of choices available at any given moment in time. And each choice you make influences the choices that are available next.

The advantage of framing our endeavors as games is that we can study the nature of human endeavors by studying the nature of simpler, more well understood games, and extrapolating our learnings to the games that we play.

Let's look at three simple (relative to most of the games we play) games: Tic Tac Toe (simple game), Chess (medium complexity), and Go (high complexity).

We observe the following as the game becomes more complex:
1. There are less draws.
2. It's more difficult to become great at the game.
3. Intuition becomes a greater factor in how the best players play.
4. The difference in skill between players increases.
5. The best player is further ahead than the rest.

Asymmetry rises as the complexity of the game increases.

...

I believe the games we play to get the things we want are much, much higher in complexity than the games we discussed above, and that the complexity is actually rising. Therefore, we will see greater asymmetry moving forward.

To see why, we need to understand how the world is changing, and studying leverage is a useful way to study change.

By leverage I simply mean the time it takes to turn an idea into reality. The greater the leverage available to you, the less time it takes you to turn your ideas into reality.

Human progress increases leverage in the world. When a dictatorship is replaced by a democracy, the citizens often gain leverage because they are more free and therefore can manifest their ideas that they previously couldn't. When a new technology is created, it decreases the time and effort to implement an idea. Computers, internet, artificial intelligence, government policies, cultural changes towards greater freedom, etc. all work to increase leverage in the world. (3)

Greater leverage also means that simpler games become less valuable, and therefore the games that we play become more complex.

For example, before computers, most people involved in business spent a large chunk of their time concerned with numbers. Computers were able to solve number crunching better than we could, and therefore we had more time to spend on figuring out what products to create, how to build great teams, etc - which are all far more complex than arithmetic.

When leverage increases it often means that simpler games can be done better by technology, leaving us room to play more complex games. And the more complex the games become, the greater the asymmetry.

Yet, we would still not see great asymmetry between players playing a highly complex game if each move takes a long time to make. For example, if each move in Chess took 4 years to make, by the time the two players died, the board position probably wouldn't be too skewed one way or the other.

In other words, the longer it takes to make a move, the longer it takes for the underlying asymmetry to become visible.

Leverage decreases the time per move, and therefore exposes the underlying asymmetry quite quickly. Today, the best company founder will outpace everyone else by many orders of magnitude before they die in ways that a similarly great founder 100 years ago could not simply because each move took much longer to make.

And lastly leverage also increases the possible moves you can make even within complex games, therefore making the same game more complex. If we study the ideas we have, we'll notice that we tend to not have ideas that we subconsciously think are impossible to turn into reality. As leverage increases, our subconscious becomes more willing to dream bigger because it is more confident that those dreams can be turned into reality.

Filmmakers today have a more possibilities for the films they create. They can tell stories about far away planets, alien species, alternate realities, or whatever their imagination lets them because we can use computers, and increasingly artificial intelligence, to turn those ideas to reality. Whereas a filmmaker from a century ago was far more likely to just stick to making films set in the modern society because they had far less leverage.

Therefore leverage both increases the complexity of the games we play, and exposes the underlying asymmetry much more quickly than ever before.

As we continue to progress as a species by creating a more free world in which we have more equal opportunity, and by creating more powerful technology to more quickly turn our ideas into reality, we will accelerate towards extreme asymmetry in outcomes.

1. *Note: You may say that modeling our endeavors as games is reductive. I agree that it is, but I believe it's still directionally correct - that the lessons we extrapolate from smaller games apply to the more complex games each of us plays to get what we want.*
2. *note: there are many ways to measure game complexity, and it's an active space of research. I've tried to provide a simpler definition to work with for now which I believe to be accurate enough for the sake of our discussion, and that any better measure of complexity shouldn't change the conclusions we derive from this.*

Those incentives don't change unless the fundamental nature of the individual mind changes, and I don't see that happening anytime soon.*
