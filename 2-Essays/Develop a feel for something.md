If you want to be the best at what you do, you need to develop a feel for it.

Our activities are becoming more complex. The more complex an activity is, the more possibilities it has. A factory worker has a limited number of choices at any given moment in time, leading to few possibilities in how they assemble. An artist has an infinite number of choices and possibilities, making their work far more complex.

The more complex an activity is, the more important it is to have a feel for it in order to do well. This feeling is called "intuition": instead of thinking about what to do, you just do it instinctively.

- Steve Jobs could write a series of books on how to build a company, yet most readers will still fail.
- Joan Didion could lecture her entire life on how to write well, yet most listeners will never become great writers.
- Warren Buffet could share every thought he had about how he invests and you will still find it difficult to match his skill.

For simpler activities with fewer possibilities, you can get further by following rules. By learning the rules and some practice, you can become great at simple activities.

The more possibilities an activity has, the more choices you have. You will reach a point where you can't possibly calculate every single possibility and you will be forced to choose what you think is the best path and act on it. This is when intuition kicks in.

Our rational minds are limited. We can train them to calculate more, but there is still a limit to how much. Most valuable activities in our world are quite complex, you can't simply calculate your way to success. If you could, a computer can, or will be, able to do it better than you eventually anyway.

You can see someone's intuition in how they observe, understand, value and predict.

A startup founder with a better intuition than you, given the same news:
1. Observe different things. Their eyes will be drawn to 
2. Will understand the same observation differently.
3. Will value observations better (prioritization).
4. And they will be much better at predicting what else might be true given what they've understood. They will ask better questions.

Our activities are becoming more complex, and their complexity is accelerating upwards. Thus, intuition is becoming more important than ever.

How do you develop the right intuition?

All of us have intuitions. Even a terrible writer will have an intuition because they too observe, understand, value and predict. But their intuition sucks. It prevents them from creating work that they, and others, appreciate.

Intuition is trained by doing. But two individuals practicing a complex activity, we will find a great difference in how well they train intuition. Not all doing is the same. Two writers working just as hard for a decade will still have very different intuitions, one better than the other.

This is because intuition updates according to what you get a kick out of to enable more of that kick. Perhaps we're [not as from animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning) as we think.

The writer who gets a kick out of compliments from their publisher will develop an intuition for how to please them. The way they observe the world, how they understand observations, how they prioritize, and how they predict, whether they realize or not, will start to work to please their publisher.

The startup founder who gets a kick out of being mentioned on Twitter, will develop an intuition for how to be talked about more, instead of developing an intuition for how to create and sell a great product. 

Intuition is powerful. It's a subconscious force that will warp the way you observe, understand, value and predict in ways that you may not even notice.

It's not enough to just "do". We need to be careful about what gives us a kick. But can we even control what we get a kick out of? Perhaps, but it is difficult.

It's easy to delude ourselves into thinking that we are not getting a kick out of something when we in fact are. We're bad at observing what's happening within us. 

We crave being praised. This is a deep, evolutionary conditioning that operates in the depths of our minds without us even realizing most of the time. It's difficult to avoid the kick when someone complements you, but the degree of the kick can be controlled to an extent.

Which kicks you choose to linger on makes a big difference. Amplify kicks that are aligned with how you want to train your intuition. Fear the kicks that will turn your intuition into bias.

- A good startup founder trains intuition by celebrating a great product and happy user feedback. They fear being talked about for fundraising.
- A good writer trains intuition by celebrating when a reader gives them positive feedback. They fear the praise from their publisher when their books sell well.

Becoming anxious when you're feeling a kick that will poison your intuition is probably a healthy response to train. You won't have time to linger in the kick if you're anxious.

Build intuition by doing. Guard what gives you a kick. Become great at what you do.

### Notes

What you think is intuition can very well become a bias.

Bias and intuition are the same exact thing internally. We only call it intuition when it helps us get what we want, and bias when it doesn't. The mind doesn't label it the same way. It's all just how it observes, understands, values and predicts to give you a better kick.
