title: Develop a feel for something
date: May 2024
---
If you want to be the best at what you do, you need to develop a feel for it.

We call this "intuition": instead of calculating what to do, you are able to do it instinctively.

The more complex what you do is, the more important intuition becomes.

More complex activities have more possibilities. More possibilities means more decisions and more choices for each decision. Our minds can only reason so much. You cannot calculate your way to success in complex activities.

You can read instructions and successfully assemble furniture. No matter how many instructions you read you will need intuition to build a good business because instructions cannot represent the complexity of business.

- Steve Jobs could write a series of books on how to build a company, yet most readers will still fail.
- Joan Didion could lecture her entire life on how to write well, yet most listeners will never become great writers.
- Warren Buffet could share every thought he had about how he invests and you will still find it difficult to match his skill.

We lack their intuition.

Our world is rapidly [becoming more complex](https://jisnu.org/winners). We will need to train great intuitions to get what we want.

Intuition determines how someone observes, understands, values and predicts.

When two painters see the same painting, their eyes are drawn to different aspects in a different order. One may even observe something that the other didn’t.

When a two product managers analyze metrics for a product launch, they will understand them differently: one may becomes anxious because they feel something going wrong, while the other is happy. 

When a team is deciding between different options, given the same information, they may still value each option differently, prioritizing differently.

Two scientists who read the same paper will have different thoughts about what else could be true given these results, leading them to ask different questions, imagining different futures.

Intuition is triggered before rational thought. It shapes our thinking.

Most of our thinking is to rationalize our intuitions. We want to be able to explain why we do what we do so we don’t come off as crazy.

We are driven far more by intuition than we realize.

Intuition is trained by doing. Yet, not all doing is the same. Two students working just as hard, receiving the same training for years may still end up with very different intuitions: one much better than the other in enabling them to get what they want.

This difference is partly due to individual differences: given the same exact training we may learn differently. But, I suspect the majority of the difference comes from what gives them a “kick”: that thing that feels so good we crave for more of it.

Our mind updates intuition to get us more of that kick.

Who you spend time with is the most impactful decision you can make because we are hardwired to get massive kicks when we receive respect and praise from others. This is a deep rooted craving that is difficult to consciously observe but pervades most of our actions. Those who feel least impacted by this seem to be the most affected because they’re blind to it.

You will observe, understand, prioritize, and predict in ways that will enable you to get the kind of results your peers will praise you for.

If your peers celebrate awards, you will find yourself getting awards. If your peers value critically acclaimed, non mainstream cinema, your intuition will evolve to make such movies.

***You will end up getting what your peers want, not what you thought you wanted.***

An employee whose output is measured by their manager will develop their intuition to be praised by them, regardless of whether their manager has the right intuition about what the world actually wants. 

When they start their own company, they realize that what they thought was intuition is actually bias <FootnoteReference number={2} />.

The cost of spending time with a not-great team is far more than just the time spent: our intuitions are polluted. We will need to spend a lot more time unlearning bias. And that takes a lot longer than we expect. 

We cannot simply “think” our way out of a bias. A bias is a habit.

---

Who you spend time with is only part of the battle. When you get good enough, the world showers you with praise and awards. You will need a strong defense against this as well. If you celebrate with them, you will quickly lose the intuition that made you good.

Yet even if you don’t actively celebrate, a part of your mind still releases the kick: it’s been hardwired to do so.

It’s not easy to sustain great intuition.

---

- Build intuition by doing.
- Be paranoid about the quality of your peers.
- Guard yourself from praise that pollutes your intuition.

### Notes

<Footnotes>

<Footnote number={1}>

Intuition is a different mechanism compared to rational thought.

We should be able to see this with those who suffer from amnesia: they may not be able to remember how to think what they did before, but their intuition will remain intact. They won’t have trouble driving, etc.

If Steve Jobs had lost all memory, he would still have the “feel” for when a design is off, he just might not be able to explain it anymore. Intuition is a wiring of neurons that cannot be undone instantaneously as memory can. 

</Footnote>

<Footnote number={2}>
Bias and intuition are the same thing internally. We call it intuition when it helps us get what we want, and bias when it doesn't. The mind doesn't label it, it just wants to get a kick.
