Asymmetry exists everywhere in our modern world and is rapidly accelerating.

It's not possible to slow down this shift because it's intrinsically tied to human progress. Every single thing that we create: stories, technology, government policies, make our world more asymmetric.

Yet, we deeply crave equality, symmetry. As the world becomes more asymmetric, this craving for equality blinds us to the paths that enable us get what we want in our lives. And this delusional craving prevents us from designing our society in ways that are aligned with reality, making it tougher to build a safer, freer world for all. Our craving to see equality everywhere causes suffering for each of us and the collective.

The modern paradox is that it's easier than ever to create value in the world: we are more free, and our technology is more powerful than ever before, yet we find it more difficult than ever to create value in the world in order to afford the things that we want.

This paradox exists because our habits are misaligned with reality. Increasingly so. The habits that enabled us to get what we want in a more symmetrical (equal) world no longer help us get what want in an extremely asymmetrical world. Our habits have become outdated.

To understand why, we need to first see what causes asymmetry, understand why asymmetry is growing, what that means for our world. Then we can introspect to see how we're deluded, how that leads to us not getting what we want, and how we may retrain ourselves to be more aligned with reality.

...

Asymmetry is a function of complexity.

We can model the process we follow to get what we want (whatever that may be) as a game. The "winning" criteria is feeling the satiation from getting what we want. Our process involves making decisions about what to do. Each decision takes us to a point where we see more choices that we have to decide from. [^1]

Therefore, our process to get the things we want resembles a decision tree:

<>.

Complexity is proportional to the number of possibilities in this process, or in other words, the number of possible paths you can take in this tree. More complex games have more possibilities than less complex games. [^2]

Whether you want to build a great company, make an emotionally moving work of art, or even improve your relationships, the process you follow to get what you want resembles this tree because you make choices out of an array of choices available at any given moment in time, and each choice you make influences the choices that are available next.

The advantage of framing our endeavors as games is that we can study the nature of most human endeavors by studying the nature of simpler, more well understood games, and extrapolating those learnings to the games that we play.

Let's look at three simple (relative to most of the games we play) games: Tic Tac Toe (simple game), Chess (medium complexity), and Go (high complexity), to get a sense for how asymmetry is related to the complexity of the game.

(*todo: explain why these games differ in complexity*)

A) More complex games have a fewer percentage of moves that are equally good.

The better we get at a game, the more we realize the difference in how good moves are. When we first start out, all moves seem to be "pretty good" since we haven't yet learned the downstream consequences of a move early on.

For example, in Chess, moves and openings that were considered good before computers got good at Chess were later found to be not that great and therefore professionals discarded those moves entirely.

There is a greater asymmetry in the value of moves.

B) More complex games have a greater difference between the best and the rest.

We observe that there are fewer draws the more complex the game becomes.

Any game of tic-tac-toe between two “seasoned players” will end in a draw. Chess players at the top of their games will often draw. In Chess championships, many of the games played result in a draw. In Go there rarely if ever any draws between top players.

Another way to notice this difference is to observe the ELO ratings of professional players. ELO ratings is a way to calculate relative skills of players.

> The difference in the ratings between two players serves as a predictor of the outcome of a match. Two players with equal ratings who play against each other are expected to score an equal number of wins. A player whose rating is 100 points greater than their opponent's is expected to score 64%; if the difference is 200 points, then the expected score for the stronger player is 76%
> 
> (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system)

It's important to note that the difference in rating doesn't translate linearly to the difference in wins. Someone who is a thousand ELO rating higher than another will almost certainly win.

In Go, the difference in ELO rating of the top two players is 183 (https://www.goratings.org/en/), whereas the difference in ELO rating of the top two Chess players is 25 (https://www.chess.com/players).

The gap between the best and the next best is far greater in Go than in Chess. Meanwhile there's no need for ELO rating for Tic Tac Toe because every "professional" would draw, meaning everyone's ELO would be zero.

*Yes, there may be differences in how ELO ratings are calculated for each game, but I'm confident that even when you adjust for such differences in calculations, the argument will still hold: the more complex games will have greater asymmetry that does not grow linearly with the difference in complexity.*

C) Complex games have a wider spread of ability.

In more complex games we notice a much higher range for the ELO ratings. Meaning ability is spread more widely & the difference between the best and the average also grows. This is why the top ELO rating will be higher for more complex games.

Therefore, asymmetry increases as the complexity of the game increases.

...

The games we play today to get the things we want are much, much higher in complexity than the games we discussed above, leading to far greater asymmetry. 

Yet, complexity alone doesn't help us understand why asymmetry is growing. If the games we play have always been more complex than the board games we discussed, then why haven't we always seen a great deal of asymmetry?

The complexity of the games we play is a function of leverage. By leverage I simply mean the time it takes to turn an idea into reality. The greater the leverage available to you, the less time it takes you to turn your ideas into reality.

Any human progress increases leverage, and spreads it to more people. For example, when a dictatorship is replaced by a democracy, the citizens gain leverage because they are more free and therefore can manifest their ideas that they previously couldn't. When a new technology is created, it reduces the time and effort to turn your idea into reality. 

Computers, internet, artificial intelligence, government policies, greater individual freedom, etc. all work to increase leverage in the world. [^3]

Greater leverage increases the complexity of the games we play in three ways:
1. By reducing the time per move.
2. By eliminating the need to play simpler games (because technology does it for us).
3. By increasing the possibilities within any game, thereby making the game more complex.

When it takes a long time to make a move, the underlying asymmetry doesn't manifest quickly. Imagine a game of chess where each move took 5 years to make. By the time the players die, their differences wouldn't be that apparent. It's not that the asymmetry wasn't there, but that it didn't have enough time to present itself.  Over the past decade technology has drastically reduced the time it takes to turn an idea into reality - i.e. the time it takes to make a move.

As leverage increases, we stop playing simpler games. Before we had computers, a large amount of time and effort was involved in keep track of numbers and basic numerical calculations. As we had better technology, we were able to shift more of our time to playing more complex games: figuring out what to create and how to create it.

And lastly, games that were always complex become even more complex due to leverage. Our ideas are subconsciously limited by the leverage we have available to us because our minds don't like to dream about things that it believes are impossible. Most filmmakers a century ago likely wouldn't have dreamt of making a film about intergalactic politics, and constrained their ideas to films that could take place in the normal world. As leverage increased, filmmakers were able to dream bigger and wider. Their minds opened up to more possibilities within the same game, making the game more complex.

...

I made a claim earlier that the games we play are far more complex than Chess and Go. A good reader would have been annoyed that I offered no explanation. Even though my intuition led me to write that claim quickly, the explanation wasn't as straightforward as I initially felt it would be.

There is a hierarchy of complexity for the games, and the most complex games we play are the ones in which success is measured by how good we make people feel.

And the representational complexity of feeling is far greater than that of Chess or Go. By representational complexity I mean how easy it is to describe the state of the game at any moment in time. A game that has a much more complicated state, likely also has many more possibilities for what moves you can take, and is therefore more complex in general.

To see why, recall when you had to communicate how you felt. You'll remember how difficult it is to do so, and importantly that no matter how many words you use, you weren't able to fully, completely, represent your feeling in words. This is because a feeling has a much higher representational complexity than words. Trying to represent a feeling in words is difficult because we are trying to represent something of a higher complexity into a medium that has less complexity. Information is bound to be lost.

It's precisely this lost information that allows for the various interpretations of words. Every single person reading this essay will have different feelings as they read this. Even though my intention is to make you feel what I feel about this topic, there is absolutely no way for me to do so without any loss of information, no matter what medium I use: words, images, videos, symbols, anything - even if I spend my entire life trying. This gap is quite large.

The representational complexity of Chess and Go can easily be represented by symbols, and therefore I believe that any game in which success is measured by how good you make someone feel will be orders of magnitude more complex than Chess and Go (proportional to the difference in complexity between feeling and a sequence of symbols). Therefore, the underlying asymmetry that we are moving towards is quite extreme.

As leverage increases, we move up the complexity hierarchy to play games measured by how good you make people feel. A couple of centuries ago, most workers spent their time playing games that had nothing to do with how to make someone feel. They'd often assemble physical things in a factory. As that region progressed, they built better technology to require less workers to manufacture the same thing, and also offshored simpler work to other places, leaving workers to move up complexity towards services such as marketing, support, design, etc, which are closer to solving for how to make people feel good.

We notice this trend today as well. Programmers are being asked to become better at thinking about what to build and understanding users, without just thinking about how to build something. Animators are being asked to contribute something meaningful to the story instead of only translating a rough sketch into a completed animation. Pizza cooks, and ice cream store employees, are being asked to tell engaging stories on social media to attract more customers. Everyone is moving towards figuring out how to make people feel good.

Artists for thousands of years have been solving for how to make people feel. Which is why it's no surprise that the arts have always had extreme asymmetry. Human progress is pushing us all towards the games that artists have been playing for a long time, and also the extreme asymmetry that artists have felt for a long time.

...

We can't be satisfied with any conclusions about asymmetry without thinking about the role of fairness. The real world is not like a board game. It's not fair.

Let's imagine a fairy tale world. Every child would have loving, caring, supportive parents, wonderful teachers, the freedom to explore what they want. No one is concerned about how to make a living. Everyone has access to great healthcare, etc. 

In this imaginary world, we all have incredibly high leverage: anything we imagine can be manifested into reality quickly. Have an idea for an app? It will be built in a day according to your instructions and you can share it with the entire world. The same for a video, song, etc. Whatever you can imagine and express well enough through some mediums (language, drawing, etc.) someone or something will turn it into reality for you. In this world all you will care about is to create things that you and others want - whether that's art, better medical instruments, physical things, whatever you want.

What do you think the outcomes of this imaginary world would look like?

I believe it would be incredibly asymmetric. That the richest person in this world will be so stupidly rich that it's unfathomable to us right now. And that there would be a massive variance in outcomes across the board.

I believe this to be true because in a highly leveraged world, we have more possibilities and we make moves much quicker. Therefore, slight differences in choices at the start of the game would lead to drastic differences by the time we die, simply due to the complexity of the game.

And what we've noticed in our world is that not all explorations are equally worthwhile. Someone who spends their entire life learning how to craft the best baskets to sell to their village will not have the same outcomes as someone who developed an interest for building, say, software.

A slightly different influence that leads to a difference choice early will have incredibly large difference in where you end up. The greater the leverage, the greater the difference because the deeper in the game decision tree you can explore. 

Two twin children, that open up a social app and see two different videos are in influenced in subtly different ways. Because each decision is faster to make due to leverage, even subtle difference in influence will lead to drastic differences by the time they die.

And this isn't even taking into account the difference in our abilities at birth! If we include that, then asymmetry will be even greater. I think it's silly to think that we're not born with different capabilities, different strengths and weaknesses, different emotional reactions to the same stimuli. Nature is also a complex system - maybe even more complex than our feelings. Expecting it to produce two equal things of anything is a delusion.

Now, unfairness can also cause inequality. But the shape of the inequality caused by unfairness is fundamentally different than the shape of the inequality caused by fairness + leverage. We'll need to train ourselves to be able to differentiate.

...

Human progress makes the world more fair.

Someone born poor 2000 years ago had very little chance to move up in life. They'd likely be an indentured laborer or worse a slave. They'd have little to no freedom. They'd be unable to speak their mind against someone richer than them. There were rigid class divisions in society. 

Even a century ago, most factory workers would likely never be able to afford starting their own factory one day because their wages would never add up to be enough, and because they wouldn't have access to capital (far fewer investors). Generally only those that had wealth had the ability to create what they wanted.

Today, even in many of the poorest communities around the world, many kids have the ability to create, to speak their minds in ways their grandparents couldn't dream of, and have access to information and knowledge through the internet that is barely any less than the richest kid living in a high rise building in Manhattan.

Human progress reduces the barrier to entry and spreads it wider.

Yet, it's undeniable that the child that has access to higher quality feedback, more competent, ambitious peers, a stronger safety net, and more supportive loving parents, has an unfair advantage. While have a great deal of work to do, and we shouldn't stop pushing for a more fair world. But the world is more fair than it has ever been in modern history.

Every humanitarian effort. Every improvement in technology. Every advancement in medicine, government policy, etc. will all help us get closer to a fair world, that will simultaneously be more asymmetric, unequal.

...

Asymmetry is a function of complexity. The greater the complexity of a game, the more asymmetric the game is.

The complexity of the games we play is a function of leverage. The greater leverage that exists in the world, pushes us to play more complex games.

Leverage that exists in the world is a function of human progress. Every advancement we make in any domain pushes us towards a more fair and leveraged world.

...

Even if we intellectually agree that our games are becoming more complex, and therefore there is accelerating asymmetry, I assure you that we are all incredibly bad at acting according to this intellectual understanding. The optimal way to get what we want in this world looks very different than what we do.

Our intuitions for how to get what we want are extremely outdated because they've been shaped by a world with much lesser asymmetry. The stories we tell each other, our education systems, government policies, etc. are all still stuck in a world with far less asymmetry. And our intuitions are shaped by all of our life experiences leading to this point which are influenced greatly by the cultures we grew up in.

And this is precisely what leads to the paradox that we see in society today. There is a small fraction of individuals in this world that have found it easier than ever to get what they want because they've built the intuition for how to operate in an extremely asymmetric world, whereas those that haven't are quite vocal about how it's becoming much more difficult to get what they want (e.g. to have a nice home, affording kids, eating 3 healthy meals a day, and fulfilling basic human desires).

This paradox exists because even though it's easier than ever to manifest our ideas, create value in the world and capture that value to afford the the things we want, most of us don't have the intuition to do this well [^5]. For example: the salaries for useful jobs (e.g. software engineer) will skyrocket because there is unlimited demand for those who can operate well in such asymmetry, while yet most candidates applying for the job will be rejected and feel that the market is bad. This paradox is accelerating and will penetrate every domain as it's a direct reflection of asymmetry.

By "intuition", I mean the instinctive force that can be felt. It's a sort of muscle memory that pulls you to do things a certain way. It is not active, conscious thinking about what to do.

Because intuition exists in the realm of feeling, it's often felt as an emotion. For example, a company founder with great intuition feels appropriate fear that guides them in the right direction. They fear hiring the wrong person because they know through experience how dangerous that is, whereas a novice founder likely doesn't have the same fear, and therefore will burn themselves. [^6]

This difference in intuition is also why advice is interpreted differently. You can tell someone to be very cautious about who they hire, but unless they cultivate the intuitive emotional response to guide them, they'll invariably not internalize the advice optimally - in the way that it was intended by the person who told them.

And this is why even though we may intellectually see that the world is extremely asymmetric, we all lack the appropriate intuitive, emotional response to enable us to act optimally.

...

I believe our lack of an intuitive fear towards equality is a large factor in what holds us back. 

The less equal the world becomes, the more we suffer from our lack of fear of equality. Not only do we not fear equality, we actually crave it! To cultivate appropriate fear, we have to first undo our craving to see equality everywhere we look.

For example, a leader of a team should be incredibly alarmed when two team members are performing equally well because that means at least one of the following is true:

A. **The team members are under-leveraged**: they are playing simpler games than is possible because they aren't using tools available in the world well enough. Recent advancement in leverage certainly means that an optimal employee would have offloaded all simpler work to technology and moved up towards playing more complex tasks. And this also means that they're moving slower than they could, meaning the underlying asymmetry will take longer to be exposed. This could be for many reasons including the culture of the company, the expectations the leader has for their team, etc.

B. **The team members are not as competent as they ought to be**. Even with the appropriate leverage, if there isn't a drastic difference, it likely means that they are at the lower end of the skill spectrum. As we saw in our study of simpler games, the better the player gets, the more they separate themselves from the next best player, increasingly so. It's only at the lower end of the skill spectrum where we see greater equality.

C. **The leader is terrible at assessing performance** because if the employees are appropriately leveraged and competent, a large difference should have been apparent.

In a highly asymmetric world, teams in which members perform equally well are teams that will certainly be outcompeted, because equality is incredibly rare the more complex the games become.

Yet, in the modern workforce we celebrate when we see an entire team has equally good outputs. Remember, that was the right celebration back when we worked in factories, or when we were hunter gatherers, because in such simple games if there was not equal output, it was almost certainly because someone was slacking. Now, equal output almost certainly means something is lacking.

The intuition for when inequality is due to slacking or lacking will be invaluable.

This is one of the many, many situations in which we have lack the appropriate fear towards equality.

A parent that enrolls their child in a school should be terrified if all the children appear to be doing equally well (all achieve high test scores). Because that certainly means that test is far from assessing the skill required to thrive in today's extremely asymmetric world.

A prospective student evaluating educational programs should be terrified if they see equal outcomes for graduates. If those outcomes are jobs, then the companies then it means that the majority of the companies hiring these students are likely incredibly suboptimal and won't survive as the world becomes more asymmetric. If those outcomes are some scores, then those scores are certainly disconnected from reality, and won't matter eventually.

...

When our intuition is lacking and we want to train it, heuristics are helpful to train better habits.

One heuristic I've found helpful is to pause whenever I think something is equal, because the notion of equality is almost certainly a delusion as we're all playing quite complex games in a highly leveraged world.

We also need to be more compassionate. Evolution has hardwired us to respect less those that achieve less. This was a useful conditioning back when we were hunters & gatherers because it was likely true that if someone achieved less, they were slacking. And this fear of being perceived lesser than another pushed us to become better at doing our work, which increased the probability that our tribe survives and we pass on our genes.

This evolutionary conditioning is especially dangerous in an extremely asymmetric world because it'll make most of us incredibly unhappy. In a free world with high leverage it's likely that a friend, neighbor, or someone we know, younger, less experienced, etc. will achieve orders of magnitude greater outcomes than we do. This will become increasingly common.

In other words, jealousy was incredibly useful to grow our species, but is incredibly outdated in an extremely asymmetric world. In a hunger gatherer tribe, if you weren't jealous and didn't strive to do as well as others in your tribe, you'd likely be ostracized because there wouldn't be enough food for everyone. Yet today, jealousy primarily acts to wreak havoc on mental health with no upside.

...

I want to be clear, I believe we must still crave for equality of opportunity. That is the only craving that we must not only preserve, but cultivate. That is still the right craving to have to create a more fair, and just world. But we need to realize that equal opportunity actually creates more extreme asymmetry in outcomes, and we must accept that and build a world in alignment with this reality. 

If we don't want greater asymmetry, it also means that we don't want human progress since asymmetry is a function of leverage. It also means that we don't want people to be more free because more free people invent things that increase leverage.

I wish you the best in training yourself to thrive in an extremely asymmetric world. We all have a lot of work to do. 

In this essay I've only scratched the surface of how we ought to train ourselves to take advantage of an extremely asymmetric world. This shift has great consequences that impact every single aspect of our lives. In subsequent essays, I'll explore what those impacts are, and what we can do about it for the most important aspects.

[[I'd appreciate your feedback]] on this essay.

[^1] *Note: You may say that modeling our endeavors as games is reductive. I agree that it is, but I believe it's still directionally correct - that the lessons we extrapolate from smaller games apply to the more complex games each of us plays to get what we want.*

[^2] *note: there are many ways to measure game complexity, and it's an active space of research. I've tried to provide a simpler definition to work with for now which I believe to be accurate enough for the sake of our discussion, and that any better measure of complexity shouldn't change the conclusions we derive from this.*

[^3] *This happens due to the underlying incentives that govern a group of individuals - which is an interesting topic that I plan to dive deep into in another essay. Those incentives don't change unless the fundamental nature of the individual mind changes, and I don't see that happening anytime soon.*

[^4] *And asymmetry is accelerating exponentially because leverage increases exponentially. We can see why by looking at global gdp curve. Global GDP is a lagging indicator of leverage. It's lagging to the degree of time it takes to use the latest technology to turn an idea to reality. For example, the true economic value of what current AI technologies will bring to the world will only become apparent in a couple of years after people have actually used that technology to create value in the world. So the true leverage available in this moment will only be reflected by global gdp after some time. Yet, despite this lag, global gdp still gives us a good sense of the trajectory. Just remember to apply exponential increase when extrapolating.*

[^5] *To be clear, when I say  most of us don't have the intuition to do this, I'm not implying that everyone is in a position to get what they want even if they gain intuition quickly. That's because there is still a of work we need to do to ensure equality of opportunity. Someone in a war torn region in the world, no matter how much intuition they have, may still struggle to turn that intuition into outcomes due to circumstance. But if you're reading this it probably means that you have access to the internet, have at least a smartphone, and at least an hour of time a day to do what you want. I believe that's the minimum required to train intuition and afford what you want within a decade.*

[^6] *Contrary to popular belief that greats fear less than the rest of us, I believe all greats of their crafts actually have greater fear towards lack of growth. The better you get, the more you can see how most paths will not lead to the sort of growth you want, and the more healthy fear you develop. It's no surprise that books such as "Only the paranoid survive" were written. (Disclaimer: I haven't read the book, the title just seemed relevant.)*

(?) *Intuition is far more difficult to train than intellectual understanding. This has drastic implications on our education system, which I'll dive into in a future essay. Specifically, I believe that pay-to-learn education is outdated because it doesn't have the right incentives for an extremely asymmetric world.*
