Asymmetry exists everywhere in our modern world and is rapidly accelerating. It will penetrate every domain. 

It's not possible to slow down this shift because it's intrinsically tied to human progress. Every single thing that we create: stories, technology, policies work to make our world more asymmetric.

Yet, we deeply crave equality, symmetry. As the world becomes more asymmetric, this craving for equality blinds us to the paths that enable us get what we want in our lives. And it prevents us from designing our society in a way that's aligned with reality, preventing us from getting what we collectively want: a safer, freer, happier world.

The modern paradox is that it's easier than ever to get what you want because we have greater freedom to do and say what we want than ever before, and the technologies at our disposal are more powerful than ever before. Yet we find it difficult to do so because the habits that enabled us to get what we want in a more symmetrical (equal) world no longer help us get what want in an extremely asymmetrical world. Our understanding and habits are terribly outdated. 

Our habits are misaligned with reality.

To understand why, we need to first see what causes asymmetry, study how it's changing, and then introspect to see how our habits mislead us.

...

Asymmetry is a function of complexity and leverage.

We can model the process we follow to get what we want (whatever that may be) as a game. The "winning" criteria is feeling the satiation from getting what we want. Our process involves making decisions about what to do. Each decision takes us to a point where we see more choices that we have to decide from. [^1]

Therefore, our process to get the things we want resembles a decision tree:

<>.

Complexity is proportional to the number of possibilities in this process, or in other words, the number of possible paths you can take in this tree. More complex games have more possibilities than less complex games. [^2]

Whether you want to build a great company, make an emotionally moving work of art, or even improve your relationships, the process resembles this tree because it involves making choices out of an array of choices available at any given moment in time. And each choice you make influences the choices that are available next.

The advantage of framing our endeavors as games is that we can study the nature of human endeavors by studying the nature of simpler, more well understood games, and extrapolating those learnings to the games that we play.

Let's look at three simple (relative to most of the games we play) games: Tic Tac Toe (simple game), Chess (medium complexity), and Go (high complexity).

We observe the following as the game becomes more complex:
1. There are less draws.
2. It's more difficult to become great at the game.
3. Intuition becomes a greater factor in how the best players play.
4. The difference in skill between players increases.
5. The best player is further ahead than the rest.

Asymmetry rises as the complexity of the game increases.

...

The games we play to get the things we want are much, much higher in complexity than the games we discussed above, and the complexity of the games we play are actually rising due to leverage. Therefore, we will see increasing asymmetry proportional to increase in complexity of the games we play.

By leverage I simply mean the time it takes to turn an idea into reality. The greater the leverage available to you, the less time it takes you to turn your ideas into reality.

Human progress increases leverage available, and spreads it to more people, and more domains.

When a dictatorship is replaced by a democracy, the citizens often gain leverage because they are more free and therefore can manifest their ideas that they previously couldn't. When a new technology is created, it decreases the time and effort to implement an idea. Computers, internet, artificial intelligence, government policies, cultural changes towards greater freedom, etc. all work to increase leverage in the world. [^3]

Greater leverage also means that simpler games become less valuable for us to do because technology does it better than we can. We shift towards playing more complex games.

For example, before computers, most people involved in business spent a large chunk of their time concerned with numbers. Computers were able to solve number crunching better than we could, and therefore we had more time to spend on figuring out what products to create, how to build great teams, etc - which are all far more complex than arithmetic.

When leverage increases it often means that simpler games can be done better by technology, leaving us room to play more complex games. And the more complex the games become, the greater the asymmetry.

Yet, we would still not see great asymmetry between players playing a highly complex game if each move takes a long time to make. For example, if each move in Chess took 4 years to make, by the time the two players died, the board position probably wouldn't be too skewed one way or the other.

In other words, the longer it takes to make a move, the longer it takes for the underlying asymmetry between players to become visible.

Leverage decreases the time per move, and therefore exposes the underlying asymmetry quite quickly. Today, the best company founder will outpace everyone else by many orders of magnitude before they die in ways that a similarly great founder 100 years ago could not simply because each move took much longer to make.

And lastly leverage also increases the possible moves you can make even within complex games, therefore making the same game more complex. If we study the ideas we have, we'll notice that we tend to not have ideas that we subconsciously think are impossible to turn into reality. As leverage increases, our subconscious becomes more willing to dream bigger because it is more confident that those dreams can be turned into reality.

Filmmakers today have a more possibilities for the films they create. They can tell stories about far away planets, alien species, alternate realities, or whatever their imagination lets them because we can use computers, and increasingly artificial intelligence, to turn those ideas to reality. Whereas a filmmaker from a century ago was far more likely to just stick to making films set in the modern society because they had far less leverage.

Therefore leverage both increases the complexity of the games we play, and exposes the underlying asymmetry much more quickly than ever before. As we continue to progress as a species by creating a more free world in which we have more equal opportunity, and by creating more powerful technology to more quickly turn our ideas into reality, we will accelerate exponentially fast towards extreme asymmetry in outcomes. [^4]

...

I made a claim earlier that the games we play are far more complex than chess and go. A good reader would have paused. Even though my intuition led me to write that claim when I first thought of it, the explanation wasn't as straightforward as I had thought it would be.

The games we play are becoming more complex because they are trending towards making us feel a certain way. For example, most jobs in the 1960's involved performing tasks that were not measured by how well they made someone feel. Yet today, many more people are in the business of figuring out how to make people feel good. 

(*todo: the evidence needs to be stronger -> this following line specifically.*) Artists make people feel through their art. Businesses try to make people feel good through their products - after all if solving someone's problem didn't make them feel better, you haven't really solved it.

And our feelings are far, far more complex than games like Chess or Go, leading to far greater asymmetry in the world than we see in Chess or Go. 

To see why, think back to the times when you've tried to communicate how you felt about something. The difficulty in putting a feeling into words (or any medium for that matter) shows how a feeling has a higher representational complexity than words, symbols, pictures, videos, etc. Because Chess / Go positions can easily be represented in words / symbols, we know they haven't reached the complexity of feelings. (*I don't believe we will be able to represent feelings as a sequence of symbols anytime soon because the representational complexity of feelings is so high that the complexity of symbols doesn't grow fast enough. It's a scaling problem and precisely the problem we'll need to tackle in order to get AGI that reaches human level ability. AGI is a scaling problem. I believe we will need to invent many more technologies before we achieve it.*).

...

Even if we intellectually agree that our games are becoming more complex, and therefore there is accelerating asymmetry, I assure you that we are all incredibly bad at acting according to this intellectual understanding. The optimal way to get what we want in this world looks very different than what we do.

Our intuitions for how to get what we want are extremely outdated because they've been shaped by a world with much lesser asymmetry. The stories we tell each other, our education systems, government policies, etc. are all still stuck in a world with far less asymmetry. And our intuitions are shaped by all of our life experiences leading to this point which are influenced greatly by the cultures we grew up in.

And this is precisely what leads to the paradox that we see in society today. There is a small fraction of individuals in this world that have found it easier than ever to get what they want because they've built the intuition for how to operate in an extremely asymmetric world, whereas those that haven't are quite vocal about how it's becoming much more difficult to get what they want (e.g. to have a nice home, affording kids, eating 3 healthy meals a day, and fulfilling basic human desires).

This paradox exists because even though it's easier than ever to manifest our ideas, create value in the world and capture that value to afford the the things we want, most of us don't have the intuition to do this well [^5]. For example: the salaries for useful jobs (e.g. software engineer) will skyrocket because there is unlimited demand for those who can operate well in such asymmetry, while yet most candidates applying for the job will be rejected and feel that the market is bad. This paradox is accelerating and will penetrate every domain as it's a direct reflection of asymmetry.

By "intuition", I mean the instinctive force that can be felt. It's a sort of muscle memory that pulls you to do things a certain way. It is not active, conscious thinking about what to do.

Because intuition exists in the realm of feeling, it's often felt as an emotion. For example, a company founder with great intuition feels appropriate fear that guides them in the right direction. They fear hiring the wrong person because they know through experience how dangerous that is, whereas a novice founder likely doesn't have the same fear, and therefore will burn themselves. [^6]

This difference in intuition is also why advice is interpreted differently. You can tell someone to be very cautious about who they hire, but unless they cultivate the intuitive emotional response to guide them, they'll invariably not internalize the advice optimally - in the way that it was intended by the person who told them.

And this is why even though we may intellectually see that the world is extremely asymmetric, we all lack the appropriate intuitive, emotional response to enable us to act optimally.

...

I believe our lack of an intuitive fear towards equality is a large factor in what holds us back. 

The less equal the world becomes, the more we suffer from our lack of fear of equality. Not only do we not fear equality, we actually crave it! To cultivate appropriate fear, we have to first undo our craving to see equality everywhere we look.

For example, a leader of a team should be incredibly alarmed when two team members are performing equally well because that means at least one of the following is true:

A. **The team members are under-leveraged**: they are playing simpler games than is possible because they aren't using tools available in the world well enough. Recent advancement in leverage certainly means that an optimal employee would have offloaded all simpler work to technology and moved up towards playing more complex tasks. And this also means that they're moving slower than they could, meaning the underlying asymmetry will take longer to be exposed. This could be for many reasons including the culture of the company, the expectations the leader has for their team, etc.

B. **The team members are not as competent as they ought to be**. Even with the appropriate leverage, if there isn't a drastic difference, it likely means that they are at the lower end of the skill spectrum. As we saw in our study of simpler games, the better the player gets, the more they separate themselves from the next best player, increasingly so. It's only at the lower end of the skill spectrum where we see greater equality.

C. **The leader is terrible at assessing performance** because if the employees are appropriately leveraged and competent, a large difference should have been apparent.

In a highly asymmetric world, teams in which members perform equally well are teams that will certainly be outcompeted, because equality is incredibly rare the more complex the games become.

Yet, in the modern workforce we celebrate when we see an entire team has equally good outputs. Remember, that was the right celebration back when we worked in factories, or when we were hunter gatherers, because in such simple games if there was not equal output, it was almost certainly because someone was slacking. Now, equal output almost certainly means something is lacking.

The intuition for when inequality is due to slacking or lacking will be invaluable.

...

This is one of many, many situations in which we have lack the appropriate fear towards equality.

A parent that enrolls their child in a school should be terrified if all the children appear to be doing equally well (all achieve high test scores). Because that certainly means that test is far from assessing the skill required to thrive in today's extremely asymmetric world.

A prospective student evaluating educational programs should be terrified if they see equal outcomes for graduates. If those outcomes are jobs, then the companies then it means that the majority of the companies hiring these students are likely incredibly suboptimal and won't survive as the world becomes more asymmetric. If those outcomes are some scores, then those scores are certainly disconnected from reality.

I'll explore the most important ones in subsequent essays.

...

When our intuition is lacking and we want to train it, heuristics are helpful to train better habits.

One heuristic I've found helpful is to pause whenever I think something is equal, because the notion of equality is almost certainly a delusion as we're all playing quite complex games in a highly leveraged world.

I also believe we ought to cultivate greater compassion. Evolution has hardwired us to respect less those that achieve less. This may have been a useful conditioning back when we were hunters, etc. because it was likely true that if someone achieved less, they were slacking. And this fear of being perceived lesser than another pushed us to become better at doing our work, which increases the probability that our tribe survived and we could pass on our genes.

This evolutionary conditioning is especially dangerous in an extremely asymmetric world because it'll make most of us incredibly unhappy. In a free world with high leverage it's likely that a friend, neighbor, or someone we know, younger, less experienced, etc. will achieve orders of magnitude greater outcomes than we do. This will become increasingly common.

In other words, jealousy was incredibly useful to grow our species, but is incredibly outdated in an extremely asymmetric world. In a hunger gatherer tribe, if you weren't jealous and didn't strive to do as well as others in your tribe, you'd likely be ostracized because there wouldn't be enough food for everyone. Yet today, jealousy primarily acts to wreak havoc on mental health with no upside.

...

I want to be clear, I believe we must still crave for equality of opportunity. That is the only craving that we must not only preserve, but cultivate. That is still the right craving to have to create a more fair, and just world. But we need to realize that equal opportunity actually creates more extreme asymmetry in outcomes, and we must accept that and build a world in alignment with this reality. 

If we don't want greater asymmetry, it also means that we don't want human progress since asymmetry is a function of leverage. It also means that we don't want people to be more free because more free people invent things that increase leverage.

I wish you the best in training yourself to thrive in an extremely asymmetric world. We all have a lot of work to do. 

In this essay I've only scratched the surface of how we ought to train ourselves to take advantage of an extremely asymmetric world. This shift has great consequences that impact every single aspect of our lives. In subsequent essays, I'll explore what those impacts are, and what we can do about it for the most important aspects.

[^1] *Note: You may say that modeling our endeavors as games is reductive. I agree that it is, but I believe it's still directionally correct - that the lessons we extrapolate from smaller games apply to the more complex games each of us plays to get what we want.*

[^2] *note: there are many ways to measure game complexity, and it's an active space of research. I've tried to provide a simpler definition to work with for now which I believe to be accurate enough for the sake of our discussion, and that any better measure of complexity shouldn't change the conclusions we derive from this.*

[^3] *This happens due to the underlying incentives that govern a group of individuals - which is an interesting topic that I plan to dive deep into in another essay. Those incentives don't change unless the fundamental nature of the individual mind changes, and I don't see that happening anytime soon.*

[^4] *And asymmetry is accelerating exponentially because leverage increases exponentially. We can see why by looking at global gdp curve. Global GDP is a lagging indicator of leverage. It's lagging to the degree of time it takes to use the latest technology to turn an idea to reality. For example, the true economic value of what current AI technologies will bring to the world will only become apparent in a couple of years after people have actually used that technology to create value in the world. So the true leverage available in this moment will only be reflected by global gdp after some time. Yet, despite this lag, global gdp still gives us a good sense of the trajectory. Just remember to apply exponential increase when extrapolating.*

[^5] *To be clear, when I say  most of us don't have the intuition to do this, I'm not implying that everyone is in a position to get what they want even if they gain intuition quickly. That's because there is still a of work we need to do to ensure equality of opportunity. Someone in a war torn region in the world, no matter how much intuition they have, may still struggle to turn that intuition into outcomes due to circumstance. But if you're reading this it probably means that you have access to the internet, have at least a smartphone, and at least an hour of time a day to do what you want. I believe that's the minimum required to train intuition and afford what you want within a decade.*

[^6] *Contrary to popular belief that greats fear less than the rest of us, I believe all greats of their crafts actually have greater fear towards lack of growth. The better you get, the more you can see how most paths will not lead to the sort of growth you want, and the more healthy fear you develop. It's no surprise that books such as "Only the paranoid survive" were written. (Disclaimer: I haven't read the book, the title just seemed relevant.)*


(?) *Intuition is far more difficult to train than intellectual understanding. This has drastic implications on our education system, which I'll dive into in a future essay. Specifically, I believe that pay-to-learn education is outdated because it doesn't have the right incentives for an extremely asymmetric world.*
