Asymmetry exists everywhere in our modern world and is rapidly accelerating.

It's not possible to slow down this shift because it's intrinsically tied to human progress. Every single thing that we create: stories, technology, government policies, make our world more asymmetric.

Yet, we deeply crave equality, symmetry. As the world becomes more asymmetric, this craving for equality blinds us to the paths that enable us get what we want in our lives. And this delusional craving prevents us from designing our society in ways that are aligned with reality, making it tougher to build a safer, freer world for all. Our craving to see equality everywhere causes suffering for each of us and the collective.

The modern paradox is that it's easier than ever to create value in the world: we are more free, and our technology is more powerful than ever before, yet we find it more difficult than ever to create value in the world in order to afford the things that we want.

This paradox exists because our habits are misaligned with reality. Increasingly so. The habits that enabled us to get what we want in a more symmetrical (equal) world no longer help us get what want in an extremely asymmetrical world. Our habits have become outdated.

To understand why, we need to first see what causes asymmetry, understand why asymmetry is growing, what that means for our world. Then we can introspect to see how we're deluded, how that leads to us not getting what we want, and how we may retrain ourselves to be more aligned with reality.

...

Asymmetry is a function of complexity and leverage.

We can model the process we follow to get what we want (whatever that may be) as a game. The "winning" criteria is feeling the satiation from getting what we want. Our process involves making decisions about what to do. Each decision takes us to a point where we see more choices that we have to decide from. [^1]

Therefore, our process to get the things we want resembles a decision tree:

<>.

Complexity is proportional to the number of possibilities in this process, or in other words, the number of possible paths you can take in this tree. More complex games have more possibilities than less complex games. [^2]

Whether you want to build a great company, make an emotionally moving work of art, or even improve your relationships, the process you follow to get what you want resembles this tree because you make choices out of an array of choices available at any given moment in time, and each choice you make influences the choices that are available next.

The advantage of framing our endeavors as games is that we can study the nature of most human endeavors by studying the nature of simpler, more well understood games, and extrapolating those learnings to the games that we play.

Let's look at three simple (relative to most of the games we play) games: Tic Tac Toe (simple game), Chess (medium complexity), and Go (high complexity), to get a sense for how asymmetry is related to the complexity of the game.

(*todo: explain why these games differ in complexity*)

**More complex games have a fewer percentage of moves that are equally good.**

The better we get at a game, the more we realize the difference in how good moves are. When we first start out, all moves seem to be "pretty good" since we haven't yet learned the downstream consequences of a move early on.

For example, in Chess, moves and openings that were considered good before computers got good at Chess were later found to be not that great and therefore professionals discarded those moves entirely.

There is a greater asymmetry in the value of moves.

**More complex games have a greater difference between the best and the rest**

We observe that there are fewer draws the more complex the game becomes.

Any game of tic-tac-toe between two “seasoned players” will end in a draw. Chess players at the top of their games will often draw. In Chess championships, many of the games played result in a draw. In Go there rarely if ever any draws between top players.

Another way to notice this difference is to observe the ELO ratings of professional players. ELO ratings is a way to calculate relative skills of players.

> The difference in the ratings between two players serves as a predictor of the outcome of a match. Two players with equal ratings who play against each other are expected to score an equal number of wins. A player whose rating is 100 points greater than their opponent's is expected to score 64%; if the difference is 200 points, then the expected score for the stronger player is 76%
> 
> (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system)

It's important to note that the difference in rating doesn't translate linearly to the difference in wins. Someone who is a thousand ELO rating higher than another will almost certainly win.

In Go, the difference in ELO rating of the top two players is 183 (https://www.goratings.org/en/), whereas the difference in ELO rating of the top two Chess players is 25 (https://www.chess.com/players).

The gap between the best and the next best is far greater in Go than in Chess. Meanwhile there's no need for ELO rating for Tic Tac Toe because every "professional" would draw, meaning everyone's ELO would be zero.

*Yes, there may be differences in how ELO ratings are calculated for each game, but I'm confident that even when you adjust for such differences in calculations, the argument will still hold: the more complex games will have greater asymmetry that does not grow linearly with the difference in complexity.*

**Complex games have a wider spread of ability**

In more complex games we notice a much higher range for the ELO ratings. Meaning ability is spread more widely & the difference between the best and the average also grows. This is why the top ELO rating will be higher for more complex games.

Therefore, asymmetry increases as the complexity of the game increases.

...

The games we play to get the things we want are much, much higher in complexity than the games we discussed above, leading to far greater asymmetry. The complexity of the games we play is also rising due to leverage, causing asymmetry to increase in proportion.

By leverage I simply mean the time it takes to turn an idea into reality. The greater the leverage available to you, the less time it takes you to turn your ideas into reality.

Human progress increases leverage and spreads it to more people & domains.

For example, when a dictatorship is replaced by a democracy, the citizens often gain leverage because they are more free and therefore can manifest their ideas that they previously couldn't. They have greater leverage.  When a new technology is created, it reduces the time and effort to turn your idea into reality. 

Computers, internet, artificial intelligence, government policies, greater individual freedom, etc. all work to increase leverage in the world. [^3]

Greater leverage also means that simpler games become less valuable for us to do because technology does it better than we can. We shift towards playing more complex games.

For example, before computers, most people involved in business spent a large chunk of their time calculating numbers on paper. Computers were able to do number crunching better than we could, and therefore we had more time to spend on figuring out what products to create, how to build great teams, etc - which are all far more complex than number calculation.

Yet, we would still not see great asymmetry between players playing a highly complex game if each move takes a long time to make. For example, if each move in Chess took 4 years to make, by the time the two players died, the board position probably wouldn't be too skewed one way or the other.

In other words, the longer it takes to make a move, the longer it takes for the underlying asymmetry between players to become visible.

Leverage decreases the time per move, and therefore exposes the underlying asymmetry quite quickly. Today, the best company founder will outpace everyone else by many orders of magnitude before they die in ways that a similarly great founder 100 years ago could not simply because each move took much longer to make.

And lastly, leverage also increases the possible moves you can make even within complex games, therefore making the same game more complex. If we study the ideas we have, we'll notice that we tend to not have ideas that we subconsciously think are impossible to turn into reality. As leverage increases, our subconscious becomes more willing to dream bigger because it is more confident that those dreams can be turned into reality.

Filmmakers today have a more possibilities for the films they create. They can tell stories about far away planets, alien species, alternate realities, or whatever their imagination lets them because they can use computers, and artificial intelligence, to turn those ideas to reality in a reasonable amount of time. Whereas a filmmaker from a century ago was far more likely to just stick to making films set in the modern society that took 

Therefore leverage both increases the complexity of the games we play, and exposes the underlying asymmetry much more quickly than ever before.

...

I made a claim earlier that the games we play are far more complex than Chess and Go. A good reader would have paused and asked why. Even though my intuition led me to write that claim when I first thought of it, the explanation wasn't as straightforward as I had felt it would be.

The games we play are becoming more complex because they are trending towards making us feel a certain way. For example, most jobs in the 1960's involved performing tasks that were not measured by how well they made someone feel. Yet today, many more people are in the business of figuring out how to make people feel good. 

(*todo: the evidence needs to be stronger -> this following line specifically.*) Artists make people feel through their art. Businesses try to make people feel good through their products - after all if solving someone's problem didn't make them feel better, you haven't really solved it.

And our feelings are far, far more complex than games like Chess or Go, leading to far greater asymmetry in the world than we see in Chess or Go. 

To see why, think back to the times when you've tried to communicate how you felt about something. The difficulty in representing a feeling in words (or any medium for that matter) shows how a feeling has a higher representational complexity than words, symbols, pictures, videos, etc. This why the same sentence is interpreted in as many ways as the number of readers. 

We do not yet have a medium that perfectly represents what we feel.

Yet, Chess & Go positions can easily be represented in words / symbols, which is why I believe that they're far from matching complexity of feelings. 

(*I don't believe we will be able to represent feelings as a sequence of symbols anytime soon because the representational complexity of feelings is so high that the complexity of symbols doesn't grow fast enough. It's a scaling problem and precisely the problem we'll need to tackle in order to get AGI that reaches human level ability. AGI is a scaling problem. I believe we will need to invent many more technologies before we achieve it.*).

...

Still, we can't accept that asymmetry and inequality are bound to rise without discussing fairness.

The world is different than board games in that fairness is not equally distributed. In Chess, if it were the case that a player had 10x the time on the clock to make their moves, then naturally the one with more time would likely win - given they've both had intensive professional training for their entire lives.

But, counterintuitively, an unfair world is also more equal than a fair one. We can sniff out unfairness by seeing how much equality there is in the entire system.

For example:

In a world with greater equality of outcomes, an outlier is more likely a result of unfairness.
In a world with greater inequality of outcomes, an outlier is more likely a result of fairness.

This can be true while it's also true that upward mobility is more difficult. But the reason is that upward mobility is more difficult because we have outdated habits, not because of unfairness. The level of unfairness is decreasing as a function of leverage (may need to substantiate).

(*Fairness has nothing to do with luck. It could be possible that someone finds themselves at the right place at the right time for some reason. That is very different than saying that there is inherent unfairness in the game. I'll explore in a later essay luck vs. skill, but a more fair world will lead to greater asymmetry.*)

...

...

Even if we intellectually agree that our games are becoming more complex, and therefore there is accelerating asymmetry, I assure you that we are all incredibly bad at acting according to this intellectual understanding. The optimal way to get what we want in this world looks very different than what we do.

Our intuitions for how to get what we want are extremely outdated because they've been shaped by a world with much lesser asymmetry. The stories we tell each other, our education systems, government policies, etc. are all still stuck in a world with far less asymmetry. And our intuitions are shaped by all of our life experiences leading to this point which are influenced greatly by the cultures we grew up in.

And this is precisely what leads to the paradox that we see in society today. There is a small fraction of individuals in this world that have found it easier than ever to get what they want because they've built the intuition for how to operate in an extremely asymmetric world, whereas those that haven't are quite vocal about how it's becoming much more difficult to get what they want (e.g. to have a nice home, affording kids, eating 3 healthy meals a day, and fulfilling basic human desires).

This paradox exists because even though it's easier than ever to manifest our ideas, create value in the world and capture that value to afford the the things we want, most of us don't have the intuition to do this well [^5]. For example: the salaries for useful jobs (e.g. software engineer) will skyrocket because there is unlimited demand for those who can operate well in such asymmetry, while yet most candidates applying for the job will be rejected and feel that the market is bad. This paradox is accelerating and will penetrate every domain as it's a direct reflection of asymmetry.

By "intuition", I mean the instinctive force that can be felt. It's a sort of muscle memory that pulls you to do things a certain way. It is not active, conscious thinking about what to do.

Because intuition exists in the realm of feeling, it's often felt as an emotion. For example, a company founder with great intuition feels appropriate fear that guides them in the right direction. They fear hiring the wrong person because they know through experience how dangerous that is, whereas a novice founder likely doesn't have the same fear, and therefore will burn themselves. [^6]

This difference in intuition is also why advice is interpreted differently. You can tell someone to be very cautious about who they hire, but unless they cultivate the intuitive emotional response to guide them, they'll invariably not internalize the advice optimally - in the way that it was intended by the person who told them.

And this is why even though we may intellectually see that the world is extremely asymmetric, we all lack the appropriate intuitive, emotional response to enable us to act optimally.

...

I believe our lack of an intuitive fear towards equality is a large factor in what holds us back. 

The less equal the world becomes, the more we suffer from our lack of fear of equality. Not only do we not fear equality, we actually crave it! To cultivate appropriate fear, we have to first undo our craving to see equality everywhere we look.

For example, a leader of a team should be incredibly alarmed when two team members are performing equally well because that means at least one of the following is true:

A. **The team members are under-leveraged**: they are playing simpler games than is possible because they aren't using tools available in the world well enough. Recent advancement in leverage certainly means that an optimal employee would have offloaded all simpler work to technology and moved up towards playing more complex tasks. And this also means that they're moving slower than they could, meaning the underlying asymmetry will take longer to be exposed. This could be for many reasons including the culture of the company, the expectations the leader has for their team, etc.

B. **The team members are not as competent as they ought to be**. Even with the appropriate leverage, if there isn't a drastic difference, it likely means that they are at the lower end of the skill spectrum. As we saw in our study of simpler games, the better the player gets, the more they separate themselves from the next best player, increasingly so. It's only at the lower end of the skill spectrum where we see greater equality.

C. **The leader is terrible at assessing performance** because if the employees are appropriately leveraged and competent, a large difference should have been apparent.

In a highly asymmetric world, teams in which members perform equally well are teams that will certainly be outcompeted, because equality is incredibly rare the more complex the games become.

Yet, in the modern workforce we celebrate when we see an entire team has equally good outputs. Remember, that was the right celebration back when we worked in factories, or when we were hunter gatherers, because in such simple games if there was not equal output, it was almost certainly because someone was slacking. Now, equal output almost certainly means something is lacking.

The intuition for when inequality is due to slacking or lacking will be invaluable.

This is one of the many, many situations in which we have lack the appropriate fear towards equality.

A parent that enrolls their child in a school should be terrified if all the children appear to be doing equally well (all achieve high test scores). Because that certainly means that test is far from assessing the skill required to thrive in today's extremely asymmetric world.

A prospective student evaluating educational programs should be terrified if they see equal outcomes for graduates. If those outcomes are jobs, then the companies then it means that the majority of the companies hiring these students are likely incredibly suboptimal and won't survive as the world becomes more asymmetric. If those outcomes are some scores, then those scores are certainly disconnected from reality.

...

When our intuition is lacking and we want to train it, heuristics are helpful to train better habits.

One heuristic I've found helpful is to pause whenever I think something is equal, because the notion of equality is almost certainly a delusion as we're all playing quite complex games in a highly leveraged world.

We also need to be more compassionate. Evolution has hardwired us to respect less those that achieve less. This was a useful conditioning back when we were hunters & gatherers because it was likely true that if someone achieved less, they were slacking. And this fear of being perceived lesser than another pushed us to become better at doing our work, which increased the probability that our tribe survives and we pass on our genes.

This evolutionary conditioning is especially dangerous in an extremely asymmetric world because it'll make most of us incredibly unhappy. In a free world with high leverage it's likely that a friend, neighbor, or someone we know, younger, less experienced, etc. will achieve orders of magnitude greater outcomes than we do. This will become increasingly common.

In other words, jealousy was incredibly useful to grow our species, but is incredibly outdated in an extremely asymmetric world. In a hunger gatherer tribe, if you weren't jealous and didn't strive to do as well as others in your tribe, you'd likely be ostracized because there wouldn't be enough food for everyone. Yet today, jealousy primarily acts to wreak havoc on mental health with no upside.

...

I want to be clear, I believe we must still crave for equality of opportunity. That is the only craving that we must not only preserve, but cultivate. That is still the right craving to have to create a more fair, and just world. But we need to realize that equal opportunity actually creates more extreme asymmetry in outcomes, and we must accept that and build a world in alignment with this reality. 

If we don't want greater asymmetry, it also means that we don't want human progress since asymmetry is a function of leverage. It also means that we don't want people to be more free because more free people invent things that increase leverage.

I wish you the best in training yourself to thrive in an extremely asymmetric world. We all have a lot of work to do. 

In this essay I've only scratched the surface of how we ought to train ourselves to take advantage of an extremely asymmetric world. This shift has great consequences that impact every single aspect of our lives. In subsequent essays, I'll explore what those impacts are, and what we can do about it for the most important aspects.

[[I'd appreciate your feedback]] on this essay.

[^1] *Note: You may say that modeling our endeavors as games is reductive. I agree that it is, but I believe it's still directionally correct - that the lessons we extrapolate from smaller games apply to the more complex games each of us plays to get what we want.*

[^2] *note: there are many ways to measure game complexity, and it's an active space of research. I've tried to provide a simpler definition to work with for now which I believe to be accurate enough for the sake of our discussion, and that any better measure of complexity shouldn't change the conclusions we derive from this.*

[^3] *This happens due to the underlying incentives that govern a group of individuals - which is an interesting topic that I plan to dive deep into in another essay. Those incentives don't change unless the fundamental nature of the individual mind changes, and I don't see that happening anytime soon.*

[^4] *And asymmetry is accelerating exponentially because leverage increases exponentially. We can see why by looking at global gdp curve. Global GDP is a lagging indicator of leverage. It's lagging to the degree of time it takes to use the latest technology to turn an idea to reality. For example, the true economic value of what current AI technologies will bring to the world will only become apparent in a couple of years after people have actually used that technology to create value in the world. So the true leverage available in this moment will only be reflected by global gdp after some time. Yet, despite this lag, global gdp still gives us a good sense of the trajectory. Just remember to apply exponential increase when extrapolating.*

[^5] *To be clear, when I say  most of us don't have the intuition to do this, I'm not implying that everyone is in a position to get what they want even if they gain intuition quickly. That's because there is still a of work we need to do to ensure equality of opportunity. Someone in a war torn region in the world, no matter how much intuition they have, may still struggle to turn that intuition into outcomes due to circumstance. But if you're reading this it probably means that you have access to the internet, have at least a smartphone, and at least an hour of time a day to do what you want. I believe that's the minimum required to train intuition and afford what you want within a decade.*

[^6] *Contrary to popular belief that greats fear less than the rest of us, I believe all greats of their crafts actually have greater fear towards lack of growth. The better you get, the more you can see how most paths will not lead to the sort of growth you want, and the more healthy fear you develop. It's no surprise that books such as "Only the paranoid survive" were written. (Disclaimer: I haven't read the book, the title just seemed relevant.)*

(?) *Intuition is far more difficult to train than intellectual understanding. This has drastic implications on our education system, which I'll dive into in a future essay. Specifically, I believe that pay-to-learn education is outdated because it doesn't have the right incentives for an extremely asymmetric world.*
