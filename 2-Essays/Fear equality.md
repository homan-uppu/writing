Asymmetry exists everywhere in our modern world and is rapidly accelerating.

It's not possible to slow down this shift because it's intrinsically tied to human progress. Every single thing that we create: stories, technology, government policies, make our world more asymmetric.

Yet, we deeply crave equality, symmetry. As the world becomes more asymmetric, this craving for equality blinds us to the paths that enable us get what we want in our lives.

The modern paradox is that it's easier than ever to create value in the world: we are more free, and our technology is more powerful than ever before, yet we find it more difficult than ever to create value in the world in order to afford the things that we want.

This paradox exists because our habits are misaligned with reality. Increasingly so. The habits that enabled us to get what we want in a more symmetrical (equal) world no longer help us get what want in an extremely asymmetrical world. 

Our habits are terribly outdated.

To understand why, we need to first see what causes asymmetry, understand why asymmetry is growing, and what that means for our world. Then we can introspect to see how we're deluded, how that leads to us not getting what we want, and how we may retrain ourselves to be more aligned with reality.

...

We can model the process we follow to get what we want (whatever that may be) as a game. The "winning" criteria is feeling the satiation from getting what we want and our process resembles a tree. Each decision we make leads to more decisions that have to be made. [^1]

Whether you want to build a great company, make an emotionally moving work of art, or even improve your relationships, the process you follow to get what you want resembles a decision tree. When you learn that something doesn't work you backtrack and go down a different branch. When something works you continue going down that branch.

The advantage of framing our endeavors as games is that we can study the nature of most human endeavors by studying the nature of simpler, more well understood games, and extrapolating those learnings to the games that we play.

Games have a notion of "complexity". While there are many ways to calculate complexity of a game it boils down to how many possibilities exist in the game. In a simple game there are only so many different moves a player can make, and only so many states that a player can end up in. More complex games have more moves (choices), more states, and therefore more possibilities.

Complexity is important for us to understand because asymmetry is a function of complexity. *The greater the complexity of the game, the greater the asymmetry that exists in the game.*

Let's look at three simple (relative to most of the games we play) games: Tic Tac Toe (simple game), Chess (medium complexity), and Go (high complexity), to get a sense for how asymmetry is related to the complexity of the game.

There are two ways we can observe asymmetry in these games:
1. Asymmetry in the moves (inputs).
2. Asymmetry in the outcomes (output).

For a given state of a game, each move you can take at from that state has a notion of "value". The higher the value of the move, the better it is.

By greater asymmetry in the moves, I mean that the range of values of the moves from any given state is greater, and also the difference between the best move and the next best move is greater.

For example, in Tic Tac Toe, between two trained players, there is only one possible value for each move: 0 - since two trained players in Tic Tac Toe will always draw.

Chess has a greater range of values than Tic Tac Toe, and Go has an even greater range due to its higher complexity.

The greater asymmetry in outcomes follows from the greater asymmetry of moves. The difference between the best player and the second best player grows as the complexity of the game increases.

We can study this by analyzing the ELO ratings of professional players. ELO is a way to calculate relative skills of players:

> The difference in the ratings between two players serves as a predictor of the outcome of a match. Two players with equal ratings who play against each other are expected to score an equal number of wins. A player whose rating is 100 points greater than their opponent's is expected to score 64%; if the difference is 200 points, then the expected score for the stronger player is 76%
> 
> (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system)

It's important to note that the difference in rating doesn't translate linearly to the difference in wins. Someone who is a thousand ELO rating higher than another will almost certainly win.

In Go, the difference in ELO rating of the top two players is 183 (https://www.goratings.org/en/), whereas the difference in ELO rating of the top two Chess players is 25 (https://www.chess.com/players).

The gap between the best and the next best is far greater in Go than in Chess. Meanwhile there's no need for ELO rating for Tic Tac Toe because every "professional" would draw, meaning everyone's ELO would be zero.

Asymmetry is not linear. The gap between the best player and the 2nd best player is larger than the gap between the 2nd best player and the 3rd best, and so on. The greater the complexity of the game, the greater the gap between the best and the rest, and the more skewed the curve looks.

And we can observe this fact in the ELO ratings of the games above. The difference between the 2nd and 3rd best players is lesser than the difference between the best and the 2nd best. And so on.

Lastly, we should notice that the more complex the game becomes, outcomes (i.e. ELO ratings) only become more equal the further you go towards worse players. In other words, when two professionals are equally good it means that they're not close to the best player.

Therefore, as the complexity of the game increases so does the asymmetry of the values of moves, as well as the asymmetry in outcomes. And the change in asymmetry that we observe when we move from a lower complexity game to a higher one isn't a linear change.
...

The games we play today to get the things we want are much, much higher in complexity than the games we discussed above, leading to far greater asymmetry. 

Yet, complexity alone doesn't help us understand why asymmetry is growing. If the games we play have always been more complex than the board games we discussed, then why haven't we always seen a great deal of asymmetry?

The complexity of the games we play is a function of leverage. By leverage I mean: the time it takes to turn an idea into reality. The greater the leverage available to you, the less time it takes you to turn your ideas into reality.

Any human progress increases leverage, and spreads it to more people. For example, when a dictatorship is replaced by a democracy, the citizens gain leverage because they are more free and therefore can manifest their ideas that they previously couldn't. When a new technology is created, it reduces the time and effort to turn your idea into reality. 

Computers, internet, artificial intelligence, government policies, greater individual freedom, etc. all work to increase leverage in the world. [^3]

Greater leverage increases the complexity of the games we play in three ways:
1. By reducing the time per move.
2. By eliminating the need to play simpler games (because technology does it for us).
3. By increasing the possibilities within any game, thereby making the game more complex.

When it takes a long time to make a move, the underlying asymmetry doesn't manifest quickly. Imagine a game of chess where each move took 5 years to make. By the time the players die, their differences wouldn't be that apparent. It's not that the asymmetry wasn't there, but that it didn't have enough time to present itself.  Over the past decade technology has drastically reduced the time it takes to turn an idea into reality - i.e. the time it takes to make a move.

As leverage increases, we stop playing simpler games. Before we had computers, a large amount of time and effort was involved in keep track of numbers and basic numerical calculations. As we had better technology, we were able to shift more of our time to playing more complex games: figuring out what to create and how to create it.

And lastly, games that were always complex become even more complex due to leverage. Our ideas are subconsciously limited by the leverage we have available to us because our minds don't like to dream about things that it believes are impossible. Most filmmakers a century ago likely wouldn't have dreamt of making a film about intergalactic politics, and constrained their ideas to films that could take place in the normal world. As leverage increased, filmmakers were able to dream bigger and wider. Their minds opened up to more possibilities within the same game, making the game more complex.

...

I made a claim earlier that the games we play are far more complex than Chess and Go. A good reader would have been annoyed that I offered no explanation. Even though my intuition led me to write that claim quickly, the explanation wasn't as straightforward as I initially felt it would be.

There is a hierarchy of complexity for human endeavors. The most complex human activities are the ones in which success is measured by how good we make people feel.

And the representational complexity of feeling is far greater than that of Chess or Go. By representational complexity I mean how easy it is to describe the state of the game at any moment in time. A game that has a much more complicated state, likely has many more possibilities for what moves you can take, and is therefore more complex in general.

To see why, recall when you had to communicate how you felt. You'll remember how difficult it is to do so, and importantly that no matter how many words you use, you weren't able to fully, completely, represent your feeling in words. This is because a feeling has a much higher representational complexity than words. Trying to represent a feeling in words is difficult because we are trying to represent something of a higher complexity into a medium that has less complexity. Information is bound to be lost.

It's precisely this lost information that allows for the various interpretations of words. Every single person reading this essay will have different feelings as they read this. Even though my intention is to make you feel what I feel about this topic, there is absolutely no way for me to do so without any loss of information, no matter what medium I use: words, images, videos, symbols, anything - even if I spend my entire life trying. This gap is quite large.

The representational complexity of Chess and Go can easily be represented by symbols, and therefore I believe that any game in which success is measured by how good you make someone feel will be orders of magnitude more complex than Chess and Go (proportional to the difference in complexity between feeling and a sequence of symbols). Therefore, the underlying asymmetry that we are moving towards is quite extreme.

As leverage increases, we move up the complexity hierarchy to play games measured by how good you make people feel. A couple of centuries ago, most workers spent their time playing games that had nothing to do with how to make someone feel. They'd often assemble physical things in a factory. As that region progressed, they built better technology to require less workers to manufacture the same thing, and also offshored simpler work to other places, leaving workers to move up complexity towards services such as marketing, support, design, etc, which are closer to solving for how to make people feel good.

We notice this trend today as well. Programmers are being asked to become better at thinking about what to build and understanding users, without just thinking about how to build something (https://x.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1637087219591659520). Animators are being asked to contribute something meaningful to the story instead of only translating a rough sketch into a completed animation. Pizza cooks, and ice cream store employees, are being asked to tell engaging stories on social media to attract more customers. Everyone is moving towards figuring out how to make people feel.

Artists for thousands of years have been solving for how to make people feel. Which is why it's no surprise that the arts have always had extreme asymmetry. Human progress is pushing us all towards the games that artists have been playing for a long time, and also the extreme asymmetry that artists have felt for a long time.

...

We can't be satisfied with any conclusions about asymmetry without thinking about the role of fairness. The real world is not like a board game. It's not fair.

Let's imagine a fairy tale world. Every child would have loving, caring, supportive parents, wonderful teachers, the freedom to explore what they want. No one is concerned about how to make a living. Everyone has access to great healthcare, etc. 

In this imaginary world, we all have incredibly high leverage: anything we imagine can be manifested into reality quickly. Have an idea for an app? It will be built in a day according to your instructions and you can share it with the entire world. The same for a video, song, etc. Whatever you can imagine and express well enough through some mediums (language, drawing, etc.) someone or something will turn it into reality for you. In this world all you will care about is to create things that you and others want - whether that's art, better medical instruments, physical things, whatever you want.

What do you think the outcomes of this imaginary world would look like?

I believe it would be incredibly asymmetric. That the richest person in this world will be so stupidly rich that it's unfathomable to us right now. And that there would be a massive variance in outcomes across the board.

I believe this to be true because in a highly leveraged world, we have more possibilities and we make moves much quicker. Therefore, slight differences in choices at the start of the game would lead to drastic differences by the time we die, simply due to the complexity of the game.

And what we've noticed in our world is that not all explorations are equally worthwhile. Someone who spends their entire life learning how to craft the best baskets to sell to their village will not have the same outcomes as someone who developed an interest for building, say, software.

A slightly different influence that leads to a difference choice early will have incredibly large difference in where you end up. The greater the leverage, the greater the difference because the deeper in the game decision tree you can get to before you die.

Two twin children, that open up a social app and see two different videos are in influenced in subtly different ways. Since each decision they make from then on is faster to make due to leverage, even subtle difference in influence will lead to drastic differences by the time they die.

And this isn't even taking into account the difference in our abilities at birth! If we include that, then asymmetry will be even greater. I think it's silly to think that we're not born with different capabilities, different strengths and weaknesses, different emotional reactions to the same stimuli. Nature is a complex system - maybe even more complex than our feelings. Expecting it to produce two equal things of anything is a delusion.

Now, unfairness can also cause inequality. But the shape of the inequality caused by unfairness is fundamentally different than the shape of the inequality caused by fairness + leverage. We'll need to train ourselves to be able to differentiate between them, but the idea that a fair world would be equal is a delusion.

...

Human progress makes the world more fair.

Someone born poor 2000 years ago had very little chance to move up in life. They'd likely be an indentured laborer or worse a slave. They'd have little to no freedom. They'd be unable to speak their mind against someone richer than them. There were rigid class divisions in society. 

Even a century ago, most factory workers would likely never be able to afford starting their own factory one day because their wages would never add up to be enough, and because they wouldn't have access to capital (far fewer investors). Generally only those that had wealth had the ability to create what they wanted.

Today, even in many of the poorest communities around the world, many kids have the ability to create, to speak their minds in ways their grandparents couldn't dream of, and have access to information and knowledge through the internet that is barely any less than the richest kid living in a high rise building in Manhattan.

Human progress reduces the barrier to entry and spreads it wider.

Yet, it's undeniable that the child that has access to higher quality feedback, more competent, ambitious peers, a stronger safety net, and more supportive loving parents, has an unfair advantage. While have a great deal of work to do, and we shouldn't stop pushing for a more fair world. But the world is more fair than it has ever been in modern history.

Every humanitarian effort. Every improvement in technology. Every advancement in medicine, government policy, etc. will all help us get closer to a fair world, that will simultaneously be more asymmetric, unequal.

...

Asymmetry is a function of complexity. The greater the complexity of a game, the greater the asymmetry within the game and for the outcomes of the game.

The complexity of the games we play is a function of leverage. The greater leverage that exists in the world, the more complex the games we play become.

Leverage is a function of human progress. Every positive advancement pushes us towards a more fair and leveraged world.

Therefore, asymmetry is rising.

...

But, asymmetry isn't rising linearly. Leverage is accelerating exponentially, and therefore so is asymmetry.

Global GDP is a rough, but directionally correct, approximation of the leverage in the world. The more leverage that exists in the world means that we are able to turn more ideas into reality, creating and selling more things of higher value.

It's only a rough approximation because it only represents the transactions between us that involve a monetary exchange. There are many transactions that increase due to leverage that aren't directly captured by an exchange of money such as liking social media posts.

GDP is also a lagging indicator of leverage because it takes time to turn leverage into transactions because even though the time it takes to turn an idea to reality decreases, it's still not 0. And only executed ideas have an opportunity to impact GDP.

We can see how leverage is accelerating exponentially by observing how our global GDP is rising exponentially: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-gdp-over-the-long-run.

Therefore asymmetry is not just increasing, but increasing exponentially fast.

...

Intellectual understanding of asymmetry is not enough to act optimally in an extremely asymmetric world because we lack the appropriate intuitive, emotional response to guide us.

Instead of fearing equality as we should, we crave it. [^1]

And our craving blinds us to reality. The more our beliefs deviate from reality, the more we suffer, as we'll see in the following examples.

...

When a team leader sees that a group of teammates are performing equally well, they celebrate it, whereas they should be fearing it. In a world with extreme asymmetry, equally performing teammates implies the following:
1. *The team is not well leveraged*. They are using outdated technology that is slower to turn their ideas into reality, or they don't know how to apply leverage effectively.
2. *The team consists of average players*. As we saw in our board games, the greater the asymmetry, the greater the difference between the top player and the next best. The difference between players only goes down the more you move towards the worst players. A team of terrible players would all be equally bad. A team of great players would have great differences in ability between them.
3. *The team's activities are not complex as they could be*. This is likely due to them not adapting themselves to an increase in leverage by moving up the complexity hierarchy to doing more complex work. For example: someone continuing to manually summarizing and transcribing notes, or coding simple functions when present technology can do it way more efficiently.
4. *The team leader is terrible at assessing productivity*. As leverage increases, productivity becomes more difficult to measure because the activities become more complex, but also because our craving for equality blinds us to just how differently able individuals are.
5. *The team is not moving fast enough*. Asymmetry manifests more slowly the slower a team executes (i.e. the slower they make their moves).

And it should be noted that there is also asymmetry for how much each factor contributes to the problem - it's not that each of the points above are equally responsible at any given point in time. If I were to pick the most important factor it would be that the team does not consist of great players, because if they were good, they'd be obsessed about increasing their leverage as much as possible, moving as fast as possible, assessing productivity more accurately, and would be paranoid about not letting in average players [^2], 

You might say for the sake of the employees and society, teams shouldn't be obsessed about improving themselves by identifying their internal asymmetries (implying they shouldn't fire low performers). But the fact is that teams that don't organize themselves around asymmetry will find it incredibly difficult to compete. What that ideal organization looks like is a nuanced topic that I'll cover later - but one thing is certain: it looks quite different from how we've been building companies so far. And since asymmetry is growing rapidly, companies that aren't aligned with reality will become irrelevant more quickly than ever before.

You may also believe that it's probably good to slow down this rate of change to make it easier on employees. Whether you realize it or not, by saying this you're also advocating for slower human progress meaning a slower rate of increase in fairness in the world. Everything is connected.

Since asymmetry is indirectly a function of leverage, every time we see a bump in leverage (e.g. a more powerful AI model is released), we will notice massive layoffs, as well as a sharp rise in compensation and demand for top talent. Many are already feeling this paradox: the job market seems terrible, yet companies are desperate for great talent and are willing to pay more than ever. Asymmetry is manifesting itself.

...

Similarly, a young person who wants to join a great company so that they can become great at their craft should fear companies in which there is great equality between employees. I often hear people coming back from interviews claiming "wow, everyone there seems great at what they do!", and end up joining the company. This was a great heuristic when we had less leverage (meaning the world was less asymmetric and there wasn't as great of a difference between great players), but is incredibly dangerous today.

A prospective employee with the right intuition would be paranoid about understanding whether the company is truly equal internally, or they're just saying they are. Of course, all companies (even the great ones) will claim they are equal internally because it's not culturally acceptable yet to claim that they aren't, but not uncovering the true inequality internally will lead a prospective employee to make incredibly suboptimal decisions.

To be clear, there are many "highly valued" companies on the market that are incredibly equal internally, and therefore are rotting. A company's value is a lagging indicator of their health. Today's rot will manifest in earnings down the line. And so any job hunter that has the right intuition for asymmetry and how the world works should fear being lured in by a company's present value.

...

Similarly a prospective student that wants to join the best learning program, who has the right intuition for asymmetry and how it's changing, should be fearful of any academic program that claims that a high percentage of its graduates are equally competent or have found jobs that pay similarly well. That's a sign that the graduates are average, and / or that they are joining companies that are average. And if you join such a learning program you too will join a company that will become irrelevant soon.

Selectivity is not what matters, it's the outcomes. A highly selective organization that still has equal outcomes is almost certainly a terrible one. A useless organization can still have asymmetric outcomes that make it seem that it's a great institution. They do this by simply bringing together a bunch of ambitious talent together and letting them do their thing. It's important to understand how much the institution is actually impacting the asymmetric outcomes. [^3]

And lastly it's important to also be cautious of asymmetry when the best player is average. That means that not only is the institution not teaching the skills at the level of complexity required to be relevant, it means they suck at teaching even simpler skills. There are ways to gauge how good the talent is that I'll cover in detail in subsequent essays.

1. *This craving for equality was useful in a world with far less leverage than what we have today. In a world with less leverage and more rigid class divides, it was important for us to fight for equality of opportunity, for fairness. And yet our obsession morphed from fairness to equality everywhere. Our collective culture was shaped by this obsession for equality. We see it everywhere: teachers are praised when all students perform equally well, nations founded on the principle that "all men are created equal", etc. As the world becomes more asymmetric, our delusions become greater and more disconnected from reality. Our culture shapes our intuitions and emotional responses to situations. There are some emotional responses that evolution conditions us with: most of us have an aversion jumping from high places, or running into fire. Others are conditioned by culture. Our fear of of inequality and craving for equality are conditioned by our outdated culture.*
2. *As fast as **possible**. The "possible" is very important. As I'll explore in another essay, the best teams might actually seem to be moving a bit slower than the next best because how much time to spend on thinking vs. acting is also a function of leverage. I believe the more leverage you have, the more time you ought to spend thinking before acting. It's more important to find the right path to take, rather than just moving fast along any path. And finding the better paths takes more thinking time.*
3. *I suspect the only role that most colleges play today is to put a bunch of sharp, ambitious people together. If those individuals were similarly grouped together outside of a college environment, I'm confident we'd still see incredible results, and possibly even much greater results.*

...

This essay only scratches the surface of how the world is becoming more asymmetric and how our intuitions are outdated. The slower we are to update our intuitions and habits to be aligned with the rapidly changing reality of the world, the more difficult we will find it becomes to get what we want.

In this upcoming decade, with the sharp rise in leverage we will witness through artificial intelligence, we will see an unfathomable increase in asymmetry. Everywhere we look will be extremely asymmetric, unequal.

Equality should be feared. Except one kind: the equality of opportunity. Let's make the world more fair, and adapt to the rising inequality it will result in.

The need for compassion, towards others and ourselves, is greater than ever before.

Our minds have been programmed by evolution to respect those that achieve greater results, and respect less those who achieve less. This was a useful programming back when we were hunter gatherers because in that context when an individual achieved less it meant less food for the tribe and everyone would suffer. Our craving for external validation, craving for status, and even our jealousy, helped us work hard to contribute equally well to the tribe, so that we weren't left behind.

Unfortunately in the modern world this evolutionary programming only leads to suffering. Asymmetry is inevitable, and it will always be the case that someone or the other achieves much, much more than you. Your neighbor, your childhood friends, a kid that wasn't even born when you started trying to be good at what you do will achieve more than you for reasons that won't be easy to decipher.

Perhaps this explains the paradox we see today in the developed world: we somehow have more things, more opportunities, and yet we somehow seem... less happy.

Therefore, the accelerating asymmetry in our lives even calls for an entirely different intuition for the game that is at the root of all the games we play: the pursuit of happiness. Updating our habits to be more aligned with reality is necessary not just for material wellbeing, but also happiness.

[[I'd appreciate your feedback]] on this essay.

[^1] *Note: You may say that modeling our endeavors as games is reductive. I agree that it is, but I believe it's still directionally correct - that the lessons we extrapolate from smaller games apply to the more complex games each of us plays to get what we want. In future essays I plan to dive deeper into the nuances of the games we play, and specifically into the nature of our minds - which is what dictates why we want what we want and how we go about getting it.*

[^2] *note: there are many ways to measure game complexity, and it's an active space of research. I've tried to provide a simpler definition to work with for now which I believe to be accurate enough for the sake of our discussion, and that any better measure of complexity shouldn't change the conclusions we derive from this.*

[^3] *This happens due to the underlying incentives that govern a group of individuals - which is an interesting topic that I plan to dive deep into in another essay. Those incentives don't change unless the fundamental nature of the individual mind changes, and I don't see that happening anytime soon.*

[^4] *And asymmetry is accelerating exponentially because leverage increases exponentially. We can see why by looking at global gdp curve. Global GDP is a lagging indicator of leverage. It's lagging to the degree of time it takes to use the latest technology to turn an idea to reality. For example, the true economic value of what current AI technologies will bring to the world will only become apparent in a couple of years after people have actually used that technology to create value in the world. So the true leverage available in this moment will only be reflected by global gdp after some time. Yet, despite this lag, global gdp still gives us a good sense of the trajectory. Just remember to apply exponential increase when extrapolating.*

[^5] *To be clear, when I say  most of us don't have the intuition to do this, I'm not implying that everyone is in a position to get what they want even if they gain intuition quickly. That's because there is still a of work we need to do to ensure equality of opportunity. Someone in a war torn region in the world, no matter how much intuition they have, may still struggle to turn that intuition into outcomes due to circumstance. But if you're reading this it probably means that you have access to the internet, have at least a smartphone, and at least an hour of time a day to do what you want. I believe that's the minimum required to train intuition and afford what you want within a decade.*

[^6] *Contrary to popular belief that greats fear less than the rest of us, I believe all greats of their crafts actually have greater fear towards lack of growth. The better you get, the more you can see how most paths will not lead to the sort of growth you want, and the more healthy fear you develop. It's no surprise that books such as "Only the paranoid survive" were written. (Disclaimer: I haven't read the book, the title just seemed relevant.)*

(?) *Intuition is far more difficult to train than intellectual understanding. This has drastic implications on our education system, which I'll dive into in a future essay. Specifically, I believe that pay-to-learn education is outdated because it doesn't have the right incentives for an extremely asymmetric world.*
