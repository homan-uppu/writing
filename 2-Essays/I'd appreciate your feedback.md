I'm deluded.

I believe that the degree of your delusion corresponds to the degree of your suffering because the less your beliefs are aligned with reality, the more likely your actions will fail to give you the results you want - in any aspect of life.

I write in order to identify and correct my own delusions, so that I can get what I want. I've noticed that no matter how deeply I think about something, feedback from others helps me identify my own delusions in ways that I can't do on my own.

No matter how deeply I think things through, it's impossible for me to question every deeply held belief I have about how the world works. It could be the case that a subconscious delusion leads me down the wrong path such that no matter how great my thinking is, since the thinking was grounded in delusion, the conclusions I draw are bound to be deluded. Subconscious delusion manifests as confirmation bias - no matter how much research I do, I may not be able to sniff out my delusion.

You're incredibly deluded as well, but we're both certainly deluded in different ways. This is the beauty of nature: nothing is equal. You will be able to sniff out some of my delusions in ways that I can't because you might not share that delusion, or may not share it to the same degree. Our differences will help us push each other to be less deluded.

This is why I'd greatly appreciate your feedback on my essays. Your feedback is essential to help me seek truth effectively. I can't do it without your help.

Another reason I publish my writing is so that you can share with me things I don't know, which could impact my thinking. This is incredibly useful as well, but my benefit here is time saved, whereas my benefit if you identify a delusion is to unblock me in ways I may have never been able.

For writing motivated in this way, I believe there is a great way to give feedback, and I ask that you try to give me great feedback. These are the guidelines that I follow:

Negative feedback is far more valuable than positive feedback. Telling me something doesn't work or invalidating something I said is much more helpful than saying something is. Avoid positive feedback. [^1]

Attacking the foundation of the essay (the core point that everything is constructed upon) is more valuable than attacking a branch that even if it fell off it wouldn't impact anything.

Providing evidence is more valuable than providing a feeling. 

Evidence could be a reference, explanation, or even sharing an experience that is misaligned with what I claimed. All are valid. And I've often found that personal experiences to be even more valuable than referencing external sources because when we're thinking about something that is at the cutting edge, there are likely to be fewer external references.

The problem with feeling is that it's incredibly difficult to distinguish between a feeling that stems from your own delusion vs. a feeling that stems from intuition that is aligned with reality. It's often the case that when you read something that is true but misaligned with your beliefs, you'll have a negative reaction to it: anger, fear, discomfort, something. [^2] 

Therefore when you tell me something feels off, I can't take it into account. Naturally if my writing is good, it make you feel that something is off because it challenges something you believe deeply. In fact, if you say nothing feels off that's a bigger red flag for me than if you say something feels off. In fact, I probably wouldn't publish an essay if multiple people say that it makes perfect sense.

That being said, I fully acknowledge that when something feels off to you, it could be because you're right and you've identified one of my delusions. I just ask that you try your best to express why something feels off. Try to translate your feeling into an explanation because that is something I can work with.

Attack the foundation. Provide evidence or an explanation. Elevate your feelings into explanations.

At the very end of your feedback, I'd appreciate hearing from you the difference in how you felt before and after you read the essay, and what questions the essay has spawned in your mind. You will certainly have questions / ideas that pop up in your mind that I haven't had because we are different. I want to steal the good ones.

[^1] *I also view writing as a form of finding and eliminating what doesn't work without worrying about what works.*

[^2] *I believe we have negative reactions towards truths misaligned with our beliefs because we addicted to our beliefs. We react negatively according to the degree of addiction. This is why the world often reacts with great hate towards any truths that go against their deeply held beliefs. It's the same reaction you'd see from an addict that is held down by someone from chasing after what they're addicted to.*
