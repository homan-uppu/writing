I'm deluded.

I believe that the degree of my delusion corresponds to the degree of my suffering because the less my beliefs are aligned with reality, the more likely my actions will fail to give me the results I want - in any aspect of my life.

I write in order to identify and correct my own delusions, so that I can get what I want. I've noticed that no matter how deeply I think about something, feedback from others helps me identify my own delusions in ways that I can't do on my own. Your help is invaluable.

No matter how deeply I think things through, it's impossible for me to question every deeply held belief I have about how the world works. It could be the case that a subconscious delusion leads me down the wrong path such that no matter how great my thinking is, since the thinking was grounded in delusion, the conclusions I arrive at are bound to be deluded.[^1]

You're incredibly deluded as well, but we're both certainly deluded in different ways. This is the beauty of nature: nothing is equal. You will be able to sniff out some of my delusions in ways that I can't because you might not share that exact delusion, or may not share it to the same degree. Our differences will help us push each other to be less deluded.

This is why I'd greatly appreciate your feedback on my essays. Your feedback is essential to help me seek truth effectively. I can't do it without your help.

For writing motivated in this way, I believe there is a great way to give feedback, and I ask that you try to give me great feedback. These are the guidelines that I follow:

Negative feedback is far more valuable than positive feedback. Telling me something doesn't work or invalidating something I said is much more helpful than saying something is. Avoid positive feedback. [^2]

Attacking the foundation of the essay (the core point that everything is constructed upon) is more valuable than attacking a branch that even if it fell off it wouldn't impact anything.

Providing evidence is more valuable than providing a feeling. 

Evidence could be a reference, explanation, or even sharing an experience that is misaligned with what I claimed. All are valid. And I've often found that personal experiences to be even more valuable than referencing external sources because when we're thinking about something that is at the cutting edge, there are likely to be fewer external references.

The problem with feeling is that it's incredibly difficult to distinguish between a feeling that stems from your own delusion vs. a feeling that stems from intuition that is aligned with reality. It's often the case that when you read something that is true but misaligned with your beliefs, you'll have a negative reaction to it: anger, fear, discomfort, something. [^3] 

Therefore when you tell me something feels off, I can't take it into account. Naturally if my writing is good, it make you feel that something is off because it challenges something you believe deeply. In fact, if you say nothing feels off that's a bigger red flag for me than if you say something feels off. In fact, I probably wouldn't publish an essay if multiple people say that it makes perfect sense.

That being said, I fully acknowledge that when something feels off to you, it could be because you're right and you've identified one of my delusions. I just ask that you try your best to express why something feels off. Try to translate your feeling into an explanation because that is something I can work with.

Attack the foundation. Provide evidence or an explanation. Elevate your feelings into explanations.

At the very end of your feedback, I'd appreciate hearing from you the difference in how you felt before and after you read the essay, and what questions the essay has spawned in your mind. You will certainly have questions / ideas that pop up in your mind that I haven't had because we are different. I want to steal the good ones.

Giving great feedback is a lot of effort. Reading an essay thoroughly, thinking deeply and writing feedback could take an hour or many. Why should you go through this effort to help me seek truth?

I think there are many benefits to challenging yourself to think more critically, but I think one outshines them all. By giving me great feedback I will hold you in high regard. I will want to collaborate with you. I will want to invite you to everything I do. I will want to share with you ideas much sooner without fleshing them out as much. I believe great thinking is severely lacking in our world, and by demonstrating your ability to think, I will have no choice but to try and collaborate with you in some sense - whether that's helping you craft your own ideas, implement them, whatever it may be.

Now, if I were you, I'd stop and ask the question: "Is this person even going to do something meaningful?". Because if you believe that I'm not going to achieve much in the world, you probably shouldn't prioritize giving me feedback on my writing because the returns on your investment would be quite low: the most you'd get is probably my feedback on your writing.

But if you believe that there's a chance that I may do something big someday that could change the world in a meaningful way, then the expected return on investment would be much, much higher because by taking the time to give me great feedback, you greatly increase the likelihood of me wanting to collaborate with you.

I have some big ideas in my mind that I do believe will meaningfully impact the world. Give me great feedback to increase the chances of us working on them together. And of course, by work on them with me I mean that you too will shape and own those ideas because as I said: I'm deluded.

Lastly, if you don't think you can carve out the time to give me great feedback, just wait until you have the time. By sending me half baked feedback I will form a negative impression about your ability to think well. And consistent poor feedback means I will not ask you for your feedback again. Nothing stagnates, it only accelerates upwards or downwards. This principle applies to collaboration as well.

[^2] *I also view writing as a form of finding and eliminating what doesn't work without worrying about what works.*

[^3] *I believe we have negative reactions towards truths misaligned with our beliefs because we addicted to our beliefs. We react negatively according to the degree of addiction. This is why the world often reacts with great hate towards any truths that go against their deeply held beliefs. It's the same reaction you'd see from an addict that is held down by someone from chasing after what they're addicted to.*
