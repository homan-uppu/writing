Artificial intelligence is rapidly pushing us to be more creative by doing the grunt work for us. As all of our work becomes more creative, outcomes will be skewed: most results will increasingly be captured by a small set of top performers. In such a world, the traditional business model of education: paying money up front in exchange for an education and degree, no longer works because most graduates won't be good enough as they won't be one of the best at what they do (by definition). The only business model that works in a highly creative world is venture capital: giving promising individuals capital in exchange for equity in their future outcomes.
## AI makes our work more creative.

First, let me define what I mean by creativity: the more creative a task is, the more ways there are to do it. From a game theory standpoint, creativity is proportional to game complexity. In games with greater game complexity (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_complexity) you can take more actions, and end up in more possible states. A worker on a factory line only has so many ways in which they can assemble something. It's not that creative. A content creator has nearly endless possibilities for the video they make. Highly creative.

AI makes our work more creative by doing the less creative work for us (which is easier to solve). Technology has already been doing this for a long time. AI is accelerating it.

We've already seen significant impact of AI in software engineering. As AI handles much of the implementation details, engineers spend more time on more creative decisions: system design, architecture, and product decisions.

(following 2 paras should probably be incorporated in the next section).
The more creative our work becomes, the greater the difference in outcomes between two individuals. A group of professional software engineers tasked with implementing a small function would likely all converge at a few different, albeit mostly similar from a practical standpoint, ways of doing it. The best approach probably wouldn't be significantly better than the average one.

But, if you give the same group of engineers a description of an app to create, we'll find that great differences in what they create, because there are just way more ways to do it. And the best approach will likely be significantly better than the average - likely by orders of magnitude.

## Creative work follows the power law

In any creative field like business, music, films, books, Youtube, TikTok, X, OnlyFans etc., a small percentage of creators capture most of the value created.

(ref: Andrew Chen's image of the creator economy).

There is no creator middle class. Or if there will be, we haven't seen it yet in creative fields.

The middle class only exists in not-so-creative work, which has often been in doing the less creative work in creative industries. Company founders were either rich or went broke, but factory workers were part of the middle class: making similar wages as a large number of other factory workers, doing work not so different from each other. Filmmakers either became crazy successful or flopped and left the industry broke, while those doing less creative work to manage and operate a set were part of the middle class: they were required on any film set, and had more job security than a director.

As AI gets better, it will push us to be more creative. While this will lead to a creative explosion in every domain impacted by AI leading to incredible discoveries faster than ever before, it will also push our entire economy towards looking like the creator economy, meaning we'll see the power law distribution of outcomes more extreme and more widely found than ever before.

## Traditional education system doesn't work in creative world.

As our work becomes more creative, most graduates will struggle to recoup their investment in their education - *regardless of the quality of their education.*

That last phrase "regardless of the quality of their education" is really important and probably one of the most counterintuitive points of this essay. The point is, the more creative the work is, the less guarantees there are in being able to train someone to be good enough to create value in the field, even if they have the best education possible.

There are countless stories of creatives whose children who chose to follow in their parent's footsteps that end up failing to create any value, even though they had the best resources and mentorship possible.

Even if Mr. Beast started a college to train Youtube Creators, the majority of graduates will still struggle to make ends meet relying entirely on the income generated through making content. And even for the ones that make it, it's not clear, or predictable, how long it would take them. Some creators may take off right away, while others may have to endure a slow grind for years before seeing significant revenue, and most may give up before they get there.

Ycombinator is the world's most successful startup accelerator that funds and mentors startup founders. If they had a reliable way of training successful founders, they would have done so! Yet, the majority of startups fail.

When the outcomes are so unpredictable, it's no longer possible to pay $X for an education because most people who do so won't be in a position to pay it back - especially if it's expensive.

**All knowledge work is rapidly becoming more creative, therefore paying money up front to learn anything is no longer viable.** 

There are a few early signs that hint at this truth.

I used to wonder why coding bootcamps have such a hard time. Why are they such difficult businesses to build? At the surface level it seems reasonably straightforward and do-able: if you can train someone to be a great software engineer, they'll go make a six-figure salary, and therefore you can charge into the tens of thousands for such a course. And you should be able to train them to be good enough. Right?

I think this actually worked in the early days (mid 2010's). There were quite a few success stories coming out of bootcamps, including a few friends of mine.

But then things started to get really, really difficult for them. I believe the reason is that software engineering had started to become more and more creative as technology improved. It was no longer enough to be competent at solving smaller programming problems (which bootcamps trained you well at doing), you actually had to know how to build and ship great software - a much more creative task, that takes much longer to train, is therefore much more expensive to train. And because it's more creative, you'll have a more power law -ish distribution of outcomes - and so there will be more graduates who won't be employed.

Note: even ISAs are unsustainable because they are still paying to learn - just that someone else is paying and taking the risk of a student learning. The bootcamp won't survive.

If my understanding is correct, it will soon be impossible to find a sustainable bootcamp for software engineering because the creativity in the field is about to explode. After all, you can't sustainably, reliably teach taste, intuition, judgement, independent thinking and a natural curiosity for the craft - all of which will become table stakes, not just "nice to have" qualities in software engineers as the field becomes more creative.

Colleges have the same business model as bootcamps: money up front in exchange for an education and degree. Colleges (as they exist today) won't be relevant as all of our work becomes more creative because they operate on a fundamentally invalid business model.

We're seeing signs of this today: there are countless new grads failing to get jobs, or even interviews, while simultaneously there exists an incredible demand for great talent at Tech companies with never before seen, sky high, compensations. Both can be true because the field is becoming more creative, concentrating the demand towards the best. Average won't cut it anymore. People wonder how companies announce massive layoffs while still hiring exceptional talent... they're simply adapting to the growing leverage, and the increase in skill required.

(note: *I want to be clear: the world can be slow to change. Going to a top college program will still likely be great for your career even today because*... something something - fill this out later.)

*(note: somewhere should state why I'm taking software engineering as my primary example - because computer science is the most popular major, and because I believe it generalizes for any kind of knowledge work.)*

## Why can't everyone be good enough?

In the ideal world, everyone has found a niche that they're uniquely, instinctively great at, and have the capacity to make something people want and are willing to pay for.

Perhaps with world-class personalized training for each child, a healthy & safe (physically and emotionally) upbringing, and sufficient safety net for each person we may be able to get close to this. Or rather, we should try to get to a world in which everyone can contribute something meaningful to others and create value.

But the world is a messy, unpredictable place, and it will take us a long time before we get anywhere close to this ideal - if we ever do. I'm hesitant to think much further about this because it goes into a much more philosophical debate about nature vs. nurture, and how similar our potentials are in this world. My intuition is that there is a great deal of inequality even at birth because nature itself is unequal: it's never made two things that are the same. And therefore, we will never reach this ideal, utopia world in which everyone can contribute well, even if they're all given the same access to resources, tools, etc.

Even if we have a power law distribution of ability in new grads, why won't most of them get hired?

When the power law was less pronounced (work was less creative, i.e. we had less leverage), the best weren't likely orders of magnitude better than the average, and therefore it was possible to reliably hire even average grads and train them to be good enough to positively contribute to the company. As we saw at the start of the essay when people work on less creative work, less complex work, their differences aren't as pronounced (assuming each has had similar training).

But, as the complexity of the task increases, hiring even thousands of average folks can't match a single great talent.

Imagine this: every engineer has access to a near infinite number of reasonably intelligent (junior level intelligence) agents that can work 24/7, follow instructions quite well, and have access to the most code previously written by humans. Where's the room for the average here? A tiny difference in ability leads to an astronomical difference in outcomes.

Companies that hire the average engineer simply won't be able to compete with the ones that have the best talent.

"Especially in software, many situations have winner-take-all dynamics due to network effects and switching costs. Being the winner means being in the 99.99-percentile. A winner at the top takes nearly everything, and only a pittance goes to the others — so being 99.99-percentile is worth an order of magnitude or two more than being just 98-percentile." (Peter Thiel / Joe Lonsdale - https://www.8vc.com/resources/lessons-from-peter-thiel).

But, once again, you could get away with hiring average before AI when the difference between the best and the average wasn't that great. (prob need to expand on this).

Now, "best" is relative. And someone who's one of the best today could become average tomorrow. These things are difficult to assess reliably.

Yet, the world will take time to react. Many companies, who are basically walking corpses: i.e. they don't have the ability to compete because they're way too slow to adapt to new technology, and are organizationally structured in outdated ways, will still hire in the old ways because they have money in the bank. They'll still give great value to top credentials. So, I don't see a big problem anytime soon for those graduating from the top 5 colleges, but what about the rest? It's going to get really difficult.

Startups are often the fastest to react to reality and also show us a glimpse of how all companies in the future will act. Based on my observations, I can confidently say that it's near impossible to get into a competitive startup if you're average anymore. There's no more room for the average.

## Venture capital eats education

The only viable business model for a power law distribution of outcomes is investing money into individuals in exchange for equity in their outcomes. The few winners who win big will give enough returns to allow for the majority of others not winning big, or losing.

But, there's a big problem: we don't yet have the 

we don't yet have a financial instrument that allows us to do this (or maybe we do and it's just not popular). We invest in companies for equity in the company, but how can we invest in an individual and gain equity in everything that individual creates in the future?
