## Intro

As AI gets more powerful, most people won't make enough to be able to recoup their investment in their education.

This will happen because AI makes knowledge work (and eventually all work) more creative, by doing the less creative parts of it for us. The more creative our work becomes, the more its outcomes follow the power law distribution: the best capture the majority of the value created, and the median compensation becomes insufficient.

In a world in which knowledge work is highly creative, the only business model for education that works is venture capital: putting money in the hands of students (instead of asking them to pay), in exchange for equity in their outcomes (i.e. a small equity in the assets they will own in the future). The few that strike big, will provide sufficient returns to compensate for the increasing many that won't become good enough.

This essay is structured in 4 parts:
1. I start by establishing the relationship between creativity and the power law (and an insufficient median compensation), and why I believe they are impossible to disconnect from each other.
2. Then, I explain how all knowledge work will become highly creative and hence will adopt the insufficient median compensation, which invalidates paying to learn as a viable business model for education.
3. After establishing why I believe the above claims are true with a high degree of confidence, I explore why the education system is bound to collapse catastrophically.
4. I explore what the future of education will look like.

If you're already bought into the initial parts, you may want to skip straight to 4.

## The power law dominates creative fields.

We've already observed that the power law dominates all creative fields:

- (andrew chen's image).
- (mobile app downloads)
- (companies - Peter Thiel quote).
- (only fans outcomes chart).
- (substack outcomes)

We've yet to find any sort of "middle class" in creative fields. In fact, they all seem to be becoming more lopsided over time: the best capture more value and the median value falls, as the tools to create become better, distribution becomes cheaper, and as the number of creators increase.

To be clear, the power law itself isn't the problem. It's not what invalidates the business model of paying for education. It's only when the median compensation isn't enough does paying to learn become invalidated, because that's when most students won't be able to earn back their investment. Yet, the power law distribution seems to be inextricably linked to an insufficient median compensation.

When I first came across this observation I was taken aback because it made it seem that the world was zero-sum: someone creating more value meant that they took it from someone else. But I also knew that these creative fields were positive sum: their overall markets have been growing rapidly. The pie is undeniably getting bigger. (note: insert relevant statistic). So everyone should be making more right? And in fact, more creators make more money overall.

Then I realized that the definition of what is considered sufficient changes rapidly in our modern world. As the rich create a market for more expensive cutting edge products and experiences, some of those innovations become so good that we all view them as necessities instead of luxuries, giving the rich unfair advantages. And while the median compensation may still afford the things that previous generations considered luxuries, it will never feel enough, increasingly so as we innovate more rapidly. In addition to this, there is still some element "taking from others". When a new product is created that is significantly better than what people already use, when people switch to it, the existing products do lose revenue. This also applies to content as well: when I find a new content creator covering the same topic as someone I already follow but in a way I find better, I'm more likely to switch over completely because I don't have time to watch both.

There may be more reasons at play (which would be an interesting topic for an essay of its own), but regardless it's quite clear that as the skill becomes more creative, and the power law distribution of outcomes becomes more extreme, the median compensation falls.
## Why most won't make enough.

Is it inevitable that most won't make enough in creative skills?

This is a super important question to explore before we go further because if it were possible for us to create a new education program that can reliably train people to be good enough at a highly creative skill, such that the median compensation is sufficient to recoup their investment in education, then paying to learn is not fundamentally broken, and I can end the essay here.

My belief is that it's impossible to **not** have a power law distribution of outcomes for highly creative skills, and thereby an insufficient median compensation - unless the equal outcomes is forced onto the system by an external agent (like a government) - **regardless of the quality of education available**.

And even if the outcomes are equalized, the underlying distribution of productivity still follows the power law, proportional to how creative the skill is. This is a fundamental property of creativity that won't change unless something fundamentally changes in the way our minds work.

Before I dive deeper to explain why I believe this, I need to more clearly define what I mean by creativity. The more creative a task is, the more ways there are to do it. Even more precisely: creativity is proportional to the number of actions you can take, and the number of possible states you can end up in. A worker on a factory line only has so many ways in which they can assemble something. It's not that creative. A content creator has nearly endless possibilities for a video. Highly creative.

When I started exploring this topic, the first thing I tried to look for was any evidence in human history of an excellent teacher or institution for a highly creative skill that trained the majority of its students to be good enough in that skill (i.e. they could live off of that skill). I couldn't find one.

Even at the most successful startup accelerators, the majority of startups fail. Even for the most legendary early stage startup investors, the majority of their investments failed. The majority who graduate the best courses for creating content, by content creators who have made it, can't live off of creating content. Historically, even at the greatest acting, writing, filmmaking schools, the majority of graduates could not establish themselves as actors, writers, or filmmakers. There are many children of world class creators who choose to go down the same path as their parent, and have access to the best mentorship and resources, and yet never become good enough.

Now, you might stop me there and claim that those who didn't make it as, say, filmmakers still found work in the film industry as assistant filmmakers, or some other role. But those roles are lower creativity, and hence they changed the skill itself to one that had a less pronounced power law distribution of productivity in order to sustain themselves. Or perhaps someone who studied writing to become an author, failed and ended up becoming a public school teacher. They left a higher creativity skill to a lower one. I still count these as failing at the more creative skill that they set out to do in the first place.

There's something about highly creative skills that makes them impossible to train reliably at scale, even when you have the best teacher, mentors, and resources. I think it's because the more creative the skill, the more it relies on intuition that manifests through taste (https://paulgraham.com/goodtaste.html) and judgement (https://nav.al/judgment). The less creative it a skill is, the more it relies on following rules and guidelines. With sufficient time, the latter can be trained for reliably. Training intuition can't be done directly. You can't read all the books there are on entrepreneurship and be able to build a great company. Training intuition happens indirectly: by doing, through inspiration, through personalized feedback at the right time from the right people. And even when all of those boxes are ticked, some peoples' intuitions may take very long to get good enough, and many never get good enough, for reasons that are difficult to explain, and would take an entire essay to explore in reasonable depth.

There's also another interesting, albeit more technical, piece of evidence that shows that the power law is directly proportional to how creative the skill is, and how it is inevitable.

Let's compare two popular board games: Chess & Go. Go is more creative than Chess according to our definition of creativity because there are many more actions you can take in Go from any given position, and you can end up in many more possible states. If we compare the relative skill of the players in these two board games, we'll find that the power law is more pronounced in Go than in Chess.  In other words, the best player in Go is much better than the average Go player than the best Chess player is compared to the average Chess player. And it's a smooth curve. I.e. the gap between 1 & 2 is greater in Go than in Chess, and so is the gap between 2 & 3, and so on.

What's also important to notice that the median relative skill in Go is lower than in Chess. Correlating to the real world in which people are compensated according to their productivity, it would mean that the mean compensation falls as the skill becomes more creative.

(todo: a neat diagram that shows the ELO ratings between the 2).

I really like this example because the games have largely remained unchained for decades, and most of the top players have the best possible training and resources, so you can't say that the power law only exists because the best had better training.  Even with significantly better training by playing computers, and excellent coaching centers for the best players, we still find the power law distribution of outcomes. Even if we achieve AGI and give each player access to the greatest coach imaginable, we would still find a power law distribution proportional to the degree of creativity of the game.

The more creative a skill becomes, the more extreme the power law distribution of productivity, and a lower median productivity.

(todo: there's prob more to be said about the connection between productivity and outcomes).
## All work will become highly creative.

So far we've only studied the behavior of highly creative skills. We've always had highly creative skills in the world, but only a small percentage of the world participated in them. Most did low creativity work, which is what enabled the middle class to rise: since the power law is minimal for low creativity work.

But soon all knowledge work, and eventually all work, will become highly creative, and the power law distribution of productivity (and outcomes) will be become quite extreme. This will happen because each time our technology becomes more powerful, it increases the level of creativity of our work, and thereby amplifies the power law distribution of outcomes for the skill.

To explain why, let's take the example of software engineering. I think it's a good case because it's the fastest growing major, and because those who work with technology are usually the first to adopt new technologies into their workflows and lives. Seeing how AI has changed software engineering will give us a glimpse of the future for all knowledge work.

Before AI, the majority of actual software engineering work was only moderately creative. Before AI, anyone who's built software applications knows just how much grunt work there is to turn an idea into reality. The majority of code written was "glue code" (todo: get a good reference here): code used to connect together different software services to make it do what you want. As someone building apps for a while now, I can vividly remember my frustrated days when I felt I had a really cool product idea, but then would have to grind for weeks to actually bring it to life doing boring, mostly non-creative work.

Now, with the latest AI models (OpenAI's o1 / Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 3.5), AI can write the majority of the less creativity code that took most of our time in the pre-AI era. Now, the majority of an engineer's time is spent on more creative work: on the system architecture, deciding which external services to use and why, and on product decisions like figuring out what to build and why, and they only need to drop down into lower creativity work in the cases that AI fails. And working on higher level architecture and product decisions is far more creative than writing glue code because there are many, many more possibilities in how you can do it.
> (note: this is in most cases, and this doesn't yet apply to those working on deep tech problems for which current models aren't good enough to help with that much yet), 

What will happen when each engineer has access to models that are 10x more capable than the current ones? What happens when each engineer has access to a near infinite number of reasonably capable, always-on, fast, teammates they can instruct as if they were instructing junior teammates? What happens when you can give an AI a detailed spec of the software you want built, and some design inspirations to help guide its style and look and feel, and it does a great job at implementing it? An engineer's work becomes even more creative: they'll focus more on product and business decisions: figuring out what to build and why, and only jumping down into technical details only when the AI fails.

In other words, engineers, as AI becomes more capable, will operate like startup founders. And we know just how creative that is, and just how extreme the power law distribution of productivity is for that.

It's easy to see how a similar evolution will happen for all knowledge work. Designers who spend time tweaking layout properties in their design software will instead spend far more time on defining the brand, product, understanding users and crafting a compelling vision. Marketers instead of spending most of their time operating software, and doing the grunt work to implement marketing campaigns, will instead spend most of their time understanding and optimizing for the incredibly complex and changing human desire.

The power law distribution of productivity will become un-imaginably steep. The right engineers, marketers, designers, or any role that we will invent, will be many, many orders more productive than the average.
## Early signs of the rise in creativity.
- Early signs of evidence:
	- bootcamps, etc. The initial success and then failure is evidence of the shift.
	- job hunting / evaluation will look like any artistic profession: what you've done, not based on any standardized assessment. (e.g. Why TripleByte failed).
## Collapse of our education system

OK, so where are we? All knowledge work is going to become highly creative, and therefore the outcomes will follow the power law distribution, and the median compensation will be insufficient to be able to recoup their investment in education.

We will have a couple of things to explore that could still sustain the pay-to-learn business model of education:
1. A central authority squashing the power law such that the median compensation doesn't become insufficient.
2. The price of education falling drastically such that the median compensation becomes sufficient.

Only if these two approaches aren't viable that we can conclude that paying to learn (i.e. the core business model of the world's education system) will become invalid.

## Venture capital will eat education.
## Concluding thoughts
- These shifts have a much larger impact than education.
- As I've been contemplating this topic for a while, I see the power law becoming more extreme everywhere and in every single thing that we do, directly proportional to how powerful AI becomes. It affects every aspect of our lives: how companies will be built, how companies hire talent, which cities and countries will quickly outpace the rest in their growth, how we make decisions: for any complex situation the gap between the best decision and the average decision is also growing, fundamentally changing the best strategy to work and get the things we want out of life.
- Venture capital and the power law are best friends. Venture capital will eat the world.
