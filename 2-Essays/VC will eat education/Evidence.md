If it's true that AI rapidly makes our work more creative, amplifying the power law distribution of outcomes and a lower median compensation, we should be seeing signs of this shift right now in the world. And we are.

Once again, I'm going to focus on the Tech industry, and more specifically software engineering because as I mentioned earlier, this domain most quickly adopts new technologies and so any trends that will impact the larger economy down the line often start here.

But, before I get to the evidence I also want to point out that we can't deduce much from the fact that there are countless new grad software engineers that can't land interviews, let alone jobs, right now because that could be due to hiring freezes due to over-hiring a couple of years ago or other reasons. And just because a class of grads can't get hired with their education doesn't necessarily point to the rise in the power law distribution of outcomes because without any other information it would be reasonable to assume that all of them, with the right training, can become good enough in a couple of years.

The evidence needs to uncover the changes in the power law distribution of outcomes, and the lower median compensation for it to be valuable evidence.

The first evidence is the failure of software engineering bootcamps. Back in the mid 2010's coding bootcamps were all the rage. 

- Early signs of evidence:
	- bootcamps, etc. The initial success and then failure is evidence of the shift.
	- job hunting / evaluation will look like any artistic profession: what you've done, not based on any standardized assessment. (e.g. Why TripleByte failed).
