## Getting straight to the point.

As AI gets more powerful, the outcomes of knowledge workers will follow the power law: the best will capture most of the value, leaving little for the average. The median compensations will plummet. The upper end compensations will skyrocket.

This shift will invalidate the core business model for education: paying for it, because most people will be unable to recoup the investment in their education because they won't be good enough.

It doesn't matter it's the student paying for it, or the government or the educational institute (via income sharing agreements, or the like), because all of them depend on a sufficient number of graduates being good enough to recoup the money invested in their education. Most of the students who take out loans will be debt ridden. The governments that offer free education for students will incur a great deal of public debt without the returns, and the institutions that delay charging payments from students hoping to take a cut of their future compensations (capped) will go broke because most won't have meaningful future compensations.

The only business model that works is to invest money into students, instead of asking it from them, in exchange for equity in their outcomes. For investors, those that become one of the best will more than compensate for the majority that won't.

## Attacking popular approaches to fixing education.

Many people seem to think that the way to improve our education system is to pump more money into it, and to subsidize education so that everyone can afford a high quality education while not being burdened by debt. 

What they don't realize is that the underlying business model of education, paying to learn, itself is under attack by the rise of AI. Shifting who's paying from the students to the government, or someone else, doesn't change the business model because it still relies on the majority of graduates to become good enough to be employed and earn back the investment in their education. The debt burden is just shifted from the individual to the collective.

AI makes our work more creative. The more creative our work becomes, the less reliably we can train to be good enough at it.

Paying for education will no longer work. The education system that will rise will be one that relies on venture capital to fund learning.
