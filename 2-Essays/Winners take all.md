title: Winners take all
date: May 2024
---

The world is becoming more "hit driven".
- 1% content creators capture most revenue.
- 1% of startups create most value.
- 1% hold most of the world's wealth.

We can't reverse or slow down this shift without slowing down our progress as a species. And we wouldn't want to do that.

The gap between the best and the next best will rise sharply. The gap between the 2nd best and the 3rd best will rise as well, but less than the best and 2nd. You will only see more equality in ability and outcomes as you tend towards the mediocre.

Winners will take all, everywhere, in anything.
- The top creators will capture most value.
- The top doctors will treat everyone.
- The top Pizza chefs will make pizzas for the entire world.
- The top city for startups will become the only one. 
- The top country will dictate global order and culture.

The only difference is in how long each takes.

- Be the best at what you do.
- Or find something else you can be the best at and double down.
- Or create something new that the world will value and be the best at it. 
- But, be the best.

We will be shocked by how rapidly this inequality accelerates; this is just the tip of the iceberg.

...

Inequality is a function of complexity. The greater the complexity, the greater the inequality.

In games, complexity corresponds to the number of possibilities within the game. A simpler game has fewer possibilities, while a more complex game has many more possibilities.

Most human endeavors can be modeled as a games: "success" is the satiation we feel from getting what we want, and we explore to get what we want by making choices (making "moves" in the game). Therefore we can study asymmetry in simpler games and extrapolate our learnings to the more complex games we play.

Let's take three games: [Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) (simple), [Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess) (medium complexity), [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) (high complexity). (If you're not familiar with these games, please read a bit about them before proceeding).

Tic Tac Toe is simpler than Chess because there are less possibilities of the game because there are much fewer board positions you can end up at. Similarly Chess is less complex than Go because there are fewer board positions that are possible in the game, meaning less overall possibilities.

We can observe asymmetry in these games in two ways: 
1. Inequality in the values of moves to make
2. Inequality in outcomes

Some moves are obviously better than others, meaning there's a notion of "value" such that the higher the value of a move, the better it is: the more it corresponds with winning (getting what you want).

The greater the asymmetry in moves, the less equal the values of the moves are. In a simple game like Tic Tac Toe, in a competition between two trained players, all moves are valued equally because a draw can always be forced. In a game of Chess (medium complexity), from any given position of the board, there are a range of values for the moves you can make. There are better and worse moves, and there is some difference between the best move and the next best move. In Go, similar to Chess, there are better and worse moves, but the gap between the best move and the next best move is greater than it is in Chess because Go is a more complex game.

Greater asymmetry in moves leads to greater asymmetry of outcomes. We can observe this by seeing the ELO ratings of professionals for these games. "ELO rating" is a way to calculate relative skills of players:

> The difference in the ratings between two players serves as a predictor of the outcome of a match. Two players with equal ratings who play against each other are expected to score an equal number of wins. A player whose rating is 100 points greater than their opponent's is expected to score 64%; if the difference is 200 points, then the expected score for the stronger player is 76%. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system))

It's important to note that the difference in ELO rating doesn't translate linearly to the difference in wins. Someone who is a few hundred ELO rating higher than another will almost certainly win.

In Go, the difference in ELO rating of the top two players is 183 ([https://www.goratings.org/en/](https://www.goratings.org/en/)), whereas in Chess, the difference in ELO rating of the top two Chess players is only 25 ([https://www.chess.com/players](https://www.chess.com/players)).

The gap between the best and the next best is greater in Go than in Chess. Meanwhile there's no need for ELO rating for Tic Tac Toe because every "professional" would draw, meaning everyone's ELO would be zero. Similarly, the gap between the 2nd best and 3rd best is greater the more complex a game is. We observe this in the ELO ratings of professionals in Chess and Go. The more complex the game, the greater the difference in outcome of the nth and the (n+1)th player. 

Asymmetry is not linear. The gap between the best player and the 2nd best player is larger than the gap between the 2nd best player and the 3rd best, and so on. The greater the complexity of the game, the greater the gap between the best and the rest, and the more skewed the curve looks.

Lastly, we should notice that the more complex the game becomes, outcomes (i.e. ELO ratings) become more equal the further you go towards worse players. ***In other words, the more complex the game, the more likely that when two players are equally good it means that they're farther in ability from the best.***

The games we play today to get the things we want are of much, much higher in complexity than the games we discussed above, leading to far greater asymmetry in the actions we take, and in our outcomes.

But, if the games we play have always been more complex than the board games we discussed, then why haven't we always seen a great deal of asymmetry in the world, and importantly, why is it increasing?

That's because the complexity of the games we play is a function of leverage. By leverage I mean: how little time it takes to turn an idea into reality. The greater the leverage available to you, the less time it takes you to turn your ideas into reality.

Human progress increases leverage, and spreads it to more people. For example, when a dictatorship is replaced by a democracy, the citizens gain leverage because they are more free and therefore can manifest their ideas that they previously couldn't. When a new technology is created, it reduces the time it takes to turn your idea into reality, thereby increasing leverage.

Computers, internet, artificial intelligence, government policies, greater individual freedom, etc. all work to increase leverage in the world.

Greater leverage increases the complexity of the games we play in three ways:
1. By reducing the time per move.
2. By eliminating the need to play simpler games (because technology does it for us).
3. By increasing the possibilities within any game, thereby making the game itself more complex.

When it takes a long time to make a move, the underlying asymmetry doesn't manifest quickly. Imagine a game of chess where each move took 5 years to make. By the time the players die, their differences wouldn't be that apparent. It's not that the asymmetry wasn't there, but that it didn't have enough time to present itself.  Over the past decade technology has drastically reduced the time it takes to turn an idea into reality - i.e. the time it takes to make a move, and therefore the underlying asymmetries manifest themselves faster.

As leverage increases, we stop playing simpler games. Before we had computers, a large amount of time and effort was involved in keep track of numbers and basic numerical calculations. As we gained better technology, we were able to shift more of our time to playing more complex games: figuring out what to create and how to create it.

And lastly, games that were always complex become even more complex due to leverage. Our subconscious is limited by the leverage we have available to us. Our minds don't like to dream about things that it believes are impossible. Most filmmakers a century ago likely wouldn't have dreamt of making a film about intergalactic politics, and constrained their ideas to films that could take place in the normal world. As leverage increased, filmmakers were able to dream bigger and wider. Their minds opened up to more possibilities within the same game, making the game itself more complex.

You should have been annoyed that I offered no explanation for how our activities are more complex than Chess and Go.

There is a hierarchy of complexity for human endeavors. The most complex human activities are the ones that involve people and how they feel.

The representational complexity of feeling is far greater than that of Chess or Go. By representational complexity I mean how easy it is to describe the state of the game at any moment in time. A game that has a much more complicated state, likely has many more possibilities for what moves you can take, and is therefore more complex in general.

To see why, recall when you had to communicate how you felt. You'll remember how difficult it is to do so, and importantly that no matter how many words you use, you weren't able to fully, completely, represent your feeling in words. This is because a feeling has a much higher representational complexity than words. Trying to represent a feeling in words is difficult because we are trying to represent something of a higher complexity into a medium that has less complexity. Information is bound to be lost in that translation.

This lost information is precisely what allows for the various interpretations of words. Every single person reading this essay will have different feelings as they read this. Even though my intention is to make you feel what I feel about this topic, there is absolutely no way for me to do so without any loss of information, no matter what medium I use: words, images, videos, symbols, anything - even if I spend my entire life trying. I think this gap between feeling and how well we can communicate it is quite large. <FootnoteReference number={3} />

The representational complexity of Chess and Go can easily be represented by symbols (text, pictures, etc.), and therefore any game in which success is measured by how good you make people feel will be orders of magnitude more complex than Chess and Go (proportional to the difference in complexity between feeling and a sequence of symbols).  The underlying asymmetry that we are moving towards is quite extreme because we are moving towards "feeling games".

A couple of centuries ago, most workers spent their time playing games that weren't directly related to people. For example, they may assemble physical things in a factory and success was measured by how well and fast you could put together multiple parts of a product. As that region progressed, they built better technology, and offshored simpler work to other places, leaving workers to move up complexity towards services that solve more directly for people (marketing, sales, design, etc.).

We notice this trend today as well. Programmers are being asked to become better at thinking about what to build and understanding users, [without just thinking about how to build something](https://x.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1637087219591659520). Animators are being asked to contribute something meaningful to the story instead of only translating a rough sketch into a completed animation. Pizza cooks, and ice cream store employees, are all being asked to tell engaging stories on social media to attract more customers. 

***Everyone is moving towards solving for people.***

Artists for thousands of years have been solving for how to make people feel. Which is why it's no surprise that the arts have always had extreme inequality in outcomes. Human progress is pushing us all towards the games that artists have been playing for a long time, and also towards the intense inequality that artists have felt for a long time.

The real world is not like a board game. Life's not fair. Yet, fairness doesn't reduce inequality, it actually increases it.

Let's imagine a fairy tale world in which every child has loving, caring, supportive parents, the best teachers, and the freedom to explore what they want. Let's say no one is concerned about how to make a living, and everyone has access to great healthcare, a fast fair legal system, etc. And that everyone has very high leverage: anything we imagine can be manifested into reality much more quickly than today.

Have an idea for an app? It'll be manifested in a day. The same for a video, song, etc. If you can imagine an idea and express well enough through some mediums (language, drawing, etc.), then something will turn it into reality quite quickly. In this world, all you will care about is to create things that you want - whether that's art, better tools, physical things, etc.

What do you think the outcomes of this imaginary world would look like?

It would be unfathomably unequal. The richest person in this imaginary world will be stupidly rich. And there would be great variance in outcomes across the board - a smooth curve.

I believe this because in a highly leveraged world, we have more possibilities and we make moves much more quickly. Therefore, slight differences in choices at the start of the game would lead to drastic differences by the time we die due to the complexity of the game.

And not all explorations are equally worthwhile. Someone who spends their entire life learning how to craft the best baskets to sell to their village will not have the same outcomes as someone who explored building software products for large audiences. <FootnoteReference number={4} />

Being influenced slightly differently early on leads to slightly different choices, which will have incredibly large difference in where you end up. The greater the leverage, the greater the difference in where you end up.

Two twins that open up a social app and see two different videos are in influenced in subtly different ways. Each slightly different choice compounds greatly and they will end up in very different places in their exploration of life. The greater the leverage in the world, the more pronounced the difference in how they explore life. 

***Twins born a century ago, on average, would have explored life less differently than twins born today.***

We haven't even taken into account the difference in our abilities at birth. It's silly to think that we're not born with different capabilities, different strengths and weaknesses, different emotional reactions to the same stimuli. Nature is an incredibly complex system - possibly more complex than our feelings. You're deluded if you expect nature to produce two equal things of anything.

In a fair, leveraged world of complex activities, we would see that winners take all.

Unfairness can also cause inequality. But the shape of the inequality caused by unfairness is different than the shape of the inequality caused by a fairness, leverage, and high complexity.

Equality that stems from unfairness is different in that there are more rigid boundaries between classes, and it's more difficult to move from one class to another. Hierarchical caste systems that tell you what you can and cannot do with your life, that you have different rights and potentials than other casts, are incredibly unfair. Even in the industrial revolution, there was a large, rigid divide between workers and those that were able to afford to build factories - quite unfair, but less unfair than the caste systems that gave you absolutely no way to rise. There were at least a dozen factory workers across the entire industrial revolution that were able to start their own factories at some point. The same can't be said about someone born as an "untouchable" who wanted to, say, learn how to read and write.

The graph of outcomes in an unfair world looks like a step function. You will find different classes, and you'll see that there aren't any individuals with outcomes in between the outcomes of the two classes. In other words, all factory workers would make roughly equal outcomes, whereas all factory owners would make roughly equal outcomes, but you'd find very few in between the workers and the owners. This is a symptom of unfairness.

Inequality that stems from a complex world with fairness and leverage is a smoother curve: you will find individuals at all sorts of different outcomes. We can see this in the outcomes for our board game examples: though the difference between the best and the rest is large, if you plotted everyone on a graph, it would be a much smoother curve than the one you would see if you plotted all outcomes in the industrial revolution.

When you look at those curves closely, you'll notice something interesting: the more unfair curves are also more "equal" because they have more people that are making roughly the same, but just divided by classes. Whereas the inequality from fairness and leverage is far less equal because it's tougher to find even a few individuals with the same outcome.

***Therefore, counterintuitively, the way to sniff out unfairness is to see how much equality exists in the outcomes***. The more equality that exists (i.e. the more it looks like a step function), the more cautious we ought to be. And complete equality (like the outcomes of Tic Tac Toe) is fair, but terrible, because it means our activities are not complex enough. It would be fair in that we'd all be equally terrible at life. But what you'll see in any unfair system is that there will always be someone who sits a step above a group of others, who, within their group, have equal outcomes.

There is a lot of unfairness in the world today because there is still too much equality. But it is much better than ever before. Our curve of outcomes is smoother than ever before in modern history.

The idea that a fair world would be equal is delusional. A more fair, more leveraged world will be more unequal in outcomes, because the underlying exploration of life will be more varied. And the inequality that stems from unfairness is actually more equal than the inequality that stems from fairness & leverage.

Human progress makes the world more fair by increasing leverage and spreading it wider.

Today, even in many of the poorest communities around the world, many kids have the ability to create, to speak their minds in ways their grandparents couldn't dream of, and have access to information and knowledge through the internet that is barely less than the richest kid living in a Manhattan high rise.

Yet, it's undeniable that the rich child that has access to higher quality, personalized, feedback, more competent, ambitious peers, a stronger safety net, and more supportive loving parents, has an unfair advantage. We still have a lot of work to do.

Inequality is a function of complexity. The greater the complexity of a game, the more amplified the power law in values of moves and in the outcomes of the game.

The complexity of the games we play is a function of leverage. As leverage increases our activities become more complex.

Leverage is a function of human progress. Every advancement: technology, human rights, medicine, policy, etc. pushes us towards a more leveraged and fair world.

Creating a world in which winners take all.

Inequality is accelerating exponentially because leverage accelerates exponentially.

Global GDP is a rough, but directionally correct, approximation of the leverage in the world. The more leverage that exists in the world means that we are able to turn more ideas into reality, creating and selling more things of higher value.

It's only a rough approximation because it only represents the transactions between us that involve a monetary exchange. There are many transactions that increase due to leverage that aren't yet directly captured by an exchange of money, such as liking posts on social media.

GDP is also a lagging indicator of leverage because it takes time to turn leverage into transactions because even though the time it takes to turn an idea to reality decreases, it's still not instantaneous. Only implemented ideas have an opportunity to impact GDP, so we will see today what today's leverage is after some time, once people have applied today's leverage to create value in the world.

Exponential acceleration of leverage can be seen in our GDP growth: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-gdp-over-the-long-run.

We needed a universal basic income yesterday. Like with other things that change exponentially, we're too slow to act and we suck at cooperating until shit hits the fan.

Yet, a basic income will never "feel enough", or if it does, the feeling won't last. The next breakthrough in medicine, technology, culture, anything will make you crave something that the basic income cannot enable you to have immediately. Such breakthroughs will happen more frequently than ever before.

The only way to get what you want and keep getting what you want is to be the best and stay the best, and the way to do that looks very different than what we think.

### Notes

<Footnotes>
<Footnote number={1}>
You may say that modeling our endeavors as games is reductive. I agree that it is, but I believe it's still directionally correct - that the lessons we extrapolate from smaller games apply to the more complex games each of us plays to get what we want.
</Footnote>

<Footnote number={2}>
There are many ways to measure game complexity, and it's an active space of research. I've tried to provide a simpler definition to work with for now which I believe to be accurate enough for the sake of our discussion, and that any better measure of complexity shouldn't change the conclusions we derive from this.
</Footnote>

<Footnote number={3}>
I believe the difference in representational complexity of feeling and language will determine how long it takes to get to artificial general intelligence that surpasses human capabilities. I also believe that we're quite far away from that. Still, the advancements in the short-term will be rapid.

To be clear, when I say "outcomes" I only mean external outcomes: wealth, status, etc. It could be the case that the person who makes baskets is much happier.
