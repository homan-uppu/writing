title: Winners take all
date: May 2024
---

The world is becoming more hit driven.
- 1% content creators capture most engagement.
- 1% of startups create most value.
- 1% hold most of the world's wealth.

We're just getting started. The gap between the few and the many will sharply rise.

Winners will take all.
- The best creators will capture most value.
- The best doctors will treat everyone.
- The best Pizza cooks will make pizzas for the entire world.
- The best city for startups will become the only one. 
- The most powerful country will dictate global order and culture.

We can't reverse or slow down this shift without slowing down progress. And we wouldn't want to do that. A more fair world with equal access to opportunity, better technology, greater freedom, will have extremely unequal outcomes regardless of how well trained people are.

More complex activities have greater variance in ability regardless of the quality of education and duration of training.

No matter how much training startup founders / creators / marketers have, there is bound to be large variance in ability. By ability I mean how well they can make something people want.

By complexity of an activity I mean the number of possibilities in the activity. A factory worker has a limited number of choices at any given moment in time, leading to few possibilities in how they assemble. An artist on the other hand has an infinite number of choices and possibilities, making their work far more complex.

For simpler activities, with sufficient training, it is possible to become close to the best in terms of ability. The difference in productivity between the best and average factory worker is nowhere near the difference in productivity of the best startup founder and an average one: the average founder fails, and the best one achieves unfathomable outcomes.

This will be true independent of the quality of education. Even if the best entrepreneur or artist coached students 24/7 for decade, they would see a great variance in ability. There will always be some who are just better at making things people want because the activity itself is far more complex.

If we could plot relative ability of professionals on a graph, we would notice it follows a power law distribution. The differences between players is not linear: difference in ability of best to 2nd best is greater than the difference between the 2nd and 3rd best, and so on.

The more complex the activity the more pronounced the differences: the gap in ability between the best creator and the next best is many orders of magnitude greater than the difference between the best factory worker and the next best.

The more complex an activity, the more similar in ability two individuals are, the further from the best they are.

Leverage increases the complexity of the games we play by eliminating the need for simpler activities, and by making complex games even more complex.

Leverage = how little time it takes to implement an idea. The more leverage you have, the less time it takes to manifest your ideas.

Before we had computers, a lot of time was spent crunching numbers. As we gained better technology, we were able to shift more of our time figuring out what to create and how to create it - much more complex activities than crunching numbers.

Greater leverage makes what was once impossible possible, increasing the complexity of an activity. The complexity of building software applications skyrocketed when the world adopted smartphones since there were many more possibilities in what you could build and who you could build for.

Our minds don't dream of ideas it believes are impossible to implement. Greater leverage gives our subconscious minds more confidence to dream wider and bigger, increasing complexity.

An increase in leverage, by definition, increases the rate which we make decisions. When it takes a long time to implement an idea, the underlying inequality between individuals doesn't manifest quickly. In a game of chess in which each move takes 5 years to make, by the time the players die, their differences wouldn't be that apparent. It's not that the inequality in ability wasn't there, but it didn't have enough time to present itself.

The faster we make decisions, the more decisions we make, increasing the weight of each decision as it compounds more aggressively. With greater leverage, small difference in ability (in decision making) leads to a far greater difference in outcomes. A slightly better player in a long, complex, fair, game making moves rapidly will almost always win.

We are moving towards a "winners take all" world because:
1. Our activities are becoming more complex due to greater leverage, leading to a greater inequality in ability independent of the quality of education or duration of training.
2. As our ideas are implemented more quickly, we make faster decisions which leads to greater compounding. Small differences in ability will correspond to larger differences in outcomes.
3. As equality of opportunity increases and the world becomes even more connected, there will be more ferocious competition, leading to more creation which increases leverage and amplifies the gap between the best and the rest.
4. As our world becomes more fair: individuals will be more accurately compensated for the value they create. As leverage increases, the best will increasingly capture most of the value. Wealth redistribution has a limit that will not be crossed (as I'll explain below). The wealth gap between the best and the rest will be enormous.

In a fair, highly leveraged, world with equal opportunity, the best take most.

There are two kinds of opportunity: one determined by birth, and the other determined by access to tools, education, freedom.

It's silly to think that we're not born with different capabilities, personalities, emotional tendencies, inclinations. No two trees are the same. No two rocks are the same. People are not created equal. For any complex activity, some will have a nature given advantage over others.

It's dangerous to create equality at birth because that would mean wiping out what makes us unique. We underestimate the impact of our biology on the way we are: personalities, tendencies, inclinations, perspectives. Editing our genes to be similar in order to create true equality of opportunity will cause our species to fail due to lack of diversity. 

We ought to double down on what makes us unique, not eliminate it.

Inequality in access to tools, education and freedom is unfair. This is a problem. Our world is becoming more fair, but we have a lot of work to do.

Fairness and unfairness both cause inequality in outcomes, but their shape is different. The shape of outcomes in an unfair world looks like a step function, whereas the shape of outcomes for complex activities in a fair world looks like a smooth [power law curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law).

Unfair systems tell you what you can and cannot do with your life. They have rigid class boundaries, each with different privileges and freedoms. Unfair systems lead to outcomes that look like a step function: there aren't any individuals with outcomes in between the outcomes of the classes. 

- All slaves in ancient Egypt had equal outcomes, and you wouldn't find anyone with outcomes between the slaves and the class above them. 
- All factory workers had similar outcomes, and you'd find very few with outcomes between the workers and the owners.

On the other hand, fair systems, such as a group of professional Chess players, will have unequal outcomes along a smooth curve. The curve is more extreme the more complex the game is, how quickly they make moves, and how long the game lasts.

Complete equality is possible in a fair world, but only when the activity is simple. No complex activity, in a fair world, will have completely equal outcomes. If it seems that there are completely equal outcomes for a complex activity, you won't have to look far to find the one that sits above everyone else.

Upward mobility is difficult in a fair, leveraged world because of how hard it is to know what you can be the best at that the world values and training to become great at it, not because of less access to opportunity. This will be increasingly clear as our world becomes more fair.

Therefore difficulty in upward mobility can't be used as a measure of unfairness. That's like saying Chess is unfair because I can't be a professional chess player that can earn a living playing chess. I probably couldn't be one no matter how hard I trained. Life is not fair while the game can be.

We are accelerating towards a winners take all world. Inequality will rise sharply in the next few years greater than the rise in inequality over the past century, if not more. It will shock us.

Leverage accelerates exponentially, causing more pronounced inequality of outcomes.

Global GDP is a rough, but directionally correct, approximation of the leverage in the world. The greater the leverage, the more rapidly we can implement better ideas, thereby increasing our transactions in volume and value.

GDP is only an approximation because it only represents the transactions between us that involve a monetary exchange. There are many transactions that increase due to leverage that aren't yet directly captured by an exchange of money.

GDP is also a lagging indicator of leverage because it takes time for leverage to be reflected as transactions. Only good ideas that are implemented will impact GDP, so we will only see what today's leverage is after people have used it to create things.

As more transactions are monetized, and the faster we can implement ideas, GDP becomes a better approximation of leverage.

Global GDP is [growing exponentially fast](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-gdp-over-the-long-run), therefore leverage is growing exponentially fast, and so will the complexity of our activities, and so will inequality in ability - accelerating us towards a winners take all world exponentially fast.

There will be no middle class: those that aren't one of the best will no longer be able to contribute to the economy. 

When the best generate orders of magnitude greater outcomes than the rest, it becomes economically unfeasible for anyone but one of the best to be hired. A middle class was only possible in a world with far less complex activities in which the gap in ability between the best and the average was much lower, and far less leverage such that differences in ability wouldn't manifest quickly due to slower compounding.

In theory everyone can be the best at something that the world values, but in practice this is very difficult to achieve, and even if we can, it will take a very long time. Even then, there will be individuals who's natural strengths only allow them to become the best at something the world does not value much, or does not value during their lifetime. There will also be some who will fail to efficiently discover what they can be one of the best at.

Therefore, we need a universal basic income that grows in proportion to leverage.

A basic income won't "feel enough". If it ever does, the feeling will be fleeting because the next breakthrough in medicine, technology, culture, etc. will make you crave something that you cannot afford with the basic income. Such breakthroughs will happen far more frequently. By relying on a basic income you will perpetually want things feel like basic necessities - that will be out of reach.

A basic income will never be so high that the outcomes of the best will be anywhere close the outcomes of the average because such a distribution does not maximize GDP growth.

"Winners take all" applies to the global economy as well. Countries that fail to compete on GDP will be subjected to a modern version of colonialism: they will need help from winners,  and any help with come with conditions. Those that receive aid will be forced to reduce their basic income to whatever amount optimizes GDP growth, and their unique culture will be engulfed by the cultures of winners. We are already seeing early signs of this.

Countries, in order to survive won't be able to raise basic income so high that it kills their ability to compete. Those that do will be forced to reduce it when they receive aid. Swimming against these incentives will become more difficult as leverage increases and the gap between the most powerful country and the rest increases.

No individual country writes these incentives, the winning country is only better at optimizing for the incentives. These are the incentives of a group of organisms in which each organism wants things and wants to get what it wants as quickly as possible. I believe we would see the same incentives in any alien civilization that is at least as intelligent as we are, given enough time - if they too want things and want to get what they want as quickly as possible. They too will become winners take all. To reverse these incentives we would need to reverse the underlying cause. Good luck.

Don't rely on a basic income to get what you want; only treat it as a launching pad to:

Discover what you can be great at, that the world values (or will value in your lifetime) and become the best you can be at it. Leave the rest to nature.
