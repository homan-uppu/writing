title: Winners take all
date: May 2024
---

The world is becoming more hit driven.
- 1% content creators capture most engagement.
- 1% of startups create most value.
- 1% hold most of the world's wealth.

We're just getting started. The gap between the few and the many will sharply rise.

Winners will take all.
- The best creators will capture most value.
- The best doctors will treat everyone.
- The best Pizza cooks will make pizzas for the entire world.
- The best city for startups will become the only one. 
- The most powerful country will dictate global order and culture.

- Be the best at what you do.
- Or find something else you can be the best at and double down.
- Or create something new that the world will value and be the best at it. 
- Be the best.

We can't reverse or slow down this shift without slowing down progress. And we wouldn't want to do that. A more fair world with equal access to opportunity, better technology, greater freedom, will have extremely unequal outcomes regardless of how well trained everyone is.

...

Inequality in ability is a function of complexity. In games, complexity corresponds to the number of possibilities within the game. A simpler game has fewer possibilities, while a more complex game has many more possibilities. The greater the complexity of the game, the greater the inequality in ability, no matter how hard the players train.

Our endeavors can be modeled as a games: "success" is the satiation we feel from getting what we want, and we explore by making choices ("moves") in the game. By modeling our endeavors as games, we can study simpler games and extrapolate learnings from them.

Let's look at three popular board games: [Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) (simple), [Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess) (medium complexity), [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) (high complexity).

Tic Tac Toe is simpler than Chess because there are less possibilities (less possible board positions), and similarly Chess is simpler than Go.

We can observe inequality in these games in two ways:
1. Inequality in choices
2. Inequality in ability

Some choices are obviously better than others, meaning there's a notion of "value" such that the higher the value of a choice, the better it is: the more it corresponds with getting what you want.

In a simple game like Tic Tac Toe, in a competition between two trained players, there are only two values for all choices that correspond to drawing or losing - because a draw can always be forced by trained players. In Chess, from any given position of the board, there is a much wider range of values for choices: some are terrible, some are bad, some are good, and some are excellent. In Go, there is an even wider range of values of choices than in Chess because it is a more complex game.

As game complexity increases, how we use our minds changes. For simpler games we can rely fully on our rational mind to calculate the best move. The more complex the game is, the more we rely on intuition because we can't calculate all possibilities. Intuition determines which branches you calculate for, and choosing which branch to calculate for becomes more important than raw calculation speed as game complexity increases.

The more a game relies on intuition, the more unequal the abilities between players become no matter how much training the players have. We can observe this by seeing the ELO ratings of professionals for these games. "ELO rating" is a way to calculate relative skills of players:

> The difference in the ratings between two players serves as a predictor of the outcome of a match. Two players with equal ratings who play against each other are expected to score an equal number of wins. A player whose rating is 100 points greater than their opponent's is expected to score 64%; if the difference is 200 points, then the expected score for the stronger player is 76%. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system))

Difference in ELO rating doesn't translate linearly to the difference in wins. Someone who is a few hundred ELO rating higher than another will almost certainly win.

In Go, the difference in ELO rating of the top two players is 183 ([https://www.goratings.org/en/](https://www.goratings.org/en/)), whereas in Chess, the difference in ELO rating of the top two Chess players is only 25 ([https://www.chess.com/players](https://www.chess.com/players)).

The gap between the best and the next best is greater in Go than in Chess. Meanwhile there's no need for ELO rating for Tic Tac Toe because every "professional" would draw: everyone's ELO is 0.

Inequality is not linear. The gap between the best player and the 2nd best player is larger than the gap between the 2nd best player and the 3rd best, and so on. The greater the complexity of the game, the greater the gap between the best and the rest, and the more skewed the curve looks.

***The more complex the game, the more equal players are in ability, the further they are from the best.***

Inequality in ability is independent how much training the players have. The players we've referenced above have dedicated their entire lives to becoming great at their game, and yet we see inequality because training for complex games leads to greater variance in ability - by nature.

We are moving towards a "winners take all" world because our activities are becoming more complex (much more than Chess / Go) leading to an inequality in ability no matter how hard you train. And small differences in ability increasingly result in disproportionately large outcomes.

Both are a result of increase in leverage. Leverage = how little time it takes to implement an idea. The more leverage you have, the less time it takes to manifest your ideas.

Leverage increases the complexity of the games we play by eliminating the need to play simpler games (technology does it for us), and by making complex games even more complex.

Before we had computers, a lot of time was spent crunching numbers. As we gained better technology, we were able to shift more of our time figuring out what to create and how to create it - much more complex activities than crunching numbers.

Our minds don't like to dream about things that it believes are impossible. Greater leverage gives us more confidence to dream wider and bigger, creating more possibilities within the same game, making the game itself more complex. <FootnoteReference number={2} />

An increase in leverage, by definition, also increases the rate which we can make moves. When it takes a long time to make a move, the underlying inequality between players doesn't manifest quickly. Imagine a game of chess where each move took 5 years to make. By the time the players die, their differences wouldn't be that apparent. It's not that the inequality in ability wasn't there, but it didn't have enough time to present itself. 

The greater the leverage, smaller differences in ability lead to larger differences in outcome because there is more compounding. In a fair, complex game, each decision a player makes carries greater weight as it impacts many more decisions that come after it.

With greater leverage, players can go much deeper into the game. The deeper they go in the tree of possibilities, the more different their explorations are.

Unlike board games, life's not fair.

There are two kinds of fairness: fairness at birth and fairness in access to tools, education, freedoms, and opportunity.

It's silly to think that we're not born with different capabilities, different emotional reactions to the same stimuli, different personalities, different inclinations. The more complex a system, the more difficult it is to find two things that are equal: in Go, there are fewer equal board positions (in which both players have equal chance of winning) than in Chess or Tic Tac Toe. Nature is an incredibly complex system in which finding two things that are equal is almost impossible. No two trees are the same, no two rocks are the same. People are not created equal. 

The greater the leverage, the more our differences are magnified and the more clear it will be that for some games, some just have an unfair nature given advantage. We cannot compete with them if they choose to cultivate their advantage. Life is unfair. 

It's dangerous to make life completely fair at birth because that would mean wiping out our individual mutations that make us unique. We underestimate the impact of our biology on our personalities, perspectives, emotions. If we succeed at making birth fair, our species will fail because we will not have the diversity required to survive. Our job is to find our unique, nature given differences and double down on them, not eliminate them.

Outside of unfairness of birth, we've come a long way. Even in many of the poorest communities around the world, many kids have the ability to create, and speak their minds in ways their grandparents couldn't dream of. They have access to knowledge through the internet that is barely any less than the richest kid in the world. 

Yet, the rich child who has access to better personalized feedback, more competent peers, a stronger safety net, and more supportive parents, has an unfair advantage. We must give everyone the rich kid's advantage.

By solving fairness we will not have similar outcomes, but rather greater inequality because more people will have access to greater leverage and they will help us more rapidly increase leverage. And greater leverage increases difference in outcomes for the same difference in ability.

Unfairness can also cause inequality. But the shape of outcomes in an unfair world looks like a step function, whereas the shape of outcomes in a fair world looks like a smooth [power law curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law).

Unfair systems that tell you what you can and cannot do with your life, that have rigid class boundaries, that give some less rights than others are unfair and lead to outcomes that look like a step function: there aren't any individuals with outcomes in between the outcomes of the classes. In a more unfair world, all factory workers had equal outcomes, whereas all factory owners would have similar outcomes, but you'd find very few outcomes in between the workers and the owners.

Fair systems, such as a group of professional Chess players, will have unequal outcomes that look like a smooth [power law curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law). The curve is more extreme the more complex the game is, how quickly they make moves, and how long the game lasts.

Complete equality is possible in a fair world, but only when the activity is simple (like Tic Tac Toe). No complex activity, in a fair world, will have completely equal outcomes. If it seems that there are completely equal outcomes for a complex game, you won't have to look far to find the one that sits above everyone else (who within themselves have equal outcomes).

Upward mobility will become more difficult in a fair, leveraged world because winners take all, and those not the best in what they do won't be able to contribute to the economy. Therefore you can't say a system is less fair because moving upwards is difficult. That's like saying Chess is unfair because I can't be as good as Magnus Carlsen. I probably wouldn't be as good as him no matter how hard I trained. Life is not fair while the game can be.

The greater the complexity of a game, the greater the inequality in ability no matter how hard you train, and a greater gap between the best and the rest. The greater the leverage, the more complex the games we play, and the more disproportionately large outcomes for the same difference in ability due to greater compounding. A more fair world creates more people with access to leverage who help increase leverage even faster.

Winners will take all.

Inequality is accelerating exponentially, not linearly. Inequality will rise sharply in the next few years greater than the rise in inequality over the past century, if not more. It will shock us.

Inequality accelerates exponentially because leverage accelerates exponentially.

Global GDP is a rough, but directionally correct, approximation of the leverage in the world. The more leverage that exists in the world means that we are able to implement more, and better, ideas, thereby increasing our transactions and the value of our transactions.

GDP is only an approximation because it only represents the transactions between us that involve a monetary exchange. There are many transactions that increase due to leverage that aren't yet directly captured by an exchange of money. As it becomes faster to implement ideas, GDP will become a better approximation.

GDP is also a lagging indicator of leverage because it takes time to turn leverage into transactions. Only good ideas that are implemented will impact GDP, so we will only see what today's leverage is after people have used it to create.

Global GDP is [growing exponentially fast](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-gdp-over-the-long-run), therefore leverage is growing exponentially fast, and so will the complexity of our activities, and so will inequality - accelerating us towards a winners take all world exponentially fast.

There is no longer any stagnation, only accelerated growth or accelerated death. We will feel the impact of each choice we make more strongly than ever before because the number of choices we make in our lives increases with leverage, and therefore each choice compounds more aggressively.

In a hit driven world there is no middle class: those that aren't one of the best will no longer be able to contribute to the economy.

In theory everyone can be the best at something unique to them that the world values, but in practice this is very difficult to achieve, and even if we do, it will take a very long time. Even then, there will be individuals who's unique strengths only allow them to become the best at something the world does not value.

Therefore, we need a universal basic income that grows in proportion to leverage. Like with other things that change exponentially, we're too slow to act, and we suck at cooperating until shit hits the fan.

A basic income will never "feel enough", or if it does, the feeling will be fleeting. The next breakthrough in medicine, technology, culture, anything will make you crave something that the basic income will not afford. Such breakthroughs will happen more frequently than ever before. By relying on a basic income you will perpetually want things out of your reach that you will consider to be basic necessities.

A basic income will never be so high that the outcomes of the best will be anywhere close the outcomes of most because such a distribution does not maximize GDP growth.

"Winners take all" applies to the global economy as well. Countries that fail to compete on GDP will be subjected to a modern version of colonialism: they will require help from winners, and that help with come with conditions that will force them to be more like the winners. Their basic income will fall to what optimizes GDP growth, and their unique culture will be engulfed by the cultures of winners. Countries, in order to survive, will compete on GDP and won't raise basic income so high that it kills their ability to compete. Swimming against these incentives will become more difficult as leverage increases.

Don't rely on a basic income to get what you want; only treat it as a launching pad to be the best at something.

---

The only way to get what you want and keep getting what you want is to be the best and stay the best. The way to do that looks very different than what we think: working anxiously till exhaustion probably hurts more than helps. Building the right intuition is a delicate skill that requires the right kind of effort, in the right way.

The path is difficult, but if you tread it well you will be unstoppable.

### Notes

<Footnotes>
<Footnote number={1}>
You may say that modeling our endeavors as games is reductive. I agree that it is, but I believe it's still directionally correct - that the lessons we extrapolate from smaller games apply to the more complex games each of us plays to get what we want.
</Footnote>

<Footnote number={2}>
There are many ways to measure game complexity, and it's an active space of research. I've tried to provide a simpler definition to work with for now which I believe to be accurate enough for the sake of our discussion, and that any better measure of complexity shouldn't change the conclusions we derive from this.
</Footnote>

<Footnote number={3}>
I believe the difference in representational complexity of feeling and language will determine how long it takes to get to artificial general intelligence that surpasses human capabilities. I also believe that we're quite far away from that. Still, the advancements in the short-term will be rapid.

To be clear, when I say "outcomes" I only mean external outcomes: wealth, status, etc. It could be the case that the person who makes baskets is much happier.
