1. Singular focus on a single essay: Education in a post-AGI world - that clearly explains the problem I see & paints a compelling vision of the future.
2. An excellent video to accompany the essay - to explain it in a more visually engaging way.
3. High effort outreach: get feedback from many people before publishing.
	1. At least 20 well connected people ready to repost it when you "launch" it.

asides:
- update personaltoken.vc to make it feel more early stage (similar to: https://eurekalabs.ai/). the optics matter. and having something this simple is actually a positive signal at this stage.
