Feeling better.

What a joy it is in the afternoon when my body has fully settled from a hunger perspective. And that's when the mind becomes lighter, sharper, naturally. It's a beautiful feeling, but don't be attached to it because it too shall pass :).

And it passed with that conversation. I don't want to give my time to absolutely anyone right now. I'm selfish.

---

I just have to build patience for the execution. That's absolutely all I have to do.
I don't have a problem with ideas at all. I just lack the patient, persistent execution. And that's what I'm going to nail with everything that I do from here on out. Amen.

Don't worry too much about the morning sits. Put in more effort from tomorrow onwards. Find a way to stay awake.

Look, if you're feeling guilt, then you have to deal with it internally. Don't let your mind travel to imaginations, etc. they're not going to be healthy, nor will they be helpful. The most effective processing is an internal one.

Your life depends a lot on executing this single product to the absolute best of your abilities. The results aren't in your hands, so leave that. But the execution must be the absolute best you can do. Amen.

Yeah, just deal with all the sensations that will discomfort you during this process. Just deal with them patiently and persistently.
