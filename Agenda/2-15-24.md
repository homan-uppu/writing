1. A more inspired redesign. Clean. Minimal. Beautiful. Let's get it. Take the time you need to design this well. Dedicate as much time as you need to the design process. Let's go.
2. Post the design on thread, and THEN get to building it out. Amen.
3. Hopefully get the "live" version of design by e.o.d (no wiring up yet. Just be able to interact with everything. Amen.)

This is not a competition. Do the best you can. Use everything as an inspiration. Amen.
That was a great start to the day. It was inspiring from a design perspective. I'm not anywhere close to the level of design I want to be at, so I'm going to take another stab at the design. I really want it to "click" with me. Seriously.
