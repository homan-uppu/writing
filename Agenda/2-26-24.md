1. Finish first essay, get it ready to publish.
2. After publishing, app.

The first essay will go out this Friday.

I need to fix a writing schedule and stick to it. (Just the first 2 hours of every single day. That's solid. And don't move to next essay until the current one is published. Need to have that sort of determination to see things through. Amen.) This writing cadence will continue moving forward. After having momentum (and building some writing muscle), reduce the writing cadence to 1 hour a day.
