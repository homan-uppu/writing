From tomorrow onwards, don't budge from the app until your self MVP is done. I need to bring it to that stage and use it more extensively. Continue to take notes on things I want to write about (in the app), but don't worry about them just yet.

I think the right cadence is one essay per week (at the lowest end). If you're inspired and flesh out a great essay quickly, then ofc don't hesitate to put it out there.
