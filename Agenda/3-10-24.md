1. Write about the **inner war**.
2. **Write about my desires**. The more I stay here, the more I feel my freedom is cramped. What is the life I want to live, and what will it take for me to lead that life? There is a part of me that wants to break free and live completely according to my terms. But you definitely need to evaluate this with a more balanced mind.

There is absolutely nothing more important than to lay this thinking foundation.
I can't imagine having clarity about what to work on, and how to approach it, without this foundation of thinking. It simply doesn't make sense.

Also, doing something else because my mind doesn't "feel like writing" is the worst reason to do something. If this is truly the reason, then find a way to get the mind to do what you want it to do, rather than shy away from the challenge.

Amen.

- No dinner today. Just drink the shake and pass out. I need to cut back on the food for sure, else I'm going to miss my target weight, which is slipping because I'm eating too heavy.
- Pay ACT bill.
- Get in some good pushups sessions through the day. I've been slacking on the physical health.
