1. Write out the thoughts I had this morning.
2. More writing! I'd like the first section fleshed out today, sufficiently well (i.e. passable as a first draft).
3. Big picture organization: every day I'm having plenty of thoughts on other sections. I think it's time to take some high level notes of all the things that I want to cover in the other sections without worrying about organization (think of as a brain dump).

I guess, in this phase, I am a writer. Own it. Lean into the identity. And don't stop short of sufficient clarity.

I'm going to take a different approach to today's writing: fast. I'm going as soon as I feel like I have some sense of what direction to take, I'm going to blitz it. Outline first, and then get to the prose right away.

Let's see how this works. Amen.
