I also have to think deeply about ensuring that I don't perform actions that create great agitation inside. And yesterday, I directly created strong agitation that I'm still feeling the aftereffects from. It's not pretty, but I need to internalize the need to avoid actively clouding my judgement.

How clear your mind is, is how clear your life will be. You need to follow the book you're writing and solely focus on reducing self-delusion. That ought to be your highest priority. Seriously. Nothing else even comes close.

Amen brother. Amen.
