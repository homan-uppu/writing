Today I have the necessary context to write until the end of the first part (through the power law, comparing masters from novices, and what makes us suck at seeking truth - a first principles analysis given our model about where we screw up).

It's important to take the time to do this right. This really is the foundation for the work you'll be doing in life.

Move fast, as you should, but don't miss out on sufficient nuance and self-criticism of your beliefs so that you are also right, and you find the right way to present these ideas.

And there are a lot of ideas to present here. You will not be able to fit it into a single essay. And I most definitely the need to compile all of the essays into some longer form medium (perhaps a really long video / film / interactive book of sorts).

Think about the presentation later - it's not important right now. What's most important is seeking truth. That's all you have to do. And you must do it well.

The Buddha is the most inspiring seeker of truth for me because of his sheer ambition and will. But I'm also finding great inspiration from other seekers such as Charles Darwin, Akira Kurosawa, Paul Graham, etc. Charles Darwin had quite an intense truth seeking journey to build the theory of evolution. Fascinating.
