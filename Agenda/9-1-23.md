Evening agenda:
- Come what may, I'm going to get a draft of the essay done tonight. Come what may. No matter fucking what. This nonsense has gone on long enough. I need to impose strong external forcing functions, else I'm going to fall to the wayside. Holy fuck. C'mon brother. You need to craft it asap. No more waiting. -> you've thought about this topic for fucking years. Get it out of your damn system brother. Seriously.

1. **Thorough brain dump of the education post**. -> Have nothing left in your brain about this topic. Only then the sculpting / processing begins.
2. **Actually get to designing the writing feedback system**. Give it a serious one page treatment + a session in Figma. -> The vision for the product will determine how I train the model, so yes, this is the first step.
3. **Make a decision on publishing cadence**. (This is a tough one), and what you're going to publish about. The "what" is pretty clear: learning & technology.
4. **Thoughts on note-taking in general**. I think there's something here. The best note-taking app. Period. What's lacking in your current one? Intelligence. But it's also not clear how intelligence would even be useful. Pipe dream.

This is a big day. Grind through it hard. Amen.
