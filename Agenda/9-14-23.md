I think writing as the "final form" will drop in relevance, while writing as a skill will become more valuable - as a means to create, and intermediary, approximate, representation of what you want, and to build clarity.

Because of what good writing does to your mind. It will always be relevant.

Do a long session here (at least until 3pm), and then straight back home. No wandering around. The noose is getting tighter. It's time to deliver. Amen.
