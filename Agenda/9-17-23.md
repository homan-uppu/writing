1. Knock out the **draft**. (enough iterations to get to very close friends)
2. **Design and build the site**.
3. **Send draft out to early readers**.
4. Start working on next essay. Freeze the upcoming 3 essays and quickly churn out blurbs for them to validate the positioning.

You don't have the time you think you have. Grind and get this out asap.

Essay next steps:
- Concluding thoughts
- The entire intro section: now that you've talked about everything you want to, start the essay with a powerful bang that lets the reader know what's to come, and gets them excited for the journey. Amen.

With this, the first draft will be done. Then it's time for the rounds of iterations. At this point, focus on getting the website ready before you start the iterations. I want to see the essay in its final form as I edit it. Amen.
