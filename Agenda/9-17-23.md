1. Knock out the **draft**. (enough iterations to get to very close friends)
2. **Design and build the site**.
3. **Send draft out to early readers**.
4. Start working on next essay. Freeze the upcoming 3 essays and quickly churn out blurbs for them to validate the positioning.

You don't have the time you think you have. Grind and get this out asap.
