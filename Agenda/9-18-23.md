**Writing**
1. **Essay**.
2. **Start drafts of upcoming essays**. Need to take a **staggered approach** to speed this process up. Amen. **I can't take this long for subsequent essays**. I simply don't have the time. Absolutely.

**Health**
- Research a **pelvic floor workout program**, and carve out a 20 min sesh in the afternoon (after the main writing session) to implement it every day.
- **Meal comes after evening Yoga**, NOT before. The before just doesn't work. And restrict to only one meal. In fact: just one plateful. One sitting.
- Keto. Cut back on carbs and especially the sugars. Amen.

Remember: you only need 5 high quality feedback givers. After that, it's time to publish. Amen.

This process could honestly take a couple more days. I only want to send for feedback when I feel like it accurately portrays my thoughts and feelings about this topic. If it doesn't, or my thinking needs work, then I can't really send it out, no? Actually, no. I ought to send out even if not fully there because there's a chance that a high level feedback could change the direction in ways that will require a rewrite anyways.

Let's find out.
