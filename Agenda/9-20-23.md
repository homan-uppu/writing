1. Solid draft of the essay, and send it out for feedback. It's time to get this out to the world. Amen.
2. Bring some clarity to big picture, **start next draft**.
3. **Put some thought into product thinking** - perhaps take some time to design. A good design and explanation can also be another essay. Amen.

Chores:
- Buy some running shorts + t-shirts online. Get them shipped.

It's time. I'm **committed** to the daily am workouts.

Let the first week be unstructured: go to the Ferry building and do some sprints, pushups, pullups at the Mission Bay field. And we'll go from there.

Get the body used to more rigorous, consistent workouts.
Keep Ashtanga as it is.

Shoes will be arriving today, so I'll start the running regimen tomorrow morning. Amen. It's time to build the body back up healthily. My running program is a critical aspect of that.

I'm skipping food on Saturday - will still do a shorter weight training session in the evening that day though. Amen.

I swear I'm going to get into the shape of my life (from a **low body fat percentage**, not muscle mass or any other visual aspect). I have some stubborn fat due to metabolic syndrome. I'm going to reverse this. Amen.
