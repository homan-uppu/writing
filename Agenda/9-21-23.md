1. Completely ignore the college essay for the day - will edit it with a fresh mind tomorrow. Select the next essay and get to work. Amen.

Spend some time thinking about the way you're going to write this (i.e. you want it to flow better, no writer's block and just get the draft out quickly).

Think about why it took so long to get to a draft for the first essay. Reflect. And take some inspiration from other writers.
