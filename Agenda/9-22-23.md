**Session**:
- Transcribe the 3 audio notes. Have a good system in place to transcribe drafts of all of my upcoming essays. Amen.
- Edit draft of "Skills that matter"
- Edit draft of "Algorithm vs. artistry" - and importantly, find an angle here, the right positioning: this title doesn't work / make sense as it is, and the essay needs to be narrowed in its focus.
- Iterate on "Why college is outdated" - until it's good enough.
- Aggressively approach growth: get the essay in front of the people that you want feedback from. This is the only path.

----

1. Drafts of **2 new essays** through dictation.
2. Iterations of "**Why college is outdated**".

----

Push through the draft on rewarding curation. And do it through dictation.

From now on, try all first drafts through dictation. Only get to the computer for the editing phase.

I have a feeling this is going to work out really well. My speaking flows far better than my writing. It would only make sense that my dictation would flow much better than my typing.

Let's try it out. Amen.
