1. Knock out draft of essay first thing - this is top priority. Get this close to publishing.
2. Just get site to where it needs to be. Stop fucking with it so much.

Today, I need this draft done. Come what may. I have all the thoughts in my mind. I just need to put it down and edit it. Don't take longer than you should. Amen.

As much as I want to find a "shortcut", the reality is that there's no other way :). If you can't even write, you have no shot at building the right product. Absolutely not.

You have to be bought into this process, and lean into the suffering while relaxing the mind. Amen.
