### Extreme asymmetry

And seeking asymmetries well requires a healthy fear response to equality.

Even if we may intellectually agree that asymmetries exist to a great degree, our emotional response to situations is almost certainly off the mark: we will continue to operate in incredibly suboptimal ways because our subconscious, our habits, aren't aligned with the reality of the asymmetries in world.

Having the appropriate emotional response to situations so that we uncover the underlying asymmetries is incredibly counterintuitive for almost all of us because for most of human history such an extreme asymmetry didn't exist. It wasn't the case that only a tiny sliver of decisions accounted for most outcomes, or that a tiny difference in ability between two individuals led to one radically outperforming the other by orders of magnitudes. And therefore our collective culture, education, and even evolutionary programming hasn't given us the necessary intuition to perceive inequality accurately.

Now, if the world wasn't changing rapidly, you'd probably be fine not worrying about seeking asymmetries. But, the world is accelerating towards far more extreme asymmetry, and therefore not cultivating the skill to sniff it out will hold us back individually and collectively from getting what we want - whatever that may be.
