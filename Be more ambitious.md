Many of the world's problems stems from lack of ambition.

I don't think it's possible to create ambition where there isn't. But I do believe it's possible to cultivate a seed of ambition if you have it.

To be clear, ambition is a disease. It literally causes suffering. An ambitious individual will be drawn to do things in the world quite intensely. They'd feel incredibly uncomfortable in situations where they can't do the work they want to do with the intensity they want to do it with.

I believe ambition is also grounded in the ego. Someone without a large ego probably wouldn't wake up one day with the arrogance thinking that they can change a system that's been rotting for centuries, or that they can create something so great that the world wouldn't have seen anything like it before.

So there's nothing to celebrate about ambition itself. But from a collective perspective, our world is literally pushed forward by the ambitious. Most positive outcomes in the world are due to a tiny percentage of ideas - which are often incredibly ambitious.

(This ought to be the intro - start with the qualifier and tell the triggered folks to gtfo because I'm not here to chat with them. This is for those who suffer in the way that I do).

Ambition is a disease. It literally causes a lack of ease - which is what "disease" means.

You only have 2 options: train your mind to become less ambitious, or cultivate your ambition. If you can do the former, I recommend it. You'll may be happier as a result.

But that's only possible if the disease hasn't spread too much. If you're reading this you probably suffer from the disease to such an extent that you'd scoff at the idea of curbing it. The rest of this essay is for you.

If you're ambitious and you don't want to (i.e. can't) curb it, then you only have on option: take it to the extreme. Staying at an average level ambition will do you more harm than good.

To see why, we have to unpack what it even means to be ambitious, and why some of us suffer from this disease.

...

Ambition becomes a problem for the world only when you aren't ambitious enough, or you aren't competent enough at seeking truth.

...

Something something, someone that has great political ambitions and wants absolute power only harms the world if they're not ambitious enough, and if they're not good at seeking truth. Those are the two dimensions that matter.

(Continue this example to show how he would actually benefit the world with greater ambition).

Great ambition actually makes actions more beneficial for the world. And ofc it must be balanced with great competence in seeking truth. Ambition without competence in seeking truth can be disastrous. And the latter without ambition is pointless: it's like having a strong rowing ability without the desire to go far. What's the point?
