(Definitely need a clickbait title for this one).

This would need to be a super long, comprehensive analysis of the skills you need.

Take some key examples of individuals that have charted their own paths (Levelsio, creators, etc.), and try to **craft a learning path** based on what worked.

- Core skills.
	- How to make friends. How to get involved in communities.
	- Writing & reading (these go hand in hand, inseparable).
	 - Mental health / mindset.
- Exploration, then exploitation.
- What does an "in demand skill" even mean? Need to gauge how robust it is.
- Judgement

-> This is the essay that you'd need some solid feedback on. Have a set of people that you can reach out to a couple of weeks in advance, to hopefully get their feedback before you publish.
