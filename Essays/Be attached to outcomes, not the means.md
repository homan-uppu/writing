When someone fears the impact AI will have on their work, it's usually because they're attached to the process itself, rather than the value their work creates. Their identity is tied to the process, and therefore tools that invalidate the process they're used to are threats to their identity.

By attaching yourself with outcomes and not the means to generate those outcomes, your identity isn't threatened when more powerful tools are invented that invalidate your process. In fact, AI benefits you. As AI becomes more powerful you become more powerful because more intelligent tools enable you to generate the outcomes you want more quickly.

Technology is advancing exponentially. This means that the ways to create will be re-invented more rapidly than ever before.

You could get away with being attached to the process in previous generations, because it could take decades for new technologies to completely redefine what it means to do your work. Today, we no longer have this luxury of delayed technological adoption. New technologies are adopted almost instantly [1], on a massive scale.

The only way to thrive is to focus on outcomes while being hyper flexible on the means.
