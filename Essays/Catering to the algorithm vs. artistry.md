I think at some point in our lives, we start to care a lot about how we're perceived by others and the world. There's this fear of judgment, this fear of standing out too much, this fear of pushback, ostracization, of being kicked out of the community or the world or the country or whatever that you belong to. There's this fear of being judged.

I think this craving for external validation is so deeply rooted in all of us. And I mean, it makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint. If you care a lot about what other people think about you, and you're not too deviant, you don't deviate too much from society's norms and expectations, then you're more likely to be protected by the society that you're in. And so from an evolutionary standpoint, it makes sense why most of us inherently fear coming off in a way that stands out too much.

And then when we realize this, we end up overcompensating sometimes and appearing unique and different at the surface level as sort of a pushback onto the system. So that we can assert our freedom from it. But very few of us can go beyond that surface level dance and actually be free and not care. I'm not there yet. And I know very few people that are. And those that are, don't have to do some superficial dance to visibly externally assert their freedom from the system. They just are. They just do themselves.

And with that wisdom, they also become more quiet. And there's just a certain way about it. And obviously, you know, you can't just look at someone and if they let's say are silent, then just assume that they're wise as well. I mean, it doesn't go that doesn't go in reverse. It just happens to be that those that end up becoming more wise and freeing their mind from the craving for external validation, they just happen to be quieter and feel less of a need to superficially stand out. That's the phrase. Superficially standing out versus actually having freedom from the system. And it's a lifelong struggle.

I think most of us acknowledge that caring too much about what other people think about us and letting that dictate our lives or fearing the consequences of peering a certain way to certain people is harmful for our mental health. It doesn't feel good when you're constantly worrying about these things or you're anxious about these things especially because how people perceive us is out of our control. You can't control how the world is going to perceive you.

### The Craving for External Validation

And so at some level, we all kind of understand that there's a there should be a limit that we should limit our craving for this external validation. But I think what most of us fail to acknowledge is just how deep rooted in the subconscious, this craving is.

I also want to make another point here, which is that despite what it seems like it's not, it's not really a force exerted on us by other people or the environment that we're in. It's a force that we, it's a tension that we exert on ourselves because of our craving for wanting to appear a certain way to others. It's in us, right? And I think taking responsibility for that craving is really helpful because it's only when you're doing something that leads to your suffering, can you stop doing that?

Like if the suffering was inflicted on us by other people, then, well, you can't control everyone on the planet and therefore you can never be happy, you can never be free. But I think the reality is that it's inside of us, we create this and it's our own craving that it's our own craving for this external validation that binds us, causes tension, and it makes us less free.

### The Impact of Social Platforms

And I think the internet and these platforms of expression that we have today might actually make this worse, might actually make this underlying craving for external validation worse because, I mean, that's what these social platforms optimize for, they optimize for they optimize for the craving for external validation. You might make your first few posts, not really caring how people are going to perceive it, but once they start getting some likes, and once people start sharing your content, leaving comments, talking about it, well, now you're slowly falling into the, I mean, when I say you, all of us would do this, we would slowly and oftentimes subconsciously fall into this tension in which we have less freedom, because our actions now are accompanied by more thinking and fear of upsetting our audience.

### Catering to the Algorithm vs. Artistry

In an interview that he had with Colin and Samir, Hassan Minhaj had this segment in which he talked about the algorithm versus artistry. He basically says, it's very easy to fall into the trap of catering to the algorithm. You see what's getting rewarded on a social platform, and you start to mimic that. You start to do things similar to that because you know it's more likely to catch on because that's the trend right now.

And it's very easy to fall into that thinking of doing something because of the trend. And we see this in every field. It's not just like content creation and whatever, but like, you know, I'm part of the startup world, or I'm part of tech and startups. We see this all the time. Whenever there's a hype wave, it just happens to be, it just feels like everyone's working on that thing. And everyone's trying and experimenting, trying to build some product in that thing.

### The Challenge of Balancing Algorithm and Artistry

Now the problem with this is that, I mean, look, there's actually no problem here. I mean, people are making their livings, whatever. This is a great way to do it. If you study the algorithm and you cater to it, you're far more likely to, you might be more likely to get some traction on your work, whether that means revenue or likes or both or whatever. But then when we look back in history, at the works of art, or the creations that have stood the test of time, there's something free in the way, it just feels like those creations came from a mind that was a little bit more free from the pulls of the immediate. External validation, or the immediate algorithm. would be valued by the algorithm, society, market, whatever you want to call it.

### Building Mental Fortitude

And understanding how to build that muscle to do that, I think is a very, it's an exciting question for me personally, because I think that correlates with also gaining freedom. A little bit, because you have to be at least in some sense, you have to be able to curb your craving for external validation in the short term, in order to be able to execute on something that doesn't have that safety. of mimicking something that's already out there. And I think that takes a certain amount of mental fortitude to be able to do. And I also believe that that kind of mental strength translates to other endeavors in our lives and perhaps even to having the strength to understand ourselves better and accept ourselves and be more at peace with ourselves.

### The Future of Creativity

And so I also feel like, as the world becomes more creative, or as the bar for creativity rises in the world, because technology will be increasingly doing less creative work for us. Many of us will have to think about this tension between the algorithm and the artistry, or this tension between, or relaxing or breaking free from the tension that comes from this craving for external validation, because when that's taken to the extreme, you actually don't create things that people want, because I think people see through mimicry, when it's done in a very crude or exacting way. And that's also the nature of the human mind, we always like something that's fresh. We crave freshness.

### The Balance between Algorithm and Artistry

For an entire week, every creator on the world created a video or song or movie that resembled the style of that trend, then very soon, we're going to have a need for something fresh. And I think it's that fundamental desire for something new and fresh that, well, it keeps humanity fresh in a way, because it's what enables and gives life an opportunity for new products, new art, new things. Because we always want things that are better, we always want things that are fresh, different.

The craving for new and better things pushes our species to create. It's what rewards those that 

And so in a way, that's such a, it's a positive force that leads to more creation. But at the same time, that means that anyone in a creative domain will have to understand this inner balance or trade off between catering to the algorithm versus taking a riskier path. Catering to their artistry. It's a tough skill.

### Building Mental Fortitude for Artistic Pursuits

So how do you start? How would you break free? And maybe it's also less about breaking free and more about delaying gratification. Some of the greatest creators in history had massive egos. So maybe it wasn't that they didn't want or they didn't crave external validation as much as the next person, but maybe it was more that they had the muscle that could delay when they got that gratification, external gratification.

So what are some things that could help? Well, I think first of all, it's having this as a framework, a conscious framework. Being informed about this, because whether you acknowledge that this tension exists or not, it exists, and therefore acknowledging it, and at least consciously thinking about it, is a necessary first step to getting good at balancing this. Or to getting good at delaying gratification. So getting it to the conscious level, I think is one very important thing.

### Learning from the Lives of Great Creators

Number two, studying the lives of people that created great works that you appreciate, and seeing just how uncertain those outcomes were when they first started working on them. And this could be, you know, someone who built a great product or company that you admire. It could be someone that made an incredible movie that created a new genre, defined a new style that you love.

And I think in all of these cases, or at least in the ones that I've studied, it was quite uncertain early on whether they'd succeed at all. Or maybe not that they would succeed, because you could kind of see potential for success with the fire that a person has and how hard they work and things like that. But I think it was quite uncertain to see whether, it was quite uncertain whether that project that they were working on would ever pan out. At least.

### Pushing Through Fears and Uncertainties

And I think trying to put yourself in their shoes, and into their world, and trying to feel what they might have felt when taking those decisions to do something that was quite unpopular at the time. And basically trying to live their experiences could be a useful tool. It has been for me because it just reminds me, not just at a conscious level, but if I'm feeling, if I'm trying to feel what they're feeling and the fears that they might have felt before they launched this great work or great piece of art. It helps remind me both at the conscious level and hopefully at the subconscious level that these fears, these uncertainties are part of the path. And if you're trying to do great work, there's just no way, there's no way to avoid them.

You either muster up the courage to push through them and create, or you succumb to these forces, these inner forces, these inner demons, and you take a path of less resistance. And I want to be clear, like in some cases, succumbing to them and taking an easier path might be what you have to do. It's like trying to lift weights that you're just not strong enough to lift yet. There's no shame in putting that aside and saying, I'm going to start smaller and work my way up to that in a healthy way. There's nothing wrong with that. And I think that's actually a very wise and smart thing to do, because otherwise you break yourself.

### Balancing Algorithm and Artistry in the Creative Process

But, yeah, I think the people that are going to be able to figure out this balance and the people that are going to be able to develop the mental strength to not be swayed as much by short term trends and can focus on doing work they find meaningful, regardless of its likelihood of being accepted. People can figure that out, I think, will be rewarded more as the entire world is forced to become more creative, because with an abundance of content out there, with an abundance of creation out there, and the easier it is to create, the more we'll start to value real art.

And the other side to this is, I think, as the world becomes more creative and the bar for creativity rises, and our tools become more powerful, our tools to create, the technologies that we use become more powerful, people and companies and institutions that are stuck catering to the algorithm for too long will run the risk of being invalidated quickly. By someone else or another company, or another institution that can give people a fresher, more original value.

### The Pursuit of Inner Freedom

Why am I so interested in this topic? I think I'm interested in it because, I mean, first of all, it's very relevant, given the way the world is shaping up, with everyone creating, having better tools to create. More of us will have to face this inner struggle, and more of us will have to face this challenge of building the mental fortitude to stick to what we believe in, rather than catering to the short term trends in the world. So I think it's relevant in that sense, but also because I think it's worth trying to, it just feels so important to me to try to understand the various ways in which we cause tension in ourselves, and learn how to drop that tension, so that we can be more free from our own cravings.

And this craving for external validation, I think, is one of the deepest, deepest cravings. And so that's why it's so interesting to me to try to explore the nature of this craving, and try to be inspired by people that I think have learned to develop some mastery over this craving. And I think it's also very interesting to me to try to understand what we can do to minimize the impact of this craving on our lives, both to do better work that we'll be proud of, and to gain a little bit more inner peace. And I think both of those actually go hand in hand. Or they can go hand in hand. Not that they always have to.

### Striking a Balance between Algorithm and Artistry

So if I were to take this from the top, how would I summarize the flow of what I just thought through? As the world becomes more creative, and as more of us create, we will have to come face to face with one of the most fundamental challenges for any creator, which is finding the balance between the algorithm and artistry. Which is resisting the craving for short-term external validation, so that we can do great work that we're proud of. So that we can hopefully also master this craving of inner external validation, and maybe build a little bit more peace in our minds. Thank you very much.
