**What's that body of knowledge, and way to communicate that knowledge, that will unlock the human potential?**

**Done**:
1. Be attached to outcomes, not the means.
2. Most useful knowledge is hidden.

**Active** (the next one to publish):
- AI that protects me from myself.

**Upcoming**

**Ideas**:
- Why college is outdated.
- The skills that matter. (This might take some more time to flesh out).
- AI that protects me from myself.
- Proof of competence.
- Creativity is eating the world.
- On communicating well (an expansion piece - from the seed in "Skills that matter"). - you can't build a communication copilot if you can't explain what it means to communicate well.
- Some thoughts on software engineer job hunting.
- Catering to the algorithm vs. artistry. (This could just be a reference to Hassan's segment).
- Evolution of software engineering / age of the generalist.
- AI that embodies your taste.
- Some ideas on an AI OS. - What problems could this solve and how? (This will actually take a month to design and write about, but it would be exciting since it's tackling the most fundamental).

Breaking down the "Why college is outdated angle":
- Why college is outdated (this is actually the right essay, you just have to write it very differently, and more tightly scoped).
- Being able to invest in individuals. (find a better title, but basically, need to explore this idea in a succinct way).
- Creativity is eating the world (a quick observation on how the world is changing )
- Evolution of knowledge work (or software engineering).
- Why hiring is opaque.

After all of these are published, I'm going to spend a week contemplating the next project, and then I'm going to follow [[How to go about building the next project]] to bring it to life the right way. Absolutely.
