Most useful knowledge is hidden in the minds of masters. Having the ability to extract hidden knowledge improves your rate of learning for any skill.

Masters are less likely to share their knowledge, and even when they do, they're less likely to spend the time on marketing to make their knowledge popular.

Distilling and marketing their knowledge such that it reaches a wide audience takes a great deal of effort and doesn't directly benefit their work. And so, most people that are great at something often choose to express themselves through their craft rather than share their knowledge widely.

Masters also tend to overestimate the average competence in their domain. They don’t find it worthwhile to share knowledge because they think it's obvious. “There’s no way someone wouldn’t know that!”.

Their humility is partly why they're great: you don’t learn voraciously if you think you’re already great. But, this means they see less value in sharing their knowledge.

As a result, the top search results for how to learn something are often not the best, because those most qualified to share their knowledge are the least likely to do so.

For example, most useful knowledge on how to build products is hidden in the minds of great builders, and in the internal conversations of great teams. [x].

Without the ability to extract hidden knowledge, you won't be consuming the best knowledge to learn something. And likely, you'll pick up habits and views that are harmful.
### Extracting hidden knowledge

To be able extract hidden knowledge, you need to be able to identify masters, and approach them the right way.

Determining whether someone is a master is tough, especially when you’re a beginner, because you can’t tell the difference between self-hype and true skill.

The most effective approach I’ve found to identify masters is to work backwards by first identifying good work (great products, music, films, essays, etc.), and then finding the people that made them.

You can tell if a piece of work is good based on how much you value it.

When you find good work, stalk the people behind that project and add them to a list. [x]

Then, grow that list by exploring the people they follow on social platforms. Talent begets talent: their network is also competent.

You'll be surprised by how most on this list are significantly less popular than you'd expect. [x]

Follow them on socials. The higher quality your feed, the faster you learn.

- Popularity lags far behind competence. Another reason why many masters are hidden: the world hasn't gotten around to recognizing their talent.
- Which is also why it's important to join great teams: you get access to a treasure trove of hidden knowledge.


3. **What is knowledge?**
	1. Theory, principles, rules. - Possible to distill, but still requires a great deal of effort in order to do so. (Tough, but do-able)
	2. Intuition, good judgement that is learned by doing. - very difficult to transfer without personalized feedback. (I'm not sure this is even possible without personalized feedback).
		1. Example: scenario in which someone does the work to create, and gets feedback from a master - the "diff" in intuitions about the approach is where the learning happens.
		2. Which is why traditionally, for creative skills especially, the apprentice model was popular since that's the only reliable way to enable this transfer of intuition between individuals.
		3. This intuition is the differentiating factor in knowing the rules of the game vs. playing it well. Between understanding syntax of programming and being able to build software that's used. Between understanding design principles vs. designing valuable solutions to problems.
		4. This intuition is tough to even explain. And explanations can also be incorrect - even when they come from the person who had the right intuition about something. This is why when you ask some master why they made a decision, it can take time for them to process their own memory to be able to answer. I think this is partly because they're trying to come up with an explanation after the fact, to explain their intuition, but that explanation might not actually be the right one, just the one that supports the intuition. And sometimes they're honest in their lack of understanding: "It just felt wrong, so I changed it to this".
4. **Why most useful knowledge hidden**
	1. It takes a lot of effort to share useful theory about a skill. And so often you'll find masters of a skill choosing to express themselves through their work as opposed to spending the great effort to distill their knowledge to the world.
	2. And it's next to impossible to share the intuition in a scalable way (so far), and so this is even more time consuming, and difficult to extract.
		1. Example: The hidden knowledge in designing and building an iPhone vs. what we know about it from the outside.
		2. This sort of knowledge is usually shared with others through personalized feedback.
	3. Getting distribution for your content is a different skill and effort than being competent at the skill. Therefore, the most popular content to consume to learn a skill isn't usually the best.
		1. There are plenty of incredibly useful essays, notes, videos on skills by extremely competent people that don't have much traction because the creators didn't spend the effort to get the distribution. Not even because they can't, they likely know how, but playing that distribution game is different from focusing on their work, and so they won't do it.
		2. They're deep in the weeds of their craft, and excelling at that requires that obsession that prevents them from spending much time on getting distribution for their knowledge which doesn't directly, immediately benefit their work.
	4. Which is why in addition to hidden knowledge, most competent people are also hidden: they may have a few hundreds, or thousands of followers on platforms. They're incredibly valued by their teams, but their value isn't apparent to the world at large.
		1. So many great engineers, designers, builders, marketers, etc. who are tough to track down.
	5. As people become better at a skill, their perception of the competence of the average talent is also greater. Because they see the gap as smaller than it is, they feel less of a need to share their knowledge ("Oh, that seems obvious, most people already know that").
5. **Some thoughts on how to extract hidden knowledge**.
	- Identifying who's actually competent. And biasing towards those that aren't that popular (so that they're more likely to have the time to engage with you).
	- Approaching them the right way.
		- And sort of debunk the "give them some value before you ask" advice that I subscribed to in the past, that I've changed my stance on.

Theory of knowledge:

I view knowledge as two types: the theory underlying the skill, and and the intuition to be able to apply the theory to actually be good at the skill.

It's the difference between knowing a programming language vs. knowing how to build useful, valuable software. 
Knowing design principles vs. being able to design good solutions to problems.
Knowing musical notation vs. being able to create music that people like.

Notes:
- I think people generally undervalue this component of knowledge and partly because masters make it look so easy. The fact that they make it look so easy, is actually a quality of mastering that skill which takes tremendous effort to get to.
