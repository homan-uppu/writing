(OK, the following is a separate essay altogether. It's a long piece.)

What is the ideal system to train a mind that can thrive in a world with a high bar for creativity?

1. **Learn by doing.** (with some theory)
2. **Graded by the market** i.e. make something people want, not proxies.
3. Curated consumption from a master.
4. Personalized feedback from a master.
5. Community.
6. Training for **mental health** / intangibles.

There will be exceptions here:
- Teachers that aren't masters by my definition, but still have mastery because of their passion: they love the skill and they love teaching. They really want to enable kids to learn, have low ego, and therefore they actually end up being great at helping.
