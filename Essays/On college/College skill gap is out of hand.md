The average college education around the world is crap. Most colleges don't train students to thrive in today's world, and are increasingly becoming a bad investment for most people [1].

Even for the colleges that seem to produce great talent, it isn't clear how much they actually contributed to the talent, and how much was a consequence of grouping together highly ambitious students through an artificially scarce admissions process.

Over the past few years I've worked with students from second tier colleges in the US and India and consistently found outdated curriculums, ineffective teaching methods, and incompetent teachers.

Students are training their minds for a world that no longer exists.

There are droves of "software engineers" that are coming out of many colleges around the world that simply don't know how to build software. I doubt any can be employed as engineers. And even if they manage to get an engineer job it's likely at low pay, poor working conditions, with no job security at companies with outdated business models (the software consulting industry).

I suspect the students that end up becoming competent often have to hone their skills outside of class through learning online, building their own projects. That was my experience in college, and I went to a top 10 CS program.

I think the new grad job employment numbers masks the real growing problem. I suspect many new grads end up taking up work in an unrelated field, and many probably work in jobs that don't even require a college degree. 

The world is changing exponentially. New technologies are adopted faster than ever, potentially invalidating ways of working at such a rate that we previously didn't have to worry about.

The college education system is far too rigid to keep up with these changes because of an underlying incentive problem. It wasn't designed to be able to keep up with a changing world.

A surprising thing I've noticed is that this situation isn't that alarming to most people I know. I think this is for a few reasons.

1. When you have a great education at a top school, you tend to believe the quality of the average education is far higher than what it actually is. Unless you regularly interact with students that go to the average college, you have no idea how terrible it is.
2. Lives are tough. When you're busting ass to rise in your company, etc. it's difficult to look back and thoroughly analyze the education you've had to gauge how much it actually helped you learn the skills you need.

Addressing problem deniers:
- "But everything you need to learn is online". This is technically true, but fails to acknowledge just how difficult it is to learn online without any kind of structure, mentorship and peer network, and security.
### Correlation, not causation

For the average college, tuition comprises the majority of their revenue (whether directly from students, or provided by the state).

Colleges sell training that will make you employable in exchange for money and time. A college's primary marketing metric is employment rate (for those that graduate), and median salary.

They will market the crap out of this. "Average graduate salary is $k". This sort of pitch makes it easy for prospective student to do the math to evaluate the value of investing in this education.

But this metric hides the truth.

Correlation not causation. Just because a person landed a job after college, doesn't mean the college program is what enabled them to do so. They could be getting jobs despite their college education, yet the college takes the entire credit for it.

Every graduate, unless rich, is forced to get a job in order to survive. No matter how much, or little, support their college provides, if there's a way to get a job, they will find a way to get it through various efforts. The student's back is agains the wall, a do or die situation, and they'll fight to land jobs. And when they get the job, largely through their own efforts, their college takes the credit.

In addition to this, companies often take the burden of training and education while paying the employee. They do this because they simply can't find enough competent people to hire. And so they're forced to hire untrained new grads and train them.

Guess who benefits from this? Colleges. Once again benefitting from something entirely out of their control.

The reality could be that most of the value of college can be gained by simply being around ambitious, driven, young people. But you'd never be able to tell with the marketing and numbers that you see.

And so there's no forcing function that makes colleges more effective at training students to thrive. Whether they do an excellent job or not, there will be another batch of students waiting at the entrance gate to pay ridiculous fees only to realize that it's on them to figure everything out. The "employment" numbers masked the reality.

Organizations, like humans, adapt quickly to their environments when death is the consequence of not doing so. If improving education is a "nice thing to do for students" vs. "if we don't do this, we'll have to shut down", then colleges simply won't change quickly enough to be relevant for the exponentially changing world we live in.

Public institutions have an even weaker forcing function to be better since they have tax payer money pumped in regardless of education outcomes. Why would a college change how it operates when they have absolutely no fear of immediate failure.

Sure, if a public college fails to produce results for a decade then I can see them facing great pressure. But even in that case, they'll likely get more money, instead of being shut down. Talk about warped incentives.

But that consequence is so far out that it doesn't impact administrators decision making today. Each of us has an incredible ability to ignore long-term consequences for our present actions, organizations just amplify this innate human weakness.

We need more **skin in the game** in higher education.
### Case studies

My cousin graduated with a computer science degree from a second tier US college in 2019. He was far from being able to pass a technical interview at most companies, and his lack of a brand name education made it nearly impossible to hear back from companies, let alone get an interview. He spent almost a year simultaneously practicing interview problems, building projects and his pitch, and ruthlessly executing a cold emailing strategy + getting introductions through friends that finally landed him a handful of interviews, out of which he received 2 offers.

My family friend who's currently in his 2nd year of college in Hyderabad, in quite a reputed college (not an IIT, but a popular private university in Hyderabad) is learning some arcane Java. They memorize definitions of programming concepts and regurgitate it during exams. He hasn't learned anything worthwhile in college from what I can tell, except for the natural social maturation that comes at that age from engaging with many peers.
### Colleges don't want to scale

Scarcity is their value proposition. A credential that everyone has is no signal. A zero-sum game for credential signaling, whereas the market is a positive-sum game. Fundamentally at odds with each other.
### Why attempts to displace college have failed

Over the past decade, we've seen many startups started with great ambitions: to provide better education at a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately, none of these approaches have made a significant dent to the higher education system.

For most young people, college is still the primary path. They aspire to have a college degree believing it's the key to a prosperous future. And they'll shell out as much money as required in order to do so.

Why haven't any any of these attempts fundamentally changed the higher education landscape?

**MOOCs**

From what I remember, the first promise to redefine higher education, democratizing access to high quality knowledge to anyone, anywhere - came from the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) movement.

We had Coursera, Udacity, EdX (was a non-profit version) were the 3 big platforms that launched massive online courses in collaboration with top universities. They started with plenty of free courses that anyone, anywhere, could sign up for and take.

Eventually the hype died down. These platforms realized that the majority of the revenue was in selling educational courses to company employees (enterprise subscription), rather than to redefine what higher education is for the world's youth.

"For Coursera, “enterprise” (meaning sales of subscription services to companies who offer access as a perk to employees) is already its fastest growing segment, with 70 percent year-over-year growth, compared to 29 percent for “consumer,” meaning purchases by individual students" - (https://www.edsurge.com/news/2021-12-28-a-decade-of-moocs-a-review-of-stats-and-trends-for-large-scale-online-courses-in-2021, Dec, 2021).

This made perfect business sense. And market forces pushed them away from their initial focus on democratizing access. Most young students can't afford the higher prices for courses and so the entire user demographics has shifted.

In fact, the MOOCs failure to replace colleges for most students showed us that the "lectures" in and of themselves weren't that useful. Low completion rates, meaningless credentials, and not a significantly better job prospects for having completed it.

Why weren't MOOCs able to capture the opportunity to serve hundreds of millions of young college goers as a better, more affordable alternative to college?

In a way, the failure of MOOCs to shift the higher education landscape helps us understand what people actually value in colleges. 

High quality content in and of themselves wasn't that valuable if it wasn't clear how you could translate that knowledge into a job. Most people don't care about learning for learning sake. They're faced with realities that warrant a far more practical outlook on education.

The reason colleges are appealing whereas a massive online course isn't is that a college gives a false sense of security that by going through this process, you're going to get a job at the end of it. If you take away the clear outcome of getting a job, then people aren't going to stick around and learn.

The failure of MOOCs exposed how weak the college training is on its own (lectures, assignments, knowledge) to enable someone to land a great job after it.

People point to the low completion rates as a cultural problem - if people actually wanted to get better they'd finish the course right? But that misses the point entirely: if there's no tangible increase in the prospect of getting a job, then why would anyone learn a skill?

Treating education as some kind of high virtue, and that you ought to learn for the sake of learning is such a privileged attitude. Learning for the sake of learning is a privilege that very few people in the world have.

MOOCs showed that access to knowledge isn't the problem.

Therefore, the only people who do MOOCs are people that already have some security in the path they're taking. They're studying at a college / some vocational program / already work at a company, and are taking courses outside of their primary program in the hopes that they'll look better in the eyes of employers after.

**Bootcamps**

The mid 10's was the era of bootcamps. Every month or so it seemed a new bootcamp was started that promised to turn you into a rockstar software engineer in 10 weeks!

On top of the ambitious claim, they made a new sort of financing model: the "Income share agreement" (ISA) which made it so that graduates of their program pay from their salary. If they don't make above a certain amount after graduating, then they pay nothing.

Though bootcamps started with the ambition to be a better alternative to college in order to break into an industry, they've utterly failed to do so.

It turns out they can't deliver on their promise to make it worthwhile. And they can't take more time to offer the education because then the economics doesn't work out.

Eventually the value proposition of the bootcamp went from being a better alternative to college, to helping people switch careers, a completely different audience.

It turns out that teaching a skill like software engineering is actually a lot tougher than we thought.

**Alternate credentialing**

Triplebyte. This is a counter-intuitive category to include, so I'll have to explain the connection between credentialing and higher education (bec. the main outcome of a higher education is the credential).

This was the most promising attempt I saw. By owning the credentialing and having it behind an exam that is accessible by all, you'd create an incentives shift to

---

To be clear, I have nothing but deep respect for anyone that had dedicated their effort to tackling problems in this space, regardless of their outcomes. It's not easy to build systems that fundamentally change human behavior, especially when the behavior is so deeply entrenched due to various reasons. While there have been some frauds, the majority of the actors in this space were well intentioned from what I can tell.

### Features of the ideal higher ed replacement

1. Free / low cost to dabble.
2. Confidence that the learning path will lead to employment.
3. 

### Promising directions
(I plan to expand each into its own essay).

1. Economic policy
2. Being able to invest in individuals. - def need to think this through. But there is an economic incentives shift here that would be interesting to explore.
3. AI copilots.

**Why higher education is the starting point**

I believe systemic change starts at at higher education alternatives. Fix the point at which training meets the market, and the rest of the system will "snap" into optimizing for the right training.

As people realize the strength of a learning program, a market forms around training to get into the learning program. Just like how we have SAT prep centers in the US, and how we have IIT-JEE prep programs in India - which can start as early as in elementary school!
### Notes
1. Unless what you want to become absolutely requires the college path: e.g. doctor, lawyer, etc.
2. "A quarter of grads over the age of 25 make less than $35,000 a year, with many close to the poverty level." - https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-18/is-college-worth-it-most-graduates-work-in-other-fields#xj4y7vzkg
### Research TODO
1. Who uses MOOCs? Where does their revenue come from? What is the distribution between those that are students vs. those that are already employed? And explain why that distinction matters.

**Reasons**:
1. So much **legal / political** around higher education that give weird benefits for those who study at traditional higher education institutes.
	1. Student loan repayment is quite different if you're getting it for an accredited university vs. a cohort based online course that you know is excellent, but the loan terms aren't great because it's not an "accredited" program.
2. **Cultural**. If I were to gauge the role his college played in his success in landing a job, I would say 5% - and that 5% isn't because of the curriculum, but because of the social benefits: your extended family not pestering you, subconscious biases from potential employers filtering you out because of a lack of education, etc.
3. **Economical**.
