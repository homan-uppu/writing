The market is the only grader that makes sense.

How was this done historically? I.e. for apprentices in India / Japan, etc? That would be really interesting to analyze. I'm sure there's something valuable there to unpack.

This is a good point. In fact, as the world gets more creative, the less "standardized" our education system becomes. And there are absolutely no guarantees on whether someone can end up creating value.

There may not be a "creative middle class" that we hope exists.

This is an important area to explore. If this is true, then it has serious consequences on the way the entire world works. Powerful.
