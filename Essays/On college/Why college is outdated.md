## Outline
### It's not working
- Thesis.
- Raw stats on number of people not working what they studied. Student loan debts. Etc.
- Employment numbers mask the truth.
### The average is worse than you think
- 3 case studies
- Why people think that the average is better than it is (because they've experienced something way better than the average, and hence out of touch). In fact, there's like two bubbles here that interact less than you'd think. And also people are fucking busy, don't have time to think deeply about the average education in the world.
### Why
- There was a time when college made sense - in era with lower technological leverage (=> large middle class, and more "trainable work" - i.e. not necessarily that creative, and the nature of the work wouldn't change much during the course of your lifetime).
- Exponentially increasing technological leverage.
- The rising bar for creativity across domains.
- **The more creative a skill, the more it follows the power law**.
	- (Reference Andrew Chen, and Li here).
	- The entire economy will resemble the creator economy.
- **Understanding theory doesn't guarantee ability to create value**. Which is why MOOCs didn't take over education - because the access to the courses wasn't what was lacking, but an assurance that learning something would actually lead to a job.
	- Most people don't learn for the sake of learning. The entire higher education system is predicated on the desire to learn how to actually create value (and thereby earn money) - except for the highly privileged.
	- Naval's: "if you can teach it, it'll be automated".
- **Standardized education / standardized credentialing don't work for creative skills**.
	- Analyze software engineering hiring practices in this context.
	- Which is why bootcamps failed for software engineering in the same way it would fail for, say, filmmaking, or screenwriting. The variance of the output makes it too risky to invest in the education. You'll mainly get those that have already built a savings via another job, and can afford to take the hit in case this doesn't pan out.
	- Which is why credentialing (Triplebyte) failed.
### Misaligned incentives
- Scarcity is a signal.
- Transactional education business model doesn't work for creative skills. It's too expensive for the best to give personalized feedback unless they invest in the individual.
	- If you're just paying for theory, you're not going to pay much.
	- If you're paying for personalized feedback, you can't afford it.
- What would aligned incentives look like?
	- VC model for investing in creators.
	- Platform that benefits from creators.
### Yet, college is difficult to displace
- Not cultural inertia - I think we're generally quick to adopt new ways of doing things - esp in this social media driven world.
- No more "guarantees" visible in other paths means that they're risky. When every path is risky, we choose the most familiar of them all and hope for the best - a flaw of the human mind in a sense.
### Promising directions

### Concluding thoughts

The scale of the problem: Raw stats on the number of 18 year olds in the world. -> drive home just how fucking important it is for us to figure this out. It's time.
