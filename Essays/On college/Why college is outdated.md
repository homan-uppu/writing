## Outline
### It's not working
- Thesis.
- Raw stats on number of people not working what they studied. Student loan debts. Etc.
- Employment numbers mask the truth.
### The average is worse than you think
- 3 case studies
- Why people think that the average is better than it is (because they've experienced something way better than the average, and hence out of touch). In fact, there's like two bubbles here that interact less than you'd think. And also people are fucking busy, don't have time to think deeply about the average education in the world.
### Why
- There was a time when college made sense - in era with lower technological leverage (=> large middle class, and more "trainable work" - i.e. not necessarily that creative, and the nature of the work wouldn't change much during the course of your lifetime).
- Exponentially increasing technological leverage.
- The rising bar for creativity across domains.
- **The more creative a skill, the more it follows the power law**.
	- (Reference Andrew Chen, and Li here).
	- The entire economy will resemble the creator economy.
- **Understanding theory doesn't guarantee ability to create value**. Which is why MOOCs didn't take over education - because the access to the courses wasn't what was lacking, but an assurance that learning something would actually lead to a job.
	- Most people don't learn for the sake of learning. The entire higher education system is predicated on the desire to learn how to actually create value (and thereby earn money) - except for the highly privileged.
	- Naval's: "if you can teach it, it'll be automated".
- **Standardized education / standardized credentialing don't work for creative skills**.
	- Analyze software engineering hiring practices in this context.
	- Which is why bootcamps failed for software engineering in the same way it would fail for, say, filmmaking, or screenwriting. The variance of the output makes it too risky to invest in the education. You'll mainly get those that have already built a savings via another job, and can afford to take the hit in case this doesn't pan out.
	- Which is why credentialing (Triplebyte) failed.
### Misaligned incentives
- Scarcity is a signal.
- Transactional education business model doesn't work for creative skills. It's too expensive for the best to give personalized feedback unless they invest in the individual.
	- If you're just paying for theory, you're not going to pay much.
	- If you're paying for personalized feedback, you can't afford it.
- What would aligned incentives look like?
	- VC model for investing in creators.
	- Platform that benefits from creators.
### Yet, college is difficult to displace
e
- No more "guarantees" visible in other paths means that they're risky. When every path is risky, we choose the most familiar of them all and hope for the best - a flaw of the human mind in a sense.
### Promising directions

### Concluding thoughts

The scale of the problem: Raw stats on the number of 18 year olds in the world. -> drive home just how fucking important it is for us to figure this out. It's time.
### Notes
- I respect entrepreneurs -> the Taleb line.
- Creativity sounds fun and dandy, but it's actually a lot of suffering, especially if you can't make something people want (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTJFAWFKijQ). Wake up call.

## Essay
### It's not working

Most college education around the world is useless. Most colleges don't train students to thrive in today's world, and a college education is increasingly a bad financial investment.

Colleges market “employment rates” - percentage of their graduates that landed jobs after graduating. But these rates mask the truth: that more than 40% of new grads (in just the US) are underemployed - working jobs that don't require a degree.

I suspect this is even worse in emerging economies ([https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/fresher/worthless-degrees-are-creating-an-unemployable-generation-in-india/articleshow/99570996.cms?from=mdr](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/fresher/worthless-degrees-are-creating-an-unemployable-generation-in-india/articleshow/99570996.cms?from=mdr)).

Even for the colleges that seem to produce great talent, it isn't clear how much they actually contributed to the talent, and how much the talent is a consequence of grouping together highly ambitious students through an artificially scarce admissions process.

Just because a person landed a job after college, doesn't mean the college program is what enabled them to do so. They could be getting jobs despite their college education, yet the college takes the entire credit for it.

Most graduates need to get a job in order to survive. No matter how much, or little, support their college provides, if there's a way to get a job, they will find a way to get it through various efforts. The student's back is against the wall, a do or die situation, and they'll fight to land jobs. And when they get the job, largely through their own efforts, their college takes the credit.

In addition to this, companies often take the burden of training and education while paying the employee. They do this because they simply can't find enough competent people to hire. And so they're forced to hire untrained new grads and train them.

And so it's difficult to gain any insights on how effective a college education is from the college employment pitch.

### Case studies

My cousin graduated with a computer science degree from a second tier US college in 2019. He was far from being able to pass a technical interview at most companies, and his lack of a brand name education made it nearly impossible to hear back from companies, let alone get an interview. He spent almost a year simultaneously practicing interview problems, building projects and his pitch, and ruthlessly executing a cold emailing strategy + getting introductions through friends that finally landed him a handful of interviews, out of which he received 2 offers.

My family friend who's currently in his 2nd year of college in Hyderabad, in quite a reputed college (not an IIT, but a popular private university in Hyderabad) is learning some arcane Java. They memorize definitions of programming concepts and regurgitate it during exams. He hasn't learned anything worthwhile in college from what I can tell, except for the natural social maturation that comes at that age from engaging with many peers.

### Why

As technology has become more powerful, it's reduced the effort to turn ideas into reality. This technological “leverage” raises the bar for creativity that's required to be useful in this world - especially in knowledge work (since technology has evolved far more rapidly in the digital realm than in the real world due to faster iteration cycles, faster adoption, lower cost to build, and far less regulation).

The nature of a creative skill is that there isn't a linear relationship between inputs and outputs. You can't predict that spending 1000 hours making a movie will outperform one that only took 100 hours. Or that a product with months of engineering will do better than one that took a weekend to build.

Standardized education worked for an era when the required creativity to create value in this world was far lower. You could go to a college, learn the tools of a trade, and could be employed your entire life without having to radically change the way you work.

In a low creativity, standardized world, the middle class grew. With little risk and an average intelligence / creativity, you could pursue an education that would give you the skills to almost guarantee employment [1].

Creative skills follow a power law distribution: few drastically outperform the rest.

This power law plays out in all creative domains:

[https://andrewchen.com/creator-economy-20/](https://andrewchen.com/creator-economy-20/).

Most creators on platforms don't make any money. Most revenue goes to the top creators.

A "creator middle class” ([https://hbr.org/2020/12/the-creator-economy-needs-a-middle-class](https://hbr.org/2020/12/the-creator-economy-needs-a-middle-class)) is difficult to difficult to find in the world. And it's not clear if it will ever come.

As we innovate on technology and the bar for creativity rises, more domains, and eventually the entire economy, will resemble the power law distribution of the creator economy: greater inequality, without a "middle class" that we had in previous generations.

Coming back to education: standardized education doesn't work for creative skills because you can't say with confidence whether someone with an education in that creative skill can actually make a living doing it after graduating.

Therefore, in creative domains, the transactional educational business model in which we pay an upfront “tuition” in exchange for an education that guarantees that we'll be able to build a career using that education doesn't work.

### Knowing syntax vs. having true skill




### A look at software engineering education

I think software engineering is a great field to look at to understand how this shift towards creativity impacts education and hiring in a domain. it has gone through this shift relatively recently: as recently as 5 - 10 years ago, it used to be the kind of skill that you could do in a non-creative way and still create value in this world. Rapidly evolving technological leverage in software engineering turned it into a skill with a high bar for creativity. This shift happened quite quickly, and systems built with an incorrect assumption for the level of skill required for software engineering are struggling.

The mid 2010's was the era of the "bootcamp". These startups claimed to be able to generate competent software engineers in 

### The squeeze

If college is useless, then why is unemployment so low?

- Hidden unemployment.
- The economize squeeze
- The world is a positive sum game, so it doesn't have to be like this. In the extreme, everyone can be creative, and competent to create demand where there is none. The squeeze is the consequence of not having the right training to enable people to thrive in our world.

Reality is bleaker than the numbers suggest. You can relatively quickly uncover the reality. Talk to 100 new grads from non elite institutions around the world and talk to them about how their job hunt is coming along.

It's brutal. These new grads were taught syntax, and thrown into a world that requires creativity, ingenuity in addition to the syntax.


### Mis-aligned incentives

There's also no forcing function that makes colleges more effective at training students to thrive. Whether they do an excellent job or not, there will be another batch of students waiting at the entrance gate to pay ridiculous fees only to realize that it's on them to figure everything out.
### Yet, college is difficult to displace
- I don't think cultural, social reasons are the main causes for this. It's that there isn't a 

### Promising directions
- Learning ecosystems driven by AI with a drastically different set of incentives that benefits learners.
- 
- Economic unlocking of capital to spend on alternate education routes. One sized fits all doesn't work for creative skills.
