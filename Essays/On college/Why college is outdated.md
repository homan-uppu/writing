(And some thoughts on what's next)
### It's not working

Most college education around the world is useless. Colleges don't train students to thrive in today's world, and a college education is increasingly a poor financial investment.

More than 40% of new grads (in just the US) are underemployed - working jobs that don't require a degree. This is even worse in emerging economies ([https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/fresher/worthless-degrees-are-creating-an-unemployable-generation-in-india/articleshow/99570996.cms?from=mdr](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/fresher/worthless-degrees-are-creating-an-unemployable-generation-in-india/articleshow/99570996.cms?from=mdr)).

And so it's difficult to gain any insights on how effective a college education is from the college employment pitch.

Unemployment rates hide the reality.

- Hidden unemployment.
- **The economize squeeze**. (This is important to think through because you need to have a strong counter to someone who just responds with an unemployment rate graph for a country / the world).
- **The world is a positive sum game**, so it doesn't have to be like this. In the extreme, everyone can be creative, and competent to create demand where there is none. The squeeze is the consequence of not having the right training to enable people to thrive in our world.

Reality is bleaker than the numbers suggest. You can relatively quickly uncover the reality. Talk to 100 new grads from non elite institutions around the world and talk to them about how their job hunt is coming along.

It's brutal.

### The bar for creativity is rising

As technology has become more powerful, it's reduced the effort to turn ideas into reality. This technological “leverage” raises the bar for creativity that's required to be useful in this world - especially in knowledge work.

For creative skills, there isn't a linear relationship between inputs and outputs. You can't predict that spending 1000 hours making a movie will outperform one that only took 100 hours. Or that a product with months of engineering will get more users or revenue than one that took a weekend to build.

On the other hand, for low creativity skills, the relationship is linear. On a factory assembly line, the best assembler is at best fractionally better than the average, not orders of magnitude.

The rate at which this bar of creativity rises depends on the nature of the skill and domain. 

Generally, minimally regulated domains in the realm of pixels (digital) will become more creative far more rapidly than regulated domains, and domains in the realm of atoms (physical world).

It takes longer for technology to be built and adopted in the physical world, leading to slower change. And regulated domains lead to interesting inefficiencies that cause all sorts of weird outcomes that would take a much longer essay to walk through. For example, I don't think the value of medical and legal education will deteriorate in the way that knowledge work (software engineering, marketing, design, etc.) education has.

For knowledge work, the bar for creativity in order to be valuable is rising incredibly rapidly.

The way to train for creative skills is drastically different from non-creative ones. The underlying economics and incentives means that the college model of education no longer works in today's world with a much higher bar for creativity.

To see why, we have to study how creative domains operate and understand what happens when a skill shifts from non-creative to creative.
### Features of creative domains

**1. Creative skills follow a power law distribution**: few drastically outperform the rest.

![[Screenshot 2023-09-11 at 11.41.50 AM.png]]
[https://andrewchen.com/creator-economy-20/](https://andrewchen.com/creator-economy-20/).

Most creators don't make any money, and most of the revenue generated goes to the top creators.

A "creator middle class” ([https://hbr.org/2020/12/the-creator-economy-needs-a-middle-class](https://hbr.org/2020/12/the-creator-economy-needs-a-middle-class)) is difficult to difficult to find in the world. And it's not clear when it will arrive, if ever does.

As we innovate on technology and the bar for creativity rises, more domains, and eventually the entire economy will resemble the power law distribution of the creator economy: greater inequality, without the "middle class" (at least for a while) that we had in previous generations.

**2. Creative skills resist standardization**.

Standardization is a one size fits all approach: the same curriculum, same pace, same duration, and competence assessed through standardized tests that have clear "right" and "wrong" answers to make it easy to grade, and thereby enabling the education to scale.

But, standardized assessment outcomes don't actually correlate with competence in a creative skill. For example: an A in a music class doesn't correlate with the ability to make music that people appreciate. An A in a programming language class doesn't correlate with the ability to build software that people will use / pay for.

The only thing you can test with a standardized test is knowledge of syntax, not true competence. Only the market can gauge true competence.

Any test with a clear right and wrong answer cannot identify skill that is above the bar for creativity to be valuable in the world. AI can be trained to be better than any human at any standardized test (with clearly defined right and wrong answers). **Standardized assessments optimize for exactly for the kind of competence that is no longer useful in this world**.

This isn't to say that standardized tests are entirely useless. Even creative competence requires understanding of the syntax, the rules of the medium, to be able to express yourself in it effectively. But in and of themselves, standardized tests are useless to identify true competence in the creative skill. 

Therefore, for creative skills you can't base hiring decisions off of the outcome of a standardized assessment. 

This is why in creative domains you won't find a standard interview process to filter and assess a job candidate's competence. Hiring usually happens through referrals: someone you know connects you to the candidate, or through an intensive scouting and courting process: it can take a lot of time and effort to successfully attract talent, but the effort pays off eventually because of the power law: the best are so much better than the average that you have no choice but to spend as much time and effort required to attract them.

The world loves standardization because it's efficient and also feels fair. 

It feels meritocratic when the person who does the best on a standardized test is the one to get admitted to a great college / company / institution.

And there are strong economic incentives to standardize. For every standardized assessment, there's an education market that grows around it. Most "ed-tech" companies train people to score better on standardized evaluations that lead to admission into a great college / job.

Any standardized exam can be trained for, and the value of a training program can be easily measured by looking at the scores of the students who went through the program and took the test.

This reduces the risk for a prospective student: if you know that getting a certain score on an standardized exam is all you need to get a job you want, and a learning program has a track record of producing many people who do well on the test within a set time period of training, then you'd be willing to spend a great deal of money (and could even justify taking out loans to do so), to pay for the training. The path is clear.

Since creative skills resist standardization, outcomes don't necessarily feel fair: a student that spends 3 years regularly publishing music might never make it big while another student rises to superstardom in 6 months. And you won't find massive education companies training people to become, say, startup founders (creative) in the same way you'll find them to train people to crack college entrance exams (non-creative).

Standardization is great until it no longer correlates with the kind of creative competence that matters in the world, at which point it collapses taking the market formed around it with it.

**3. Teachers of creative skills also follow the power law**

The higher the bar for creativity in the skill, the higher the bar for the teacher.

Personalized feedback from a master is incredibly valuable since there are no fixed rules / processes to follow to achieve results. A master's personalized feedback encapsulates their years of trained intuition about the skill. It's impossible to get that kind of feedback from anyone other than a master.

**4. Transactional education model (pay to learn) doesn't work to train creative skills.**

No guarantees on learning outcomes within a set time period, and the greater importance on having a high quality teacher who is a master of the craft, means that the pay-to-learn model becomes prohibitively expensive to work, let alone scale.

Therefore, all pay-to-learn business models will be relegated to serving the privileged, or to the professional who's earning money and looking to take courses to refine a skill that's professionally relevant. Often their companies will compensate such learning.

This is why massive open online course platforms (MOOCs) failed to transform education in the way it aimed to when it started.

The average student can't justify investing in an online course if it doesn't clearly translate to greater employability. Even a "small" fee such as $20 for a course is unjustifiable when you have no idea how it'll help you land a job.

On the other hand, people will find ways to finance a massive fee for a course if they have the confidence that it will translate to employability.

As the bar for creativity rises, the connection between a course and the ability to be employable / create value by learning the skill is opaque, further increasing the perceived risk of shelling out any money for a course.

On top of this, there are no timeline guarantees in creative domains. You could spend 5 years grinding without much results, or find that you can create value in just a few months. With such unpredictability in outcomes, the average student can't fathom how to justify paying for a learning program.

The completion rates for MOOCs are low because very few will sit through an entire course not knowing how it's going to tangibly improve their chances of landing a job.

People thought that by putting a paywall in front of a course, you'd improve learning outcomes. Sure, maybe. But you ostracize yourself entirely from the billion young people that desperately need a high quality education to thrive in this world.

As the bar for creativity rises, the quality of the teacher becomes more important. Masters of creative skills are those that have clearly created value with the skill: they've made things that people want and have been rewarded by the market as a result.

Their time is incredibly valuable. They wouldn't exchange their time for money in order to teach because they simply can't be compensated enough for their time. They may teach with the intention of helping others, but a system based on individual benevolence doesn't scale. 

At best masters will create content to help others learn in a way that's infinitely scalable: by putting static content (videos, guides, books, etc.), but rarely give personalized feedback to students.

So what you end up with in pay-to-learn teaching institutions is those that teach won't be close to good enough at the skill to effectively train others in it in a way that actually produces a tangible difference in outcomes.

A key learning here is that if a "master" is charging money for their knowledge and personalized feedback, you should be cautious. Either the skill they're teaching is difficult to translate into real world value, or they're not that good.

You'll find the occasional master who's teaching because of a sense of responsibility to give back to the world. In that case you'll often find that they're not focused on the money. But they're extremely particular about who they teach because they need to make sure the student is someone who has the potential to become a master.

**5. Harder to justify hiring new grads, infinite demand for the competent**

When bar for creativity was lower, as a company, you could hire unproven junior talent and take the responsibility to train them for the job. 

From a company's perspective, as a skill becomes more creative, they can't justify this type of hiring because there's no guarantee in the outcomes.

Case study: if you could train 1000 employees out of which 500 end up being competent in 2 years, that's alright. But in creative skills, the variance in outcomes can be extremely high, making this entire proposition incredibly risky. On top of this, companies are generally bad at firing. By letting in a large number of incompetent employees, you've killed the culture of the company.
### Learnings from software engineering education & hiring

To ground the ideas above in reality, let's look at the software engineering field to study how this shift towards creativity impacts education and hiring for a skill. As recently as 5 - 10 years ago, software engineering used to be the kind of skill that you could do in a non-creative way and still be useful in the world. Rapidly evolving technological leverage in software engineering turned it into a skill that today has a high bar for creativity.

And I believe the rising creativity bar explains why we've seen many startup failures in both software engineering education and hiring. They've built their company for a world in which non-creative software engineering still had demand, and have failed as the bar for creativity in software engineering shot up.

The rising bar for creativity explains their failures.

Historically, software engineering was treated as a relatively low creativity task that translated business requirements into software products. And I actually think this is a reasonable claim for the majority of software engineering work in the past. You could definitely have superstar engineers since programming is fundamentally as creative as writing, but the majority of work that moved businesses forward were cut and dry code that someone with a reasonable understanding of programming syntax and some common sense could do.

This non-creative demand is what led to the massive scale of software engineering outsourcing to countries that had a greater quantity of engineers - like Asia, and specifically to India. For example, many people I know benefitted from this boom in Hyderabad, my hometown. It didn't matter what you majored in college, you'd do a coding bootcamp and land a job at software services consulting companies that were booming in India at the time.

Due to lower technological leverage, there was room for the software engineer that wasn't that creative. Who translated business requirements into code.

But as technological leverage increased, which it did quickly in software engineering, these software consulting services have started to face a crunch (https://www.economist.com/business/2020/07/23/indian-it-consultancies-struggle-against-technological-obsolescence). And I predict they'll have a tough time being relevant over the next decade.

*(It isn't a coincidence that the place that respected software engineering for its creativity, was the place to dominate Tech: Silicon valley. - this doesn't quite go here, need to think where to make this point).*

**Bootcamps failed to be the de-facto software engineering learning system**

The mid 2010's was the era of the "coding bootcamp". These startups claimed to be able to generate competent, hirable software engineers with a course that didn't last more than half a year. They had the ambition to redefine the standard software engineering education, claiming that colleges weren't efficient at teaching software engineering, and were far too expensive.

They were right that colleges don't teach software engineering well, and is overpriced. But they were wrong that you could train a competent software engineer in a short period of time with standardized training.

They treated software engineering as a non-creative skill that you just had to learn the syntax to be competent.

Syntax in software engineering is the specific rules of the programming language / frameworks that engineers use to build products. Saying a person can be competent at software engineering by learning the syntax and building a toy project is like saying someone can be a competent musician by learning musical notation and hacking together a beat.

Bootcamps also introduces the "Income share agreement" (ISA) model which meant that, if accepted into their program, rather than paying tuition for the education you could instead pay a percentage of your salary for some years (usually 2) after getting employed.

But all this does is shifts the risk from the candidate to the bootcamp without fixing any of the underlying issues in the inability to train a creative skill through a standardized education. You can't sustain this business model if only a small percentage of graduates are able to become competent through the program.

Bootcamps have since dropped the goal to disrupt software engineering education and have been relegated to catering to the working professional who wants to make a switch to Tech for higher pay. And even this value proposition has been tough to sustain, let alone scale.

As the bar for creativity increases in the world, I predict bootcamps will have a tough time being relevant because a standardized education process with guaranteed results doesn't exist for creative skills.

**Standardized credentialing failed to take over.**

A few years ago, a software engineering credentialing company, Triplebyte, was started with the ambition to be the default credentialing for software engineers (and eventually other roles as well). You could take their software engineering interview regardless of your background, whether you went to college or not, etc.

If you did well on their interview, you'd be guaranteed final round interviews with a set of companies that worked with Triplebyte.

For companies, the value proposition was access to a high quality pool of candidates. Triplebyte made money by charging companies that hired their candidates a percentage of the candidates salary for 2 years. This business model aligned incentives: if Triplebyte could efficiently identify great talent, companies would be happy to pay.

The greatest challenge to entering the job market as an aspiring software engineer is getting interviews. Regardless of your competence, getting your foot in the door to even interview at companies has been notoriously difficult, especially so for candidates from non-traditional backgrounds: went to non-prestigious colleges / no degree, etc.

Therefore, in theory, if you could effectively evaluate software engineering competence (affordably), then you would enable a more meritocratic system that matches talent with companies regardless of how "traditional" you looked on paper.

I was excited about this approach to fix hiring. If this kind of credentialing worked, then colleges would lose power. An effective standardized test would create a market of alternatives: coaching centers, bootcamps, etc. that would train you to ace that exam.

I'd already witnessed a similar sort of market in India around IIT-JEE prep. IIT is India's premier technical university. By succeeding on this exam, you'd get entry into a top college at an affordable rate. As you can imagine, the competition is fierce, and a massive exam preparation market exists as a result.

Unfortunately, this approach isn't aligned with the truth that software engineering is a creative skill. A standardized test only works for non-creative skills. Imagine proposing a standardized filmmaking exam to accept students into a film school. That sounds absurd because it is.

Similarly, the open secret in Tech is that the software engineer interview doesn't identify top talent. The best it does is eliminates candidates who are outright lying saying that they know how to code. So it's useful to the extent that it filters out the absolute worst candidates, but by itself it can't identify the best talent.

Eventually Triplebyte failed [x]. On Hackernews (a technology / startup community) (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35184546), the head of product at Triplebyte graciously discussed why their company didn't work out:

"...It just didn't work: senior engineers simply didn't find the things we could offer them compelling enough"

"Fundamentally, if you're a hiring market paid by companies, you're selling access to talent. And finding cost-efficient ways to get that talent is a core problem of your business. We tried a few approaches to that, but none really took off. (The most successful was our Screen tool, but **the problem with that was that companies mostly wanted to screen candidates they saw as low-value - juniors and international candidates, mostly - and were terrified of screening high-value senior candidates**. The product worked well, but didn't get the candidates that would let us stand out, basically.)". (emphasis mine).

(Their point makes complete sense given the rising bar for creativity except for one small part seniority doesn't directly correlate with competence in creative skills and so I'd remove that adjective from the explanation for why it didn't work out.)

Companies that want to get the best talent, approach hiring software engineers in the same way that a music label tries to find musicians to bring on board, or a VC firm searches for promising founders to invest in.

This is why most hiring is driven by referrals: when people at the company refer other competent people they know. Unfortunately, everyone knows this except for new grads who keep applying online to hundreds of companies without ever hearing back. And the more creative a skill becomes, the less likely you are to hear back through the traditional job application process.

Every few months a post / video goes viral talking about how software engineering hiring is broken because the interview doesn't gauge actual competence. And they're right! But what I think many fail to see is that no standardized test works. Which is why despite the regular viral complaint for over 10 years we haven't seen much success replacing a standardized test with a different one. But we have seen further deviation from the standardized assessment with more companies relying even more heavily referrals and scouting vs. processing direct applicants - because companies are forced to hire in the way that's necessary to stay competitive.

It's only when you view software engineering as a creative skill, you see the absurdity of the system: bootcamps won't work, standardized credentialing won't work, applying to companies without an internal referral won't work (unless you've proven your competence publicly by creating value in the market).

Because the bar for creativity has risen so quickly in software engineering, you'll find many absurd qualities in the system due to people operating with an outdated mental model of how creative software engineering is (examples: hierarchical organizations with clearly defined promotion tiers, valuing years of experience, believing there aren't 1000x engineers, etc.). 

And since software engineering has become more creative, new grads are finding it tough to land jobs. As I mentioned earlier, companies can no longer take the risk in training new grads.

I find some people interpreting this as a lower demand for software engineers / some kind of saturation in the market. This is incorrect. There is an infinite demand for competent, creative software engineers and a falling demand for non-creative software engineers.

The economy is a positive-sum game. There isn't some finite amount of work available for us beyond which no opportunities exist. A competent, creative engineer will be able to build products that people want and will always be in demand.

The people and companies that continue to operate with an outdated model of the nature of software engineering will become outcompeted and outdated themselves.
### Why colleges can't adapt

Economics don't work out for the exact reason they don't work for software engineering bootcamps: you can't reliably train competence for a creative skill in a fixed time, without having masters educating students.

Even if the underlying economics somehow changed, it'll be tough to change the culture and standardized system of education that colleges are built on. The modern college education has roots in the industrial era in which standardized vocational training enabled people to be trained in college and employed in the workforce mostly doing low / moderate creative work.

The entire system was designed for that low creativity world: standardized curriculums, assessments, etc. It's incredibly tough to fundamentally change the DNA of an organization, especially so when it's been around for decades.

Despite its inefficacy, going to college is still the primary, aspirational path for the billion young people around the world. What gives?

The rising bar for creativity means that there can't be a low-risk, clear path to competence that will enable you to create value in this world.

In the absence of viable alternatives, people will continue doing what they've always done with the hope that because college worked in the past to land a job, it'll continue to work today.

But a system can't be so disconnected from reality and hope to live for long. Reckoning will come sooner or later. The higher education bubble will burst.

I do still see a role for elite colleges, and I think they'll be around for a while. But they educate less than 1% of the world's youth, so even if they continue to be around, they're not going to meaningfully address the increasing education gap for a billion youth.

Elite colleges are where much of humanity's long-term scientific research is carried out. We'll continue to invest a bit of our resources into long-term research. But even from a long-term research perspective, I suspect there are better models for it. The nature of publish-or-perish research environment incentivizes incremental research over working towards massive breakthroughs.

Similarly, colleges for skills that are heavily regulated (medicine, law, certain types of engineering) will continue to have demand because regulation insulates these skills from market and technological forces, and dampens the rate at which the bar for creativity rises in those domains.

Perhaps due to the higher bar for creativity and the uncertainty that comes with that, more people will choose regulated skills that have greater certainty. It isn't easy, but at least you can predict that if you invest $X into an education and work your ass off, the results will arrive within a certain time period.
### What's next?

How do we build a better learning system that cultivates the mind that can thrive in a world with a high bar for creativity? How can we scale it?

I see three promising directions to explore. I'm going to only briefly touch on each idea in this essay, and publish a longer essay treatment for each later.

**1. Enable investing in individuals**

The first is to change the business model of teaching towards investing in individuals, rather than charging a tuition in exchange for knowledge.

We saw earlier why a pay-to-learn model can't effectively train competence for a creative skill. On the other hand, if it's possible to invest in an individual: to be able to give them money, training, personalized feedback in exchange for equity in their future outcomes, then masters have the incentive to train.

We already see this investing model dominate creative fields such as startups / filmmaking / music, etc, and it's the only model that makes sense for creative skills due to the power law nature of outcomes.

Being able to invest in an individual creates a market for their potential. It incentivizes identifying promising talent early and helping them nurture their talent.

There are people that do this today: e.g coaches that train superstar athletes when they're young, etc.

But for most creative skills today, those that identify and nurture talent aren't rewarded for their efforts. They often do it out of a passion for the skill, a sense of responsibility and desire to give back to the next generation.

I have great respect for such people, but unfortunately, benevolence doesn't scale. By rewarding training people with equity, there will be a lot more activity trying to identify promising talent and train them.

And importantly, equity is the only way to adequately compensate a master. As we saw above, a pay-to-learn model can never compensate a master of a craft enough to justify them offering personalized feedback to train a student - because their time is too valuable.

But, if they had equity in their students' outcomes, those students that win will win big (due to power law), and will more than compensate for master's time spent on all students.

The equity model also incentives a master to publish their knowledge for free, to the entire world because by sharing their knowledge with the world, they'll attract the talent that they can then filter to identify the best ones to invest in.

With this investing model, as skills become more creative, I predict we'll see many "accelerators" that operate in the way a startup accelerator does, but for all kinds of skills (e.g. engineers, designers, builders, filmmakers, etc.)

But the devil is in the details. What does it mean to "invest" in an individual? Investing in a business is clear: you invest and as the company is valued more (based on perceived ability to generate long-term revenue), the value of your equity increases.

What does that mean for an individual? Does it mean that you have the right to invest in any business they start in the future at a discounted price? How do you ground what a person is "valued" in reality: the value they create in the world? What will be the role of regulation in this? How do we deter fraudulent activity (a person saying they've created something when they didn't, in order to create hype and be invested in).

**2. AI to scale personalized feedback**

AI could scale high quality personalized feedback.

The current state of AI means that it's not possible to get it anywhere close to a master's personalized feedback, but I believe with the right training examples, likely compiled and curated by masters of the craft, it's possible to get the quality of feedback to be quite useful such that it can enable a quality of learning that most people simply don't have access to.

In the coming years, as the underlying AI becomes more powerful, these feedback systems will become more powerful.

AI can also be used by platforms to train copilots based on the data users generate on the platform such that it represents the principles that lead to quality output.

**3. Policy changes that affords more people the opportunity to learn.**

I believe we'll eventually need some form of universal basic income. When the power law dominates creative skills, there will likely be many people who despite putting in a lot of effort to learn, will simply not meet the bar for creativity to be able to create value in this world. We need some sort of safety net for those that can't reach high creative competence.

I believe with enough time and the right training most people can become creatively competent. But the challenge with learning creative skills is that the timeline is unpredictable. It's not clear how long someone will take to become competent enough to be able to create value with the skill, and therefore some financial assistance is required for an individual to afford to take the time to train themselves.

As skills become more creative, it's increasingly counterproductive to prop up failing educational institutes with taxpayer money. It would be better to put money in peoples' hands and let them choose the learning paths they want. They'd be able to buy tools that they'd need to create (computers, software, etc.), take valuable trips to meetups in other cities when needed, attend conferences and events to meet others on similar learning paths - all of which will be incredibly valuable as the world becomes more creative and the standardized education at government subsidized colleges becomes more useless.

The greatest challenge with these kinds of financial / policy changes is that it requires the government to have enough money in its coffers to afford it. We'll likely see these shifts in developed countries and the path isn't clear for when it will arrive to impoverished countries who will have a increasingly tougher time competing with countries that become creative more quickly.

We'll need global cooperation to ensure that poorer countries don't fall through the cracks - which isn't beneficial to any of us. The world is so connected today that one nation failing disastrously can impact all of us.

At the same time it's rational and human nature to protect ourselves and our loved ones first before we can think about aiding people around the world, and hence this sort of global cooperation will be quite challenging and I'm not sure when we'll get to it.
### Concluding thoughts

Some might see this essay as a bit alarmist and may feel that we have some time before we make the necessary changes to adapt to a more creative world.

The problem with that view is that it doesn't take into account exponential change. We unfortunately can't intuitively comprehend exponential change and therefore it creeps up on us more quickly than we anticipate. Our intuition is wrong when it comes to preparing for exponentially evolving phenomena.

This is why we failed to adequately prepare for COVID in time despite the math clearly showing that it was on track to becoming a pandemic.

Technology is evolving exponentially fast, and so is the rate at which the bar for creativity is rising. It's time to act to update our systems that are mis-aligned with the realities of a creative world.

I welcome your feedback, and I'd love to connect especially if you're actively working in this space.
### Footnotes

**Clarifications**:
- When I say "non-creative", I'm not at all making the claim that it's easier, or that it doesn't require skill. The only difference is the correlation b/w/ inputs and outputs, teachability, and the power law dynamic that arises as a byproduct.
- Clarify what I mean by Triplebyte failing - it's a "failure" only in the sense of being a venture backed business that set out to disrupt hiring and education for the world. It could have sustained itself as a moderate, small business, and there's nothing wrong with that, but that's not going to solve the massive education problem we have on our plates.

**This is great:**
(Basically, something along the lines of "creativity isn't necessarily fun."). It's a brutal process, especially if your livelihood depends on it.
- There is no fairness in how selection happens in creative domains.
- Scarce signals are required to stand out in creative fields. This is why I think elite college opaque admissions processes actually make sense. Stanford will be a better experience because of its opaque admissions. In an alternate world in which those that do the best in a standardized test get to the top colleges, elite institutions would likely lose their ability to produce better (on average) talent.
- Similarly, YC has an extremely opaque admissions process. You simply can't have standardized / formula based approaches to admissions / hiring in creative domains.

"- We're designed to minimize risk. Alternatives don't exist because as the bar for creativity increases, all paths are becoming risky. Therefore, when every path is risky, you're going to choose the path that "seems" the least risky: college - since it worked for a previous version of the world." - nice dialogue, not sure where to insert. Think about the most elegant way to make this point.

---
### Todo
- Coming back to education: standardized education doesn't work for creative skills because you can't say with confidence whether someone with an education in that creative skill can actually make a living doing it after graduating.
- Therefore, in creative domains, the transactional educational business model in which we pay an upfront “tuition” (and often take out a loan to do so) in exchange for an education that we hope will enable us to build a career no longer works.

- ISAs might seem different than the traditional exchange tuition for education, but it's basically the same thing: it shifts the risk from the student to the institute, but if the underlying economics doesn't work out, the institute will find it very difficult to sustain itself, let alone thrive.

- As a result, the Tech industry has found itself in an interesting situation: It says it operates a certain way (according to the state of the world with a much lower bar for creativity), while operating according to a much higher bar for creativity.

- It's sad and funny that every few months a post by a software engineer will go viral claiming that the software engineering interview is broken. They're right, it is! But I haven't heard of any good, economically feasible alternative because creative skills resist standardized evaluation. If it was a problem that could be fixed with a better standardized assessment, it would have been by now.

**Case studies of lack of competence in new grads**:
- My cousin graduated with a computer science degree from a second tier US college in 2019. He was far from being able to pass a technical interview at most companies, and his lack of a brand name education made it nearly impossible to hear back from companies, let alone get an interview. He spent almost a year simultaneously practicing interview problems, building projects and his pitch, and ruthlessly executing a cold emailing strategy + getting introductions through friends that finally landed him a handful of interviews, out of which he received 2 offers.
- My family friend who's currently in his 2nd year of college in Hyderabad, in quite a reputed college (not an IIT, but a popular private university in Hyderabad) is learning some arcane Java. They memorize definitions of programming concepts and regurgitate it during exams. He hasn't learned anything worthwhile in college from what I can tell, except for the natural social maturation that comes at that age from engaging with many peers.

More consequences of rising bar for creativity: hierarchical organization structure makes no sense, especially when you associate value with seniority. That's completely outdated.

**Thoughts on why elite institutions produce talent**:
- Even for the colleges that seem to produce great talent, it isn't clear how much they actually contributed to the talent, and how much the talent is a consequence of grouping together highly ambitious students through an artificially scarce admissions process.
- Just because a person landed a job after college, doesn't mean the college program is what enabled them to do so. They could be getting jobs despite their college education, yet the college takes the entire credit for it.
- Most graduates need to get a job in order to survive. No matter how much, or little, support their college provides, if there's a way to get a job, they will find a way to get it through various efforts. The student's back is against the wall, a do or die situation, and they'll fight to land jobs. And when they get the job, largely through their own efforts, their college takes the credit.
- In addition to this, companies often take the burden of training and education while paying the employee. They do this because they simply can't find enough competent people to hire. And so they're forced to hire untrained new grads and train them.
