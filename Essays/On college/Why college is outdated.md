(And some thoughts on what's next)
### It's not working

Most college education around the world is useless. Most colleges don't train students to thrive in today's world, and a college education is increasingly a bad financial investment.

I believe college "employment rates" (percentage of their graduates that landed jobs after graduating) mask the truth. More than 40% of new grads (in just the US) are underemployed - working jobs that don't require a degree.

I suspect this is even worse in emerging economies ([https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/fresher/worthless-degrees-are-creating-an-unemployable-generation-in-india/articleshow/99570996.cms?from=mdr](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/fresher/worthless-degrees-are-creating-an-unemployable-generation-in-india/articleshow/99570996.cms?from=mdr)).

Even for the colleges that seem to produce great talent, it isn't clear how much they actually contributed to the talent, and how much the talent is a consequence of grouping together highly ambitious students through an artificially scarce admissions process.

Just because a person landed a job after college, doesn't mean the college program is what enabled them to do so. They could be getting jobs despite their college education, yet the college takes the entire credit for it.

Most graduates need to get a job in order to survive. No matter how much, or little, support their college provides, if there's a way to get a job, they will find a way to get it through various efforts. The student's back is against the wall, a do or die situation, and they'll fight to land jobs. And when they get the job, largely through their own efforts, their college takes the credit.

In addition to this, companies often take the burden of training and education while paying the employee. They do this because they simply can't find enough competent people to hire. And so they're forced to hire untrained new grads and train them.

And so it's difficult to gain any insights on how effective a college education is from the college employment pitch.

### Unemployment rate hides the truth
If college is useless, then why is unemployment so low?

- Hidden unemployment.
- **The economize squeeze**. (This is important to think through because you need to have a strong counter to someone who just responds with an unemployment rate graph for a country / the world).
- **The world is a positive sum game**, so it doesn't have to be like this. In the extreme, everyone can be creative, and competent to create demand where there is none. The squeeze is the consequence of not having the right training to enable people to thrive in our world.

Reality is bleaker than the numbers suggest. You can relatively quickly uncover the reality. Talk to 100 new grads from non elite institutions around the world and talk to them about how their job hunt is coming along.

It's brutal. These new grads were taught syntax, and thrown into a world that requires creativity, ingenuity in addition to knowing the syntax.
### A subjective look

My cousin graduated with a computer science degree from a second tier US college in 2019. He was far from being able to pass a technical interview at most companies, and his lack of a brand name education made it nearly impossible to hear back from companies, let alone get an interview. He spent almost a year simultaneously practicing interview problems, building projects and his pitch, and ruthlessly executing a cold emailing strategy + getting introductions through friends that finally landed him a handful of interviews, out of which he received 2 offers.

My family friend who's currently in his 2nd year of college in Hyderabad, in quite a reputed college (not an IIT, but a popular private university in Hyderabad) is learning some arcane Java. They memorize definitions of programming concepts and regurgitate it during exams. He hasn't learned anything worthwhile in college from what I can tell, except for the natural social maturation that comes at that age from engaging with many peers.

This is the average outcome.
### The bar for creativity is rising

As technology has become more powerful, it's reduced the effort to turn ideas into reality. This technological “leverage” raises the bar for creativity that's required to be useful in this world - especially in knowledge work.

For creative skills, there isn't a linear relationship between inputs and outputs. You can't predict that spending 1000 hours making a movie will outperform one that only took 100 hours. Or that a product with months of engineering will get more users or revenue than one that took a weekend to build.

On the other hand, for low creativity skills, the relationship is linear. On a factory assembly line, the best assembler is at best fractionally better than the average, not orders of magnitude.

### Features of creative domains

**1. Creative skills follow a power law distribution**: few drastically outperform the rest.

![[Screenshot 2023-09-11 at 11.41.50 AM.png]]
[https://andrewchen.com/creator-economy-20/](https://andrewchen.com/creator-economy-20/).

Most creators don't make any money, and most of the revenue generated goes to the top creators.

A "creator middle class” ([https://hbr.org/2020/12/the-creator-economy-needs-a-middle-class](https://hbr.org/2020/12/the-creator-economy-needs-a-middle-class)) is difficult to difficult to find in the world. And it's not clear when it will arrive, if it ever does.

As we innovate on technology and the bar for creativity rises, more domains, and eventually the entire economy (outside of heavily regulated industries), will resemble the power law distribution of the creator economy: greater inequality, without the "middle class" (at least for a while) that we had in previous generations.

**2. Creative skills resist standardization**.

As a domain goes from non-creative to creative, learning the "syntax" of the skill is no longer enough to be competent in it. Syntax is the formal rules of the skill. For writing, this would be a knowledge of spelling, grammar and sentence structure. In software engineering this would be knowing a programming language and framework that lets you build software. In filmmaking this would be learning story structure principles, etc.

But, by nature of a creative domain, knowing how to create isn't enough to create something people want, i.e. that the market appreciates, and what determines your competence in that creative skill.

When the bar for creativity is low, you could get away with just knowing the syntax of a skill because there was a market for doing low creativity work since computers / robots / AI wasn't available yet to do that on our behalf.

This is why for creative skills, learning theory alone won't get you far. It's like trying to make great music by learning musical notation. Theory is important to give you a foundation to express yourself in that skill, but it isn't enough to make you good at it.

Syntax can be taught in a standardized, one size fits all way: learners can pick up principles via lectures and standardized tests can accurately gauge how well the students remembered the syntax.

Our entire education system was designed to train syntax, not creative skill, because historically knowing syntax was good enough to enable you to build a meaningful life, and because standardized education is the only kind that has been able to scale. Even a horrible teacher can't mess up too much if they're following a standardized teaching curriculum.

Learning a creative skill resists standardization because fundamentally, the skills you test for in a standardized way won't correlate with creative competence (WHY???).

Personalized feedback from masters becomes even more critical to learn creative skills. A teacher that isn't great themselves is less able to train a student to be great. On the other hand, for non-creative skills, you can get quite far with just a great learning guide, without personalized feedback. In the extreme example: if your job is to wipe tables for a living, you could relatively quickly learn the right technique for it to be effective.

Nobody will tell you that by going to film school you'll be a great filmmaker because we intuitively know that learning the technique alone won't make you a great artist. This will be how any skill is viewed.

Similarly, identifying talent in creative domains resists a standardized interviewing process. You can't hire the best creatives by having them pass an interview with a standard set of questions and answers that you can simply study and crack.

Imagine trying to hire a cinematographer by quizzing them on the types of lenses, and when they'd use which lens. Sure, they may need to understand the technicalities of their skill, but that alone doesn't mean they're good. A great cinematographer brings a unique style, perspective to the project. They're able to capture the director's vision and feelings in a way that adds value to the project. It's very difficult to capture that intuition through a standardized interview process with a pre-determined set of questions and appropriate answers.

This makes learning and job hunting especially challenging because the strategy to simply study to "crack an interview" doesn't work since you'll find it hard to get an interview in the first place until and unless you've already demonstrated your ability to create value with your skill.

This leads to a world in which you can simultaneously have an unmet high demand for a skill, and yet have millions of new grads unemployable for that skill because they don't meet the bar for creativity.

**3. Transactional education model (pay to learn) doesn't work for creative skills.**

Paying an up front tuition only works when you have a high probability of employment afterwards. The higher the probability, the easier it is for you to take a loan and finance your tuition. This worked great when the bar for creativity was lower - you could reliably get a good job with a college degree.

Now that outcomes are no longer guaranteed, especially on an arbitrary timeline (e.g. "4 years of college), financing an education with a loan is extremely risky.

The education financing institutions have been late to realize that the bar for creativity has gone up and the college education no longer has the returns it needs to justify giving out massive loans to every 18 year old that asks for it, and therefore we have millions of graduates crippled with student loan debt: they took out a big loan for college under the incorrect impression that a college education will guarantee a good job, only to realize that the world operates quite differently due to a significantly higher bar for creativity.

Therefore, the path to training your mind to thrive in this world is difficult and uncertain.

The rate at which this bar of creativity rises depends on the nature of the skill and domain. 

Generally, minimally regulated domains in the realm of pixels (digital) will become more creative far more rapidly than regulated domains, and domains in the realm of atoms (physical world).

It takes longer for technology to be built and adopted in the physical world, leading to slower change. And regulated domains lead to interesting inefficiencies that cause all sorts of weird outcomes that would take a much longer essay to walk through. For example, I don't think the value of medical and legal education will deteriorate in the way that knowledge work (software engineering, marketing, design, etc.) education has.

For knowledge work, the bar for creativity in order to be valuable is rising incredibly rapidly.
### Learnings from software engineering education & hiring

I think software engineering is a great field to study to understand how this shift towards creativity impacts education and hiring in a domain. As recently as 5 - 10 years ago, software engineering used to be the kind of skill that you could do in a non-creative way and still be useful in the world. Rapidly evolving technological leverage in software engineering turned it into a skill that today has a high bar for creativity.

And I believe the rising creativity bar explains why we've seen various startup failures in both software engineering education and hiring. They've built their company for a world in which non-creative software engineering still had demand, and have failed as the bar for creativity in software engineering shot up.

Their failures are proof of the rising bar for creativity.

Historically, software engineering was treated as a relatively low creativity task that translated business requirements into software products. And I actually think this is a reasonable claim for the majority of software engineering work in the past. You could definitely have superstar engineers since programming is fundamentally as creative as writing, but the majority of work that moved businesses forward were cut and dry code that someone with a reasonable understanding of programming syntax and some common sense could do.

This is what led to the massive scale of software engineering outsourcing to countries that had a greater quantity of engineers - like Asia, and specifically to India. For example, many people I know benefitted from this boom in Hyderabad, my hometown. It didn't matter what you majored in college, you'd do a coding bootcamp and land a job at software services consulting companies that were booming in India at the time.

Due to lower technological leverage, there was room for the software engineer that wasn't that creative. Who translated business requirements into code.

But as technological leverage increased, which it did quickly in software engineering, these software consulting services have faced a crunch.

(TODO: show the economics of software consulting as a space - the noose is getting tighter).

*(It isn't a coincidence that the place that respected software engineering for its creativity, was the place to dominate Tech: Silicon valley. - this doesn't quite go here, need to think where to make this point).*

**Bootcamps failed to be the de-facto software engineering learning system**

The mid 2010's was the era of the "coding bootcamp". These startups claimed to be able to generate competent, hirable software engineers with a course that didn't last more than half a year. They had the ambition to redefine the standard software engineering education, claiming that colleges weren't efficient at teaching software engineering, and were far too expensive.

They were right that colleges don't teach software engineering well, and is overpriced. But they were wrong that you could create a competent software engineer in a short period of time with standardized training.

They treated software engineering as a non-creative skill that you just had to learn the syntax to be competent.

Syntax in software engineering is the specific rules of the programming language / frameworks that engineers use to build products. Saying a person can be competent at software engineering by learning the syntax and building a toy project is like saying someone can be a competent musician by learning musical notation and hacking together a beat.

Bootcamps have since dropped the goal to disrupt software engineering education and have been relegated to catering to the working professional who wants to make a switch to Tech for higher pay. And even this value proposition has been tough to sustain, let alone scale.

As the bar for creativity increases in the world, I predict bootcamps will have a tough time being relevant because a standardized education process with guaranteed results doesn't exist for creative skills.

**Standardized credentialing failed to take over.**

A few years ago, a software engineering credentialing company, Triplebyte, was started with the ambition to be the default credentialing for software engineers (and eventually other roles as well). You could take their software engineering interview regardless of your background, whether you went to college or not, etc.

If you did well on their interview, you'd be guaranteed final round interviews with a set of companies that worked with Triplebyte.

For companies, the value proposition was access to a high quality pool of candidates. Triplebyte made money by charging companies that hired their candidates a percentage of the candidates salary for 2 years. This business model aligned incentives: if Triplebyte could efficiently identify great talent, companies would be happy to pay.

The greatest challenge to entering the job market as an aspiring software engineer is getting interviews. Regardless of your competence, getting your foot in the door to even interview at companies has been notoriously difficult, especially so for candidates from non-traditional backgrounds: went to non-prestigious colleges / no degree, etc.

Therefore, in theory, if you could effectively evaluate software engineering competence (affordably), then you would enable a more meritocratic system that matches talent with companies regardless of how "traditional" you looked on paper.

I was excited about this approach to fix hiring. If this kind of credentialing worked, then colleges would lose power. An effective standardized test would create a market of alternatives: coaching centers, bootcamps, etc. that would train you to ace that exam.

I'd already witnessed a similar sort of market in India around IIT-JEE prep. IIT is India's premier technical university. By succeeding on this exam, you'd get entry into a top college at an affordable rate. As you can imagine, the competition is fierce, and a massive exam prep market exists as a result.

Unfortunately, this approach isn't aligned with the truth that software engineering is a creative skill. A standardized test only works for non-creative skills. Imagine proposing a standardized filmmaking exam to accept students into a film school. That sounds absurd because it is.

Similarly, the open secret in Tech is that the software engineer interview doesn't identify top talent. The best it does is eliminates candidates who are outright lying saying that they know how to code. So it's useful to the extent that it filters out the worst candidates, but by itself it can't identify the best talent.

Eventually Triplebyte failed [x]. On Hackernews (a technology / startup community) (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35184546), the head of product at Triplebyte graciously discussed why their company didn't work out:

"...It just didn't work: senior engineers simply didn't find the things we could offer them compelling enough"

"Fundamentally, if you're a hiring market paid by companies, you're selling access to talent. And finding cost-efficient ways to get that talent is a core problem of your business. We tried a few approaches to that, but none really took off. (The most successful was our Screen tool, but **the problem with that was that companies mostly wanted to screen candidates they saw as low-value - juniors and international candidates, mostly - and were terrified of screening high-value senior candidates**. The product worked well, but didn't get the candidates that would let us stand out, basically.)". (emphasis mine).

Companies that want to get the best talent, approach hiring software engineers in the same way that a music label tries to find musicians to bring on board, or a VC firm searches for promising founders to invest in.

This is why most hiring is driven by referrals: when people at the company refer other competent people they know. Unfortunately, everyone knows this except for new grads who keep applying online to hundreds of companies without ever hearing back. And the more creative a skill becomes, the less likely you are to hear back through the traditional job application process.

Open application works for non-creative skills that you can assess objectively. Hiring in any creative domain is predominantly back-channel, subjective, through referrals. It resembles high touch sales.

It's only when you start to view software engineering as a creative skill, the absurdity of the system makes sense: bootcamps won't work, standardized credentialing won't work, applying to companies without a referral won't work.

The power law means that there definitely exist engineers that are 10x / 100x / 1000x / (10^n)x more productive than the average. This difference between the average and the best will only grow as technological leverage increases.

As more skills make the shift from non-creative to creative, we'll see a similar power law distribution of talent, and therefore similar hiring dynamics.
### Why colleges won't adapt

### Yet, college is tough to displace

If it can't adapt, then why is college **still** the primary path for most young people?

I used to believe this is predominantly because of how deeply rooted the notion of college is in our culture. That because a college education has been aspirational for centuries, people still want to get a degree because of the prestige associated with it.

But, historically, when systems don't work and we have significantly better alternatives, we've been relatively quick to adopt them. 

So if there really was a great college alternative that had a track record of excellent results, that was affordable, it would be massively successful.

Most students go to college because they believe that by doing well in the college education process, they'll be employable (or that they can start their own thing) and be able to build a fulfilling, meaningful career. Those that are learning for the sake of learning are a nearly invisible minority.

The challenge with a rising bar in creativity is that it inherently makes all learning paths more risky because the higher the creativity bar, the less guarantee you have that you can create value - no matter what learning path you take.

(TODO: examples of film school, or art schools showcase this risk).

As a result, outside a few domains (those that are regulated), there aren't any low-risk learning paths available.

In the absence of any perceived low risk alternative to learning, people will fall back on existing systems, believing that since they worked in the past, there's a chance it'll work now.

Unfortunately, they don't realize that the past is long gone and college no longer works today. And because the results aren't immediate, it'll take someone a few years to realize the truth, that they have to train their mind in a radically different way than they did in college, in order to thrive in this world.
### What's next?

How do we build a better learning system that scales to the hundreds of millions across the world that desperately need it? That trains people to have the necessary competence, creativity, ingenuity to thrive in this highly technologically leveraged world?

** Need to refute the counter that "what if there won't be enough jobs for this kind of training" - this counter fails because the world is a positive sum game. Reference the Naval thought experiment (which I think explains this incredibly well).

**Short / medium-term:**
- **Policy changes** to unlock capital to spend on alternate education routes. One sized fits all doesn't work for creative skills. People need to be able to choose how they spend money to learn. Instead of subsidizing state / local schools, just give people the money for them to spend on choosing their own learning path. Right now, people are actually penalized for wanting to learn in their own way - outside of the traditional college system.
	- Need to talk about how the government trying to run educational institutes doesn't work. The better approach would be to subsidize internet and perhaps a device to access the internet, and just give them money to spend on online courses, etc. to learn themselves. That's far better use of capital than to waste money on things that will no longer translate to great educational outcomes.
	- I'd also work on propaganda to increase nationalism - in order to attract the best minds of my country to come back and teach. Get the talent, give them resources, and have THEM train the next generation.
	- (Not sure if digging into this is that necessary here. I just want to emphasize the importance of this issue more than anything).
- Investing in individuals -> web3 is interesting in this regard. But tough. Due to regulations. The technology isn't the difficult part, it's the legal / regulatory challenges in letting people "invest" in individuals in the same way they invest in companies. But, this is the only model that makes sense. Hmm...
- Learning copilots. -> This is a compelling direction.

Learning ecosystems around tools -> Notion, Replit, Figma, Midjourney.

**Long-term:**
- **Global UBI**. We absolutely need some way to raise the baseline. The path to being creative isn't easy - despite all the positives we've associated with it.
### Concluding thoughts

### Notes

**Clarifications**:
- When I say "non-creative", I'm not at all making the claim that it's easier, or that it doesn't require skill. The only difference is the correlation b/w/ inputs and outputs, teachability, and the power law dynamic that arises as a byproduct.
- Clarify what I mean by Triplebyte failing - it's a "failure" only in the sense of being a venture backed business that set out to disrupt hiring and education for the world. It could have sustained itself as a moderate, small business, and there's nothing wrong with that, but that's not going to solve the massive education problem we have on our plates.

**This is great:**
(Basically, something along the lines of "creativity isn't necessarily fun."). It's a brutal process, especially if your livelihood depends on it.
- There is no fairness in how selection happens in creative domains.
- Scarce signals are required to stand out in creative fields. This is why I think elite college opaque admissions processes actually make sense. Stanford will be a better experience because of its opaque admissions. In an alternate world in which those that do the best in a standardized test get to the top colleges, elite institutions would likely lose their ability to produce better (on average) talent.
- Similarly, YC has an extremely opaque admissions process. You simply can't have standardized / formula based approaches to admissions / hiring in creative domains.

"- We're designed to minimize risk. Alternatives don't exist because as the bar for creativity increases, all paths are becoming risky. Therefore, when every path is risky, you're going to choose the path that "seems" the least risky: college - since it worked for a previous version of the world." - nice dialogue, not sure where to insert. Think about the most elegant way to make this point.

---
### Todo
- Coming back to education: standardized education doesn't work for creative skills because you can't say with confidence whether someone with an education in that creative skill can actually make a living doing it after graduating.
- Therefore, in creative domains, the transactional educational business model in which we pay an upfront “tuition” (and often take out a loan to do so) in exchange for an education that we hope will enable us to build a career no longer works.

- ISAs might seem different than the traditional exchange tuition for education, but it's basically the same thing: it shifts the risk from the student to the institute, but if the underlying economics doesn't work out, the institute will find it very difficult to sustain itself, let alone thrive.

- As a result, the Tech industry has found itself in an interesting situation: It says it operates a certain way (according to the state of the world with a much lower bar for creativity), while operating according to a much higher bar for creativity.

- It's sad and funny that every few months a post by a software engineer will go viral claiming that the software engineering interview is broken. They're right, it is! But I haven't heard of any good, economically feasible alternative because creative skills resist standardized evaluation. If it was a problem that could be fixed with a better standardized assessment, it would have been by now.
