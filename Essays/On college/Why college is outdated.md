### It's not working

Most college education around the world is useless. Most colleges don't train students to thrive in today's world, and a college education is increasingly a bad financial investment.

I believe college "employment rates" (percentage of their graduates that landed jobs after graduating) mask the truth. More than 40% of new grads (in just the US) are underemployed - working jobs that don't require a degree.

I suspect this is even worse in emerging economies ([https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/fresher/worthless-degrees-are-creating-an-unemployable-generation-in-india/articleshow/99570996.cms?from=mdr](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/fresher/worthless-degrees-are-creating-an-unemployable-generation-in-india/articleshow/99570996.cms?from=mdr)).

Even for the colleges that seem to produce great talent, it isn't clear how much they actually contributed to the talent, and how much the talent is a consequence of grouping together highly ambitious students through an artificially scarce admissions process.

Just because a person landed a job after college, doesn't mean the college program is what enabled them to do so. They could be getting jobs despite their college education, yet the college takes the entire credit for it.

Most graduates need to get a job in order to survive. No matter how much, or little, support their college provides, if there's a way to get a job, they will find a way to get it through various efforts. The student's back is against the wall, a do or die situation, and they'll fight to land jobs. And when they get the job, largely through their own efforts, their college takes the credit.

In addition to this, companies often take the burden of training and education while paying the employee. They do this because they simply can't find enough competent people to hire. And so they're forced to hire untrained new grads and train them.

And so it's difficult to gain any insights on how effective a college education is from the college employment pitch.

### Unemployment rate hides the truth
If college is useless, then why is unemployment so low?

- Hidden unemployment.
- **The economize squeeze**. (This is important to think through because you need to have a strong counter to someone who just responds with an unemployment rate graph for a country / the world).
- **The world is a positive sum game**, so it doesn't have to be like this. In the extreme, everyone can be creative, and competent to create demand where there is none. The squeeze is the consequence of not having the right training to enable people to thrive in our world.

Reality is bleaker than the numbers suggest. You can relatively quickly uncover the reality. Talk to 100 new grads from non elite institutions around the world and talk to them about how their job hunt is coming along.

It's brutal. These new grads were taught syntax, and thrown into a world that requires creativity, ingenuity in addition to knowing the syntax.
### A subjective look

My cousin graduated with a computer science degree from a second tier US college in 2019. He was far from being able to pass a technical interview at most companies, and his lack of a brand name education made it nearly impossible to hear back from companies, let alone get an interview. He spent almost a year simultaneously practicing interview problems, building projects and his pitch, and ruthlessly executing a cold emailing strategy + getting introductions through friends that finally landed him a handful of interviews, out of which he received 2 offers.

My family friend who's currently in his 2nd year of college in Hyderabad, in quite a reputed college (not an IIT, but a popular private university in Hyderabad) is learning some arcane Java. They memorize definitions of programming concepts and regurgitate it during exams. He hasn't learned anything worthwhile in college from what I can tell, except for the natural social maturation that comes at that age from engaging with many peers.

This is the average outcome.

### The bar for creativity is rising

As technology has become more powerful, it's reduced the effort to turn ideas into reality. This technological “leverage” raises the bar for creativity that's required to be useful in this world - especially in knowledge work (since technology has evolved far more rapidly in the digital realm than in the real world due to faster iteration cycles, faster adoption, lower cost to build, and far less regulation).

The nature of a creative skill is that there isn't a linear relationship between inputs and outputs. You can't predict that spending 1000 hours making a movie will outperform one that only took 100 hours. Or that a product with months of engineering will get more users or revenue than one that took a weekend to build.

On the other hand, for low creativity skills, the relationship is linear. On a factory assembly line, the best assembler is at best fractionally better than the average, not orders of magnitude.

Standardized education works when there's demand for low creativity work. You could go to a college, learn the tools of a trade, and could be employed your entire life without having to radically change the way you work.

In a low creativity, standardized world, the middle class grew. With relatively less risk and an average intelligence / creativity, you could pursue an education that would give you the skills to almost guarantee employment [1].

Creative skills follow a power law distribution: few drastically outperform the rest.

This power law plays out in all creative domains:

[https://andrewchen.com/creator-economy-20/](https://andrewchen.com/creator-economy-20/).

Most creators on platforms don't make any money. Most revenue goes to the top creators.

A "creator middle class” ([https://hbr.org/2020/12/the-creator-economy-needs-a-middle-class](https://hbr.org/2020/12/the-creator-economy-needs-a-middle-class)) is difficult to difficult to find in the world. And it's not clear when it will arrive, if ever.

As we innovate on technology and the bar for creativity rises, more domains, and eventually the entire economy, will resemble the power law distribution of the creator economy: greater inequality, without a "middle class" (at least for a while) that we had in previous generations.

### Learnings from software engineering education & hiring

I think software engineering is a great field to look at to understand how this shift towards creativity impacts education and hiring in a domain. It's gone through this shift relatively recently: as recently as 5 - 10 years ago, software engineering used to be the kind of skill that you could do in a non-creative way and still be useful. Rapidly evolving technological leverage in software engineering turned it into a skill with a high bar for creativity. This shift happened quite quickly, and systems built with an incorrect assumption for the level of creativity in software engineering are struggling.

(TODO: better justify how software engineering education and hiring generalizes to all domains that make the shift from non-creative to creative).

Historically, software engineering was treated as a relatively low creativity task that translated business requirements into software products. And I actually think this is a reasonable claim for the majority of software engineering work in the past. You could definitely have superstar engineers since programming is fundamentally as creative as writing, but the majority of work that moved businesses forward were cut and dry code that someone with a reasonable understanding of programming syntax and some common sense could do.

This is what led to the massive scale of software engineering outsourcing to countries that had a greater quantity of engineers - like Asia, and specifically to India. For example, many people I know benefitted from this boom in Hyderabad, my hometown. It didn't matter what you majored in college, you'd do a coding bootcamp and land a job at software services consulting companies that were booming in India at the time.

Due to lower technological leverage, there was room for the software engineer that wasn't that creative. Who translated business requirements into code.

But as technological leverage increased, which it did quickly in software engineering, these software consulting services have faced a crunch.

(TODO: show the economics of software consulting as a space - the noose is getting tighter).

*(It isn't a coincidence that the place that respected software engineering for its creativity, was the place to dominate Tech: Silicon valley. - this doesn't quite go here, need to think where to make this point).*

**Bootcamps**.

The mid 2010's was the era of the "bootcamp". These startups claimed to be able to generate competent, hirable software engineers with a course that didn't last more than half a year. They had the ambition to redefine the standard software engineering education, claiming that colleges weren't efficient at teaching software engineering, and were far too expensive.

They were right that colleges don't teach software engineering well, and is overpriced. But they were wrong that you could create a competent software engineer in a short period of time with standardized training.

They treated software engineering as a non-creative skill that you just had to learn the syntax to be competent.

Syntax in software engineering is the specific rules of the programming language / frameworks that engineers use to build products. Saying a person can be competent at software engineering by learning the syntax and building a toy project is like saying someone can be a competent musician by learning musical notation and hacking together a beat.

Bootcamps have since dropped the goal to disrupt software engineering education and have been relegated to catering to the working professional who wants to make a switch to Tech for higher pay. And even this value proposition has been tough to sustain, let alone scale.

As the bar for creativity increases in the world, I predict bootcamps will have a tough time being relevant because a standardized education process with guaranteed results doesn't exist for creative skills.

**Credentialing**.

A few years ago, a software engineering credentialing company, Triplebyte, was started with the ambition to be the default credentialing for software engineers (and eventually other roles as well). You could take their software engineering interview regardless of your background, whether you went to college or not, etc.

If you did well on their interview, you'd be guaranteed final round interviews with a set of companies that worked with Triplebyte.

For companies, the value proposition was access to a high quality pool of candidates. Triplebyte made money by charging companies that hired their candidates a percentage of the candidates salary for 2 years. This business model aligned incentives: if Triplebyte could efficiently identify great talent, companies would be happy to pay.

The greatest challenge to entering the job market as an aspiring software engineer is getting interviews. Regardless of your competence, getting your foot in the door to even interview at companies has been notoriously difficult, especially so for candidates from non-traditional backgrounds: went to non-prestigious colleges / no degree, etc.

Therefore, in theory, if you could effectively evaluate software engineering competence (affordably), then you would enable a more meritocratic system that matches talent with companies regardless of how "traditional" you looked on paper.

I was excited about this approach to fix hiring. If this kind of credentialing worked, then colleges would lose power. An effective standardized test would create a market of alternatives: coaching centers, bootcamps, etc. that would train you to ace that exam.

I'd already witnessed a similar sort of market in India around IIT-JEE prep. IIT is India's premier technical university. By succeeding on this exam, you'd get entry into a top college at an affordable rate. As you can imagine, the competition is fierce, and a massive exam prep market exists as a result.

Unfortunately, this approach isn't aligned with the truth that software engineering is a creative skill. A standardized test only works for non-creative skills. Imagine proposing a standardized filmmaking exam to accept students into a film school. That sounds absurd because it is.

Similarly, the open secret in Tech is that the software engineer interview doesn't identify top talent. The best it does is eliminates candidates who are outright lying saying that they know how to code. So it's useful to the extent that it filters out the worst candidates, but by itself it can't identify the best talent.

Eventually Triplebyte failed [x]. On Hackernews (a technology / startup community) (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35184546), the head of product at Triplebyte graciously discussed why their company didn't work out:

"...It just didn't work: senior engineers simply didn't find the things we could offer them compelling enough"

"Fundamentally, if you're a hiring market paid by companies, you're selling access to talent. And finding cost-efficient ways to get that talent is a core problem of your business. We tried a few approaches to that, but none really took off. (The most successful was our Screen tool, but **the problem with that was that companies mostly wanted to screen candidates they saw as low-value - juniors and international candidates, mostly - and were terrified of screening high-value senior candidates**. The product worked well, but didn't get the candidates that would let us stand out, basically.)". (emphasis mine).

Companies that want to get the best talent, approach hiring software engineers in the same way that a music label tries to find musicians to bring on board, or a VC firm searches for talented founders to invest in.

This is why most hiring is driven by referrals: when people at the company refer other competent people they know. Unfortunately, everyone knows this except for new grads who keep applying online to hundreds of companies without ever hearing back.

Open application works for non-creative skills that you can assess objectively. Hiring in any creative domain is predominantly back-channel, subjective, through referrals and high touch sales.

It's only when you start to view software engineering as a creative skill, the absurdity of the system makes sense: bootcamps won't work, standardized credentialing won't work, applying to companies without a referral won't work.

The power law means that there definitely exist engineers that are 10x / 100x / 1000x / (10^n)x more productive than the average. This difference between the average and the best will only grow as technological leverage increases.

As more skills make the shift from non-creative to creative, we'll see a similar power law distribution of talent, and therefore similar hiring dynamics.
### Why colleges will fail to train creative minds

To understand this, we need to first clarify what the ideal system would be to train a mind that can thrive in a world with a high bar for creativity.

Fortunately, we have thousands of years of history of training people in creative skills, that we can learn from.

College as we know it was designed for the industrial age: to offer a standardized education so that people can perform a standardized, non-creative job. That's what most of the economy was built on for most of human history.

1. It takes time.
2. Learn by doing.
3. High quality, personalized feedback.
4. Community

**(This section should generalize college to any kind of tuition-based education system).**

The economics simply don't support it because the incentives don't exit. These systems, even when high quality education, don't scale to the world because of the numbers.

(TODO: reference Austen Allred's point about how they can't increase the course duration because it would be too expensive).

**Elite programs will continue to exist, but tough to scale due to cost**. 99.99% of higher education will fail to train the creative minds.

- But their power will diminish. **Will be training for researchers, and regulated domains**.
- Artificial scarcity and a stupidly high bar for entrance is still valuable. But cost of education is prohibitively high. Elite institutions don't have the market pressure to perform.
- Not because of the content -> MOOCs proved this.
- Not because of "research".
- Because of the curated student body via an artificially difficult admissions process, personalized feedback (this is actually quite important).

I think the elites will continue to be valuable, but they're < 1% of the education system, so in a sense, they don't even matter in the grand scheme of things.

But they can't scale because the content isn't what's valuable. It's the scarcity, the student body, and the personalized feedback - which are incredibly difficult to scale.

The average college education sucks, and the best won't scale because they can't.

**Misaligned incentives**.
### Yet, college is tough to displace

Why is college **still** the primary path for most young people?

I used to believe this is because of how deeply rooted the notion of college is in our culture. That because a college education has been aspirational for centuries, people still want to get a degree because of the prestige associated with it.

But this is a partial, weak explanation. Historically, when systems don't work and we have significantly better alternatives, we've been relatively quick to adopt them. 

So if there really was a great college alternative that had a track record of excellent results, that was affordable, it would be massively successful.

Most students go to college because they believe that by doing well in the college education process, they'll be employable (or that they can start their own thing) and be able to build a fulfilling, meaningful career. Those that are learning for the sake of learning are a nearly invisible minority.

The challenge with a rising bar in creativity is that it inherently makes all learning paths more risky because the higher the creativity bar, the less guarantee you have that you can create value - no matter what learning path you take.

(TODO: examples of film school, or art schools showcase this risk).

As a result, outside a few domains (those that are regulated), there aren't any low-risk learning paths available.

In the absence of any perceived low risk alternative to learning, people will fall back on existing systems, believing that since they worked in the past, there's a chance it'll work now.

Unfortunately, they don't realize that the past is long gone and college no longer works today. And because the results aren't immediate, it'll take someone a few years to realize the truth, that they have to train their mind in a radically different way than they did in college, in order to thrive in this world.
### Promising directions

How do we build a better learning system that scales to the hundreds of millions across the world that desperately need it? That trains people to have the necessary competence, creativity, ingenuity to thrive in this highly technologically leveraged world?

** Need to refute the counter that "what if there won't be enough jobs for this kind of training" - this counter fails because the world is a positive sum game. Reference the Naval thought experiment (which I think explains this incredibly well).

**Short / medium-term:**
- Policy changes to unlock capital to spend on alternate education routes. One sized fits all doesn't work for creative skills. People need to be able to choose how they spend money to learn. Instead of subsidizing state / local schools, just give people the money for them to spend on choosing their own learning path. Right now, people are actually penalized for wanting to learn in their own way - outside of the traditional college system.
- Investing in individuals -> web3 is interesting in this regard. But tough to do.
- Learning copilots. -> This is a compelling direction.

Learning ecosystems around tools -> Notion, Replit, Figma, Midjourney.

**Long-term:**
- **Global UBI**. We absolutely need some way to raise the baseline. The path to being creative isn't easy - despite all the positives we've associated with it.
### Concluding thoughts

### Notes

**Clarifications**:
- When I say "non-creative", I'm not at all making the claim that it's easier, or that it doesn't require skill. The only difference is the correlation b/w/ inputs and outputs, teachability, and the power law dynamic that arises as a byproduct.
- Clarify what I mean by Triplebyte failing - it's a "failure" only in the sense of being a venture backed business that set out to disrupt hiring and education for the world. It could have sustained itself as a moderate, small business, and there's nothing wrong with that, but that's not going to solve the massive education problem we have on our plates.

**This is great:**
(Basically, something along the lines of "creativity isn't necessarily fun."). It's a brutal process, especially if your livelihood depends on it.
- There is no fairness in how selection happens in creative domains.
- Scarce signals are required to stand out in creative fields. This is why I think elite college opaque admissions processes actually make sense. Stanford will be a better experience because of its opaque admissions. In an alternate world in which those that do the best in a standardized test get to the top colleges, elite institutions would likely lose their ability to produce better (on average) talent.
- Similarly, YC has an extremely opaque admissions process. You simply can't have standardized / formula based approaches to admissions / hiring in creative domains.

"- We're designed to minimize risk. Alternatives don't exist because as the bar for creativity increases, all paths are becoming risky. Therefore, when every path is risky, you're going to choose the path that "seems" the least risky: college - since it worked for a previous version of the world." - nice dialogue, not sure where to insert. Think about the most elegant way to make this point.

---
### Todo
- Coming back to education: standardized education doesn't work for creative skills because you can't say with confidence whether someone with an education in that creative skill can actually make a living doing it after graduating.
- Therefore, in creative domains, the transactional educational business model in which we pay an upfront “tuition” (and often take out a loan to do so) in exchange for an education that we hope will enable us to build a career no longer works.
