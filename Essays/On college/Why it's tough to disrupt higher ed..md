Higher education is rotting. It needs transformation, but it's been surprisingly hard to change it.
### Problems with higher education

There's a growing skill gap: a growing gap between the skills a new grad has, and what they actually need in order to create value in this world. [1]

Outside of a handful of the top colleges, new grads, across the world, are finding it tough to land a job, even in some of the most in-demand fields like Tech. And it's not necessarily because there haven't been opportunities. The demand for talent across domains is high, but the supply isn't competent enough to take advantage of it.

Personally, I've interviewed a couple dozen engineers in India and found that most don't have a basic understanding of programming. I've also been closely involved with helping some students from a US state college job hunt, and found that most students in their CS program don't know how to build software when they graduated. They had to pick up relevant skills on their own in order to have a shot at landing a job.

And this is the most in-demand field: Tech! I can only imagine job prospects for people studying something like, say, marketing are. Or business. What the hell do these people end up after graduating? 

Despite these poor outcomes, going to a 4 year college for an education is still the most popular aspiration for most high school grads. There doesn't seem to be a good alternate mainstream choice.

Unfortunately, I don't think colleges are well positioned to bridge the skill gap because the incentives don't exist.

The top college programs want to remain exclusive. That's part of what makes them highly valued.e

- The incentives don't exist for a college's program to train for the real world. 
	- Why not? -> explain this in depth, I think it's an important point to drive home, the rest of the essay relies on reader agreeing that college isn't going to lead to the learning transformation we need.
- Exclusivity is something they want to retain, and understandably so. Even MIT - all they do is Opencourseware, but they wouldn't want to dilute the power of the MIT credential by giving it to more people. The value is in the exclusivity.
	- I'd bet most of the value of college comes from peer group: discussing, and creating with others in a safe environment - to be the greatest value. Certain classes might have been beneficial 
- Exponential change => greater leverage => less insulation from the markets => companies adapt far more quickly to changing environment => can no longer hire a bunch of candidates 
### Why attempts to transform higher education have "failed"

While these attempts might not have failed from a business sense, I'd argue they've failed to make a meaningful dent in how most people move through the "education system".

Most high schoolers continue to aspire to get into the traditional higher education pipeline despite how poorly it's performing. The average aspiration for most people is to still find a way to go to a college, often taking obscene loans in order to do so.

But I want to be clear, I have nothing but deep respect for anyone that had dedicated their effort to tackling problems in this space, regardless of their outcomes. It's not easy to build systems that fundamentally change human behavior, especially when the behavior is so deeply entrenched due to various reasons. While there have been some frauds, the majority of the actors in this space were well intentioned from what I can tell.

We've seen various types of attempts:

0. Learning aids to crack existing exams. (content, cheat sheets, etc.)
1. MOOCs.
2. Bootcamps.
3. Alternate, accessible credentialing: Triplebytes of the world. I was quite behind this idea, and I still think it could make sense.
4. Cohort based / community based learning.

Coding bootcamps, massive online courses, and many Ed-Tech startups that started off with the ambition to disrupt how we learn have failed to make a meaningful dent in our education system. But they haven't made a meaningful difference to our education system.
1. Business model doesn't work out: paying high up front fees to receive knowledge 

**Big problem**: because outcomes come so far after the inputs, people can't afford to take a risk in the same way they can with Uber / Instacart / any other product they use.
And the more they value an education, the more risk averse they would be to take an alternate path (on average).

**Cultural**:
- As the world becomes more difficult to create value in, due to increased fear, people will run towards the only signals they've known to actually work: a college education from a reputed institute. 
	- Lower trust environment, more chaos => greater craving for scarce credentials that signal competence. (Reference Kunal Shah's point about Trust systems here).

**Economic challenges**:
- All the bootcamps went from "Going to change the world" to "Help people make a transition to a higher paying software engineering job.".
- Circumventing upfront tuition is tough. (no familiarity / collection from bad actors?)
- Longer than 1 year breaks the financial equation that enables bootcamps.
- ISAs analysis. This is important to break down well (summarize both what Austen and the other dude said).

**Technological**:
- The power of AI.

Maybe it just takes time and future iterations of these same ideas will click as we pass a tipping point in people losing faith in higher ed.

The interesting thing here is that while these attempts might have "failed", it's also true that the best learning content is likely on the internet in some shape / form. Access has been democratized, but the content is unfortunately a small piece of the learning puzzle.

Community, personalized feedback
### Promising changes 

*(I plan to expand each of these into essays of their own. These are shorter summaries. There are many potential cons to these approaches that we'd have to flesh out)*
 
1. **Being able to invest in individuals**. (I.e. Friends.tech but based on talent for a specific skill). - a new financial / legal mechanism that rewards identifying diamonds in the rough, and the early part of nurturing. This is the financial instrument we need in order to align long-term incentives. Yes, there are huge downsides to this.
	1. This could be coupled with a significantly better "exam" - if you pass, you get an investment. Anyone can take this at many centers around the world. What is the forcing function for the exam to be really good?
2. **AI** - we're incredibly early on and so the angles aren't that clear yet. But one domain in which AI (large language models) are incredible teachers is in constrained domains like programming for which there's ample data online of people teaching each other, AND there's an objectively verifiable output that lets you check whether what you're being told is true or not. The most important impact of this is to be able to scale personalized, tailored feedback in-the-loop (as you're doing.).
	1. Copilots
	2. Feedback systems.
3. **Learning vouchers**: instead of subsidizing higher education institutes, I think it would be useful to just reimburse learning. Let people mix and match the best learning resources they can find. I think the internet savvy individuals will find ways to invest this learning capital into programs that far outperform going to their local college / state school.
4. **Tools becoming the teachers**. When a community forms around a tool, a powerful learning ecosystem develops, that's actually grounded directly in creating value.

It could be that what disrupts higher education won't even be called an "education" company.
### Notes
- "The overall college enrollment rate for 18- to 24-year-olds decreased from 41 percent in 2010 to 38 percent in 2021" - ehttps://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/cpb/college-enrollment-rate
	- Enrollment rate decreasing in the US, but increasing globally (especially in Asia).

Coursera's ARR (https://investor.coursera.com/news/news-details/2023/Coursera-Reports-Second-Quarter-2023-Financial-Results/default.aspx) isn't that much more than a single college's ARR (Harvard's is somewhere b/w/ $300m - $400m). And Coursera's is on par with similar MOOC platforms. 

The problem is they've just taken the offline credentialing and learning style and stuck it online without thinking from first principles whether students learn well in colleges despite the lecturing medium, or because of it.

Coding bootcamps similarly took off in the mid '10's claiming to transform education. 
### Todo
- Check CSU Monterey Bay computer science rankings. Gautam's education sucked, and I want to get a sense for how.
- Are there any potential concerns to address?
	- Why do we need a transformation? Things will figure themselves out on their own no?
- What about: 
### Cut
It's a serious uphill battle to go up against traditional education systems. My intention with this essay isn't to be critical of those that have tried to shape education for the better, I have great respect for them. They've actually tackled the problem, while I've just been sitting on the sidelines and seeing what's happening. From what I can tell, the majority of them have made honest efforts to do so. It's just that there have incredibly challenging hurdles to overcome from all angles.

- History:
	- What was the purpose of the college degree?
	- When did it become the gateway to the "upper class"?
	- It has a strong aspirational brand.
	- Personal family history: education was literally the only path to economic wellbeing for your family. In fact, without a good education and job prospects, you'd likely find it difficult to get married as well - in an arranged marriage driven society (India even today).
	- Designed for a different world.

(history of why college was created seems out of place for this essay. Can dig into this in another essay perhaps.).

Startups managed to disrupt many industries, but sadly they haven't been able to shake the education system much - especially higher education.

Firstly, what's the problem with our education system that even warrants "disrupting"?
