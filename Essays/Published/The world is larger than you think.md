Earlier today I came across this video on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V3LR91X-vQ about a farmer in rural India explaining how he grows crops.

It made me think about how I live in an echo-chamber - my world revolves around technology & films, and my social feeds reflect this.

When I come across random videos like this outside of my core interests, and when I travel to other parts of the world, I realize that very few people care about the kinds of things I care about.

It's a relief.

When I'm reminded of the world beyond my bubble, I find that I'm less affected by FOMO and hype because I see how insignificant my bubble is in the context of the larger world. Perhaps in the same way that when you zoom out and see that the world is just a pale blue dot in the vast universe, it's easier to see how absurd / silly many of our daily frustrations are.
