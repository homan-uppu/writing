**What's that body of knowledge, and way to communicate that knowledge, that will unlock the human potential?**

**Done**:
1. Be attached to outcomes, not the means.

**Upcoming** (no order):
- Why college is outdated.
- The skills that matter
- Hidden knowledge

**Ideas**:
- Catering to the algorithm vs. artistry. (This could just be a reference to Hassan's segment).
- Proof of competence.
- Creativity is eating the world.
- On communicating well (an expansion piece - from the seed in "Skills that matter").

Breaking down the "Why college is outdated angle":
- Why college is outdated (this is actually the right essay, you just have to write it very differently, and more tightly scoped).
- Being able to invest in individuals. (find a better title, but basically, need to explore this idea in a succinct way).
- Creativity is eating the world (a quick observation on how the world is changing )
- Evolution of knowledge work (or software engineering).
- Why hiring is opaque.

After all of these are published, I'm going to spend a week contemplating the next project, and then I'm going to follow [[How to go about building the next project]] to bring it to life the right way. Amen.
