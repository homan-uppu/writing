We have more knowledge available to us than ever before in humanity.

For any skill we want to learn, there likely exists an optimal set of information out there, that would best help us learn that skill.

How good that optimal set is depends on…

So, when people claim you can learn whatever you want through the internet, I think they’re technically right, but what I’ve seen is that it’s very tough for most of us to find that optimal set - especially when we’re beginners and don’t have the context of the space and who’s good and what techniques work, etc.

It takes significant effort to compile the best content to consume to learn something, because you need to get them from people that understand the space you’re in well.

And sure, sometimes they may recommend popular content to consume, but you need that validation before you embark on the path.

I’ve found that the most popular content is often not the best, or at the least incomplete. And the better I get at a skill, the worse the popular content feels as an aid to learn something.

I wish we had a way to capture this information better. Id like to see a list of recommended content to consume from those that have clearly demonstrated their competence in a skill, or are at least a few steps ahead of you on the path.

Right now the only way I can think of is to:
- Ask people I know who are in the space to give me consumption recommendations.
- Cold email.
- Scour platforms for popular content on the topic, and try my best to analyze it to see if it makes sense and if it’s high quality (and as I mentioned, it’s tough to do that as a beginner).
- Go to Twitter to find people who I know are great at their craft, scroll through their feed to find links that they’ve shared, or any content they’ve created and see if any are relevant to consume to get good at the skill they’re great at. (This is super fucking time consuming lol). And you don’t want everything they talk about, you specifically want the content they recommend to learn the craft.

I would do these in tandem.

And the deeper you get into a space, further your perception of what the beginner knows is from reality. And so many masters I know don’t share things because they feel everyone knows it whereas they don’t.

How would you incentivize people to share the content they found helpful on their learning path such that it was easily accessible to those that want to understand that path better.

This would enable a solid feed of content.
