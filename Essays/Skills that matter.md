### Ability to seek truth

This is having the skill to ask the right questions, run the right experiments, reach the right conclusions, and having the strength to keep iterating to improve your understanding of the truth about something.

In order for your work to create value, it needs to be aligned with reality.

A product can't generate revenue if it doesn't solve an actual problem. Art won't be valued if it doesn't resonate with our minds. 

Similarly, I don't think we can be happy without understanding the truths of our own minds so that we use it in ways that brings us peace instead of suffering.
### Good taste

Having good intuition about what to work on, who to work with, where to live, who to marry, etc.

I believe reasoning alone isn't enough to optimally make the best decisions in many aspects of our lives. Some people have a good gut "feel" that enables them to make better choices.

They end up at the right place at the right time with the right people doing the right things. And they're rewarded for it by achieving what they want to, and generally having better lives.

Some people do this so consistently well that I believe it's more skill than luck.
### Communicating well

If you want to do anything meaningful, you'll need to be able communicate your ideas well.

Communicating is how you turn ideas into reality. Communicating is about representing your idea in a form that can be understood by others, so that you can work with them to bring ideas to life. The best ideas are the outcome of multiple minds working together, and communicating is the bridge between minds.

Importantly, communicating well aligns various "you"s. Each of us has multiple versions of ourselves which are often at odds with each other. The process of communicating builds clarity so that it's easier to align the various parts of ourselves to work together more cohesively.

Communicating helps you have good ideas in the first place. I agree with PG: ""

As AI understands human forms of expression better, your ability to communicate well will be the limiting factor for how much AI can help you achieve what you want.

Generally, I think we underestimate how important communicating well is, which is why we invest so little time honing this skill relative to its value.
