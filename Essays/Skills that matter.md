### Ability to seek truth

In order for your work to be valued, it needs to be aligned with reality. Your product can't generate revenue if it doesn't solve an actual problem. Your art won't be valued if it doesn't strike at the truth of who we are.

The ability to seek truth is about being able to run a scientific process to uncover the truth about something.

Asking the right questions, forming the right hypotheses, running the right experiments, interpreting results accurately and continuing to iterate to improve your understanding about something.
### Good taste

Having good intuition about what to work on, who to work with, where to live, who to marry, etc.

I believe reasoning alone isn't enough to optimally make the best decisions in many aspects of our lives. Some people have a good gut "feel" that enables them to make better choices.

They end up at the right place at the right time with the right people doing the right things. And they're rewarded for it by achieving what they want to, and generally having better lives.

Some people do this so consistently well that I believe taste more skill than luck.
### Communicating well

If you want to do anything meaningful, you'll need to be able communicate your ideas well.

Communicating is how you turn ideas into reality. Communicating well lets you represent your idea in a form that can be understood by others, so that you can work with them to bring ideas to life. The best ideas are the outcome of multiple minds working together, and communicating is the bridge between minds.

At a personal level, communicating well aligns the various "you"s. Each of us has multiple versions of ourselves that are often at odds with each other. The process of communicating builds clarity so that it's easier to align the various parts of ourselves to work together more cohesively.

Communicating helps you have good ideas.

As AI better understands us, your ability to communicate well will be the limiting factor for how well AI can help you achieve what you want.

Generally, I think we underestimate how important communicating well is, which is why we invest so little time honing this skill relative to its value.
