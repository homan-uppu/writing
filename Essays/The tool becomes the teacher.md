A tool reduces the friction to create.

As more people use the tool to create, a community forms. Members share their knowledge, write guides, answer questions, and share their excitement for the tool.

The tool then lets you see what others have created with it, to learn from, and to even "remix" someone else's creation: copy & modify it to meet your needs.

Next comes the social layer: people can vote on creations so that the most popular ones get greater distribution. This can even look like a marketplace where you can buy and sell creations.

Then an AI copilot is embedded directly into the tool to teach you and remind you of best practices, as you're creating.

A collection of { tool, community, marketplace, AI } is essentially a learning ecosystem: people can go there to learn how to use the tool to create value. And the entire ecosystem is incentivized to help new creators become skilled - in a way that traditional educational entities necessarily aren't.
### Examples

Replit
Figma
TikTok
Midjourney
### Incentives
- Platform wants to enable more creators cheaply - because the more they create, the better the platform does.
- This is quite different from traditional learning systems in which you pay to receive knowledge about something.
- Doesn't work for all creative skills ofc (what are some good counter examples to this?)
### Notes
4 components of tool based learning ecosystems
1. Tool
2. Community
3. AI
4. Marketplace

The right incentives for a learning ecosystem:
- Anyone can come and learn for free / cheap - because the platform is incentivized to enable more creators. Knowledge isn't something you pay to receive, but the tool is directly incentivized to make you good at creating with it - because if you create value, the community wins, and the tool also wins.
