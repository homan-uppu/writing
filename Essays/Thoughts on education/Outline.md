### Problem
- Educational institutes are failing across the board. No compelling, structured, alternate higher education path exists despite the clear lack of outcomes.
- Engineer statistics from various countries: it's not a pretty picture for sure. Many fail to secure jobs. They're not ready to create value.
- Student loan debts.
- Before you counter saying that {top_college} has a great undergrad program and graduates seem to be doing well, these are < 1% of all college grads. The world is far larger than the top 1% of educational programs in the world. And, we can't assume causation: that graduates are successful **because** of the educational program and not despite it. And what is success? That they were able to land a job after college? What if they graduated during a boom vs. flailing economy? What other external factors contribute to 
- I think most people in my circles aren't paranoid about this because:
	1. If you went to a high quality college, you tend to believe that's the baseline for the rest of the world.
	2. We don't understand exponential change intuitively. These cracks can break very quickly as the world rapidly evolves - faster than ever before.
- Colleges don't have the right incentives to create the best learning systems.
	- Colleges don't have the incentives to force them to build the best learning systems. Needs to be tied to market performance. And any performance indicators are lagging indicators / potentially not the right metrics.
	- Often companies have to hire unqualified candidates and train them, but this still looks like a "success" to institutions.
- A decade ago I was quite confident that we'd see a massive shift in how people learn in a decade. That belief was both correct and incorrect. Correct in that the world has changed so much that the fundamental ways in which we learn and consume information (via content networks, on our phones, all the time) is quite different, and this difference has seeped into 
### Failed attempts to redefine education
It seems every few years there's a handful of fresh attempts at "solving education" for the world. But they've all fallen short. The standard of education for 99.9% of people in the world is still the average, inadequate, college experience.
- MOOCS - I'd count these a failure. Look at the stats, the revenue, etc.
- Bootcamps / vocational schools.
	- Incentives are too short-term. Very difficult to be long-term thinking in this regard.
- Alt accredited colleges (Make school). - Similar short-term incentives forced them to resemble traditional education system - in between traditional and bootcamps.
- The first wave of education startups enhanced ability to succeed in traditional education systems, but didn't question whether succeeding in that system was actually worthwhile.
### Changing world (growing creativity threshold)
- Exponentially increasing leverage.
- Smaller companies with less insulation / delay from the market. Gone are the days of massive companies that guarantee a lifetime career. And the companies that guarantee that will be outcompeted.
- Higher creativity bar to be able to create value in this world. The more creative a domain, the more it follows a power law distribution.
- The greater the required creativity, the more different the training methods to generate creativity, and less guarantees on actually becoming competent enough to be able to create value.
- As the creativity threshold increases for work, "creator economics" will take over most domains. 
	- Creator economics: power law distributions (reference Andrew Chen, Li, the OnlyFans case study).
	- It will be increasingly difficult for a "middle class".
### What is high quality education in this new world?
- Let's start with the outcomes we want: 
- Given a higher creativity bar to thrive in this world, general education systems need to look more like learnings systems in creative domains: **Learn by doing, with mentorship**.
- Theory alone doesn't mean much.
- Define the outcomes you think are worth training for in order to thrive in this world.
- Current education system doesn't even want to optimize for these outcomes.
### Transformation
Big shifts that change how we learn:
1. AI (tools become the teacher) - learning ecosystems forming around tools of creation, powered by AI.
2. Economic: Universal basic income / ability to invest in individuals (Put in 100k now, and have the opportunity to invest in future businesses / have a share in the outcomes generated.)
	1. This aligns incentives.
	2. **Creates a market for identifying and nurturing promising talent**. Today, there's not much of a reward for those that succeed at the earlier stages of the education funnel. And rewards those at the earlier stages of the learning process. Right now those at the earlier end of the spectrum are committing themselves through good intentions, without financial reward - a flimsy foundation to build a robust education system.
### The future of learning
- Unbundling education. Learning "packs".
- Learning ecosystems form around tools to create.
- Design. Code. Filmography / video editing (Replit, Figma, TikTok).
- An economy around 
### Notes
- Understanding creator economics: power law distributions (reference Andrew Chen, Li, the OnlyFans case study).

### Todo
- Algorithmically determined demand.
**Learning ecosystems around tools**
- (Tool -> Community -> AI -> Market).
- The role of the AI copilot.
1. Create a system with the right incentives.
2. Start with higher education because it's closest to the  market. Find the solution here, and then back-propagate to earlier education. 
3. Less regulatory resistance. People willing to take bets on alternate higher education far more than they are to take a bet on
