I've been desperately waiting for the day higher education systems would be replaced by far more affordable, AND higher quality learning systems that are personalized to individuals and accessible from anywhere in the world.

For the last 10 years I've seen dozens of startups attempt to fundamentally disrupt and redefine higher education. But they've failed to make a meaningful dent.

The problem is only getting worse:
- **The skill gap is growing**: i.e. the diff (skill that new grads posses, the skill you need to create value in this world).
	- Plenty of references for this point - from around the world... Basically look at all the colleges that aren't in the top 10 in their respective countries. And look at the outcome diffs between them all.
- **Educational investments don't have returns.** => massive student debt in developed world.
- **Most higher education sucks.** Outside of the top programs, most suck.

Colleges aren't set up to bridge this skill gap.
- The incentives don't exist for a college's program to train for the real world. 
	- Why not? -> explain this in depth, I think it's an important point to drive home, the rest of the essay relies on reader agreeing that college isn't going to lead to the learning transformation we need.
- Exclusivity is something they want to retain, and understandably so. Even MIT - all they do is opencourseware, but they wouldn't want to dilute the power of the MIT credential by giving it to more people.
- History:
	- What was the purpose of the college degree?
	- When did it become the gateway to the "upper class"?
	- It has a strong aspirational brand.
	- Personal family history: education was literally the only path to economic wellbeing for your family. In fact, without a good education and job prospects, you'd likely find it difficult to get married as well - in an arranged marriage driven society (India even today).
	- Designed for a different world.
- Exponential change => greater leverage => less insulation from the markets => companies adapt far more quickly to changing environment => can no longer hire a bunch of candidates 

It's a serious uphill battle to go up against traditional education systems. My intention with this essay isn't to be critical of those that have tried to shape education for the better, I have great respect for them. They've actually tackled the problem, while I've just been sitting on the sidelines and seeing what's happening. From what I can tell, the majority of them have made honest efforts to do so. It's just that there have incredibly challenging hurdles to overcome from all angles: 
1. Cultural.
2. Psychological.
3. Economic.
4. Technological.

Coding bootcamps, massive online courses, and many Ed-Tech startups that started off with the ambition to disrupt how we learn have failed to make a meaningful dent in our education system. But they haven't made a meaningful difference to our education system.
1. Business model doesn't work out: paying high up front fees to receive knowledge 
### Cultural
- As the world becomes more difficult to create value in, due to increased fear, people will run towards the only signals they've known to actually work: a college education from a reputed institute.
	- Lower trust environment, more chaos => greater craving for scarce credentials that signal competence.
### Economic
- All the bootcamps went from "Going to change the world" to "Help people make a transition to a higher paying software engineering job.".
- Circumventing upfront tuition is tough.
- Longer than 1 year breaks the financial equation that lets 
### Technological

- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35210421&p=2 (More students are turning away from colleges, towards apprenticeships). -> I have to dig into this to see what the actual numbers are.

- The lies that all colleges are good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz4VYFAQGaA - exclusivity -> hilarious. Definitely reference this.

Coursera's ARR (https://investor.coursera.com/news/news-details/2023/Coursera-Reports-Second-Quarter-2023-Financial-Results/default.aspx) isn't that much more than a single college's ARR (Harvard's is somewhere b/w/ $300m - $400m). And Coursera's is on par with similar MOOC platforms. 

The problem is they've just taken the offline credentialing and learning style and stuck it online without thinking from first principles whether students learn well in colleges despite the lecturing medium, or because of it.

Coding bootcamps similarly took off in the mid '10's claiming to transform education.
