Asymmetry exist in all aspects of our lives.

Only a small percentage of decisions are responsible for most outcomes.
Only a small percentage of the options for a given decision are viable.
Only a small difference in ability accounts for a large difference in results.

We suck at getting what we want because we're terrible at seeking out asymmetries in the areas that matter to us. We suck at it even if we believe that such asymmetries exist because we don't have the appropriate emotional response to equality.

When we believe two things are equal - in any sense of equal, we should be quite alarmed. In the best case scenario, equality is often due to not knowing enough. But more often it's due to us deluding ourselves by seeing the world the way we want it to be, not as it is.

This is incredibly counterintuitive to most of us because such asymmetry is a recent phenomena. For most of human history we didn't have such asymmetry, and therefore our collective culture, and perhaps even our evolutionary programming, haven't given us the appropriate emotional conditioning to give us an intuition for it.

I also believe asymmetry is becoming more extreme. Rapidly. That means that the cost of not seeking asymmetry well is rising: those that suck at it uncovering hidden asymmetries in the world will feel the pain increasingly so.

What causes asymmetry? Why is it changing the way it is? How exactly do we suffer by not uncovering asymmetries? What can we do about it?
