Asymmetry exist in all aspects of our lives.

Only a small percentage of decisions are responsible for most outcomes.
Only a small percentage of the options for a given decision are viable.
Only a small difference in ability accounts for a large difference in results.

We suck at getting what we want because we're terrible at seeking out asymmetries in the areas that matter to us. We suck at it even if we believe that such asymmetries exist because we don't have the appropriate emotional response to equality.

When we believe two things are equal - in any sense of equal, we should be quite alarmed. In the best case scenario, equality is often due to not knowing enough. But more often it's due to us deluding ourselves by seeing the world the way we want it to be, not as it is.

This is incredibly counterintuitive to most of us because such asymmetry is a recent phenomena. For most of human history we didn't have such asymmetry, and therefore our collective culture, and perhaps even our evolutionary programming, haven't given us the appropriate emotional conditioning to give us an intuition for it.

I also believe asymmetry is becoming more extreme. Rapidly. That means that the cost of not seeking asymmetry well is rising: those that suck at it uncovering hidden asymmetries in the world will feel the pain increasingly so.

What causes asymmetry? Why is it becoming more extreme? How exactly do we suffer by not uncovering asymmetries? And what can we do about it?

...

Most human endeavors can be modeled as a game: we want something and we figure out how to get what we want by making choices. When we get what we want we feel some satiation that makes us want more of it.

The want can be anything: to build a great company, make a great movie, be a better partner, listener, have more compassion, etc. 

The pattern we follow to get what we want resembles a decision tree. At each point in the tree we're faced with many options. We choose one option and go further down in the tree where we face more options. We may also backtrack and take different paths.

To be clear this is an incredibly reductive model. The current model is missing a great deal of nuance, I believe it's directionally correct and the right level of nuance to be able to explain asymmetry. *(note: In reality there are many nuances to this process that cause weird behaviors. For example, oftentimes we become addicted to following a particular path rather than even getting what we want - i.e. what we created that path for. I believe exploring that nuance is important to shed light on the human condition, but I'll save that for another essay.)*

Modeling our pursuit of fulfilling our wants as a game is useful because we can study its features by studying simpler games that we're much better at, and then extrapolating to the more complex games that we need to play to get the things we want in the world.

...

The primary cause for asymmetry is complexity. Complexity is the number of possibilities in the game decision tree. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_complexity)

To study how asymmetry is a function of complexity, let's look at three games: Tic Tac Toe (simple), Chess (medium complexity), Go (high complexity).

The following become apparent as we move from a simple game to more complex games:
- The number of truly equal states decreases as a percentage of all states.
- Calculation becomes less valuable as a tool the more complex the game becomes, and intuition is used more.
- 


...

The games we play in life are far, far more complex than the games we discussed above. There are more possible decisions. Each game lasts longer (often till we die). Which means that the true asymmetry in our endeavors should be much, much greater than what we see in simpler games.

But why then for much of human history we haven't really seen such asymmetry? In the industrial age, many workers were paid similar wages. Even as recently as a couple of decades ago, there was a strong middle class that led similar lives because they made similar amounts of money. Our education systems have been designed to produce similarly knowledgeable graduates.

There are a few reasons:
- Freedom to do what you want.
- Leverage.
- 

I believe the reason isn't that the underlying asymmetry was different, but rather that 

...

Our emotional response is outdated.

(a graph of gdp, with the flat part circled to show what we are conditioned for, and how the nature of the world, what works in the world, the level of symmetry in that world is vastly different than the part that we're in now).

Some emotional responses are conditioned through evolution. Others are conditioned through cultural impressions. We all likely feel shock when we hear a loud bang near us, or the feeling of a snake rubbing up against our foot on a walk. This is evolutionary conditioning.

An example of cultural conditioning is my fear of debt. When I was young my family was in a great deal of debt. We lived in India where there weren't many formal avenues to take loans and therefore my family took a large informal loan for a business that didn't work out. Debt collection was carried out by goons. The stories I heard from my mother growing up about how disgusting that situation made her feel has given me a great aversion towards debt. I've never had a credit card. The times I borrowed a bit from a friend I wasn't able to sleep well at night. My cultural conditioning has made me despise owing someone something and being answerable to them.

I'm actively working on reducing my aversion towards debt because I think it's too extreme 

We lack the cultural conditioning for equality.
