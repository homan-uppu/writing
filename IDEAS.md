# Writing
## personal
- on **mastering the mind**, and why this is my highest priority. Write this for yourself. No need to even share this with the world.
## general

- Something about Nature unfolding, and surrendering to the process. [[Nature]]. Let go. Surrender. Trust in the forces beyond yourself.
- [[History was brutal]]
- Intellectual rigor / writing culture: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sV8YuM6WMcGWHpMCUMG8gnm2rf8hqeB6ob6VpDnOhdA/edit?tab=t.0. Perhaps this ought to go in a larger essay re. building the best team.
- moving towards fair compensation for the value you create in the world
	- monetization of true value.
	- everything will have a price tag... maybe even love.
	- capitalization of everything.
- I'm going to follow my natural curiosity no matter what.
	- This is more a vow of commitment to myself. I'm not going to sacrifice my natural exploration no matter what. I believe it is my duty to, and that by doing so I am best respecting what Nature has given me.
- Taking money always comes with obligations. If not explicit, then at least subconsciously.
	- Why startups take too long to scrap their idea / pivot.
	- Why individuals spend too long in a career that isn't their natural strength.
	- Why any raising money will come with the caveat that seeking truth is the most important thing. Nothing else matters.
	*! this should actually be a part of Seeking truth essay. A part of that essay should also be about cleverly designing your life so that you can effectively seek truth. That's probably a massive section, and may even end up being a separate essay. Fascinating.*
- [[Robert Greene (Mastery) Finding your calling]].
- AI assisted writing.
- [[A better way for creative teams to work]]
- companies with only founders (founder-only-companies).
	- building companies that stay relevant for decades.
	- can't imagine starting a company without first thinking this through.
- The era of American dominance. - this geopolitics is actually quite important to understand. And it's even more important to understand that America's "moat" isn't AI, or some other technology, but rather talent and its freedom to work on what they want. the free market is the moat.
- [[cultural conditioning]]
- Optimizing for economic growth always wins.
- Publishing schedules prevent great work.
- [[You cannot pick and choose what grows (everything deep connected).]]
- [[The pursuit of beauty.]]
- utility wins at the end of the day
	- why we will welcome AI with open arms even if there's a looming possibility of calamity on the horizon. short term utility > ambiguous long-term problem.
- tokenized individual - (this is the start of a fractal exploration of topics)
- English driven programming. (a product exploration for what building apps ought to look like in the intelligence age). - just toying around with this idea.
- praising Avi's ability to think big and why i feel we're missing more of this.
- what i want in a co-founder.
- it's a generalist's paradise.
- in the long run product always wins.
# Products
## small products
- [[A tool for writing]] *(someone else should build this. This is far from the highest leverage thing you can do. You can build a great business out of this, but.... Be careful about what you commit to! And, the consumption product is more powerful than this creation one bec. AI is far more useful when aiding with consumption, than it is with creating).
- [[Person DB - to grow relationships with the best.]]
- Hire someone to chat with when you write: https://x.com/visakanv/status/1527658765058646021.
- A simple person capture. with the same flow as saving to are.na / cosmos, but for individuals that I want to connect with. - perhaps just use the are.na API to listen to items added to the "People" collection.
- xnote++ (revisit xnote and explore what this would look like today).
- braindump.ai (the voice notes app) - build the best possible app to capture, sculpt, and share your thoughts. make it the best app in this category.
- writing feedback copilot.
- long-form writing platform (for things like Balaji's "Network state", or really any really long blogpost that deserves a great presentation).
- an app in mac os (or a chrome plugin) that reads what's happening on screen and pops into picture whenever it thinks you're getting distracted. you have to then convince it that you're actually using it for positive purposes for it to leave you alone. UnhookedGPT. this actually makes sense - it allows for a much more granular way to prevent distractions without completely blocking sites that you may still need to visit in order to get your work done.
- easy way to learn a new language / translation app to use when you're in a place where they speak a language you don't understand.
## companies
- [[Power law productions, inc.]]
- **curated knowledge platform**. Curated by me. The best knowledge available on the internet for those trying to be 10^n. In the age of power laws, having the right mental models about how the world actually works is an invaluable aid.
	- not just content, but also people. with my own (and AI) commentaries about why this knowledge is important / why the creator is someone worth trusting (i.e. what their background is, etc.).
	- a focus on the timeless. the mental models that are relevant for at least a decade or so.
	- this feels most resonant with my natural curiosities about the world. i could lean into this for life. dedicating my entire life towards such a worthwhile project.
	- build slowly. allow the compounding to happen. be patient my friend.
- a way for teams to create and manage knowledge bases to share with their users (or even internally). tools to add and manage what data the AI system is grounded on. and an absolutely stellar user experience. - there is a ton of value here. and this is the foundation to build more powerful AI systems, and experiences - down the line. there's something quite powerful here that is worth exploring. Vercel quality platform for building and managing AI agents. and perhaps also a place to have discussions. i would study how the Nextjs, and Midjourney ecosystems manage their communities. would be great learning.
## stories i want to tell
- the young drop out that finds his own path to success. that struggles to find the courage to follow his natural inclinations, his natural genius, his god given gifts, no matter what the world thinks of him. no matter how much the world shames him. a tribute to the the misfits, the rebels, the creatives, the crazy geniuses.
