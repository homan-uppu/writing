## product ideas
#### small projects to get the juices flowing
- xnote++ (revisit xnote and explore what this would look like today).
- braindump.ai (the voice notes app) - build the best possible app to capture, sculpt, and share your thoughts. make it the best app in this category.
- writing feedback copilot.
- long-form writing platform (for things like Balaji's "Network state", or really any really long blogpost that deserves a great presentation).
- an app in mac os (or a chrome plugin) that reads what's happening on screen and pops into picture whenever it thinks you're getting distracted. you have to then convince it that you're actually using it for positive purposes for it to leave you alone. UnhookedGPT. this actually makes sense - it allows for a much more granular way to prevent distractions without completely blocking sites that you may still need to visit in order to get your work done.
- easy way to learn a new language / translation app to use when you're in a place where they speak a language you don't understand.
#### big ideas.
- tokenized individual: allow others to invest in you in exchange for equity in everything that you will own and create from that point onwards. - the economic infrastructure for the age of intelligence. the mechanism through which UBI will be offered to individuals.
- a way for teams to create and manage knowledge bases to share with their users (or even internally). tools to add and manage what data the AI system is grounded on. and an absolutely stellar user experience. - there is a ton of value here. and this is the foundation to build more powerful AI systems, and experiences - down the line. there's something quite powerful here that is worth exploring. Vercel quality platform for building and managing AI agents. and perhaps also a place to have discussions. i would study how the Nextjs, and Midjourney ecosystems manage their communities. would be great learning.
