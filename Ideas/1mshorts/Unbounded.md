We're born with a fire.

Flaming brightly.
Without a care for others. Or the rules of the world.
We are Unbounded.
*A child glowing red (representing the vital fire within).*
*This child jumps.*
*The child runs wildly*
*The child rolls around in mud*

As we develop, we be become less free.
*A teenager picks up a drink to fit in.*
*A teenage girl scrolls through social media, comparing herself to others.*

We compare.
We compete.
We crave to be seen.
To be respected.
We bind ourselves.

Then, we spend the rest of our lives desperately seeking the Unbounded.
Most of us fail.
