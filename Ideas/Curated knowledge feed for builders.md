### Problem
It’s difficult to find quality knowledge.
Most people are misled into consuming low quality knowledge thinking it’s high quality.
It’s difficult to determine the quality of a piece of content without spending time consuming it.

Some of the most valuable knowledge is shared by folks with average following (< 50k followers on X). These are the people building generational companies, and yet their wisdom doesn’t reach those that want it.

Popularity doesn’t correlate with quality. In many cases it’s inversely correlated. The most popular hits for a question are often from those that have spent most of their time gaming the ranking system instead of on the quality of the information they share.

Popularity is also a lagging indicator of competence. Advice from the last generation of popular, successful builders and creators doesn’t necessarily translate into useful advice for the current generation. Yet they are the most popular due to compounding.

From the perspective of someone looking to find the most useful knowledge on the internet from credible sources, to help them achieve what they want, it’s a massive challenge to sift through all the information coming their way and accurately discern the quality from the crap.
### Solution
1. **opinionated** **feed** of content for builders that is significantly better than the average feed of content that most builders consume - especially for those new to the game.
2. **Filter.** (Control over the feed?).
3. **Ask any question.** AI answers only according to the curated sources.
4. **People.** A database of vetted builders to learn from.
5. **Information consumption tool.**

### Vision

Enable anyone to train and share their own _**opinionated AI.

### Positioning
Need to position in a way that pulls people to contribute. A selfless intention, for the benefit of the world. This is key. You will have to reach out to many people to get feedback and their own content recommendations to add to the platform. They will need a compelling, selfless vision, to be tempted to help (including, ofc, status for helping out - which I can offer by making it clear what they contributed).
