Target audience: software engineers. (Under-the-hood: target non-native English speaking software engineers. In marketing, target all software engineers).

- Fundamentals feedback: on rules of grammar, spelling, active / passive voice.
- Conciseness.
- "American" English - for fluency when communicating with foreign folks.

For the early users a human-in-the-loop approach to offer the best possible feedback and build a solid understanding of common mistakes.

Exceptional content engine for marketing. I mean absolutely exceptional. Nothing short of captivating lessons on communication in a highly engaging manner. One video a day.

As AI becomes more powerful, evolve into thinking copilot. More sophisticated kinds of feedback. But, don't worry about that for now.

Grow to add value to engineers at all parts of their lifecycle: from job hunting, negotiations, pitching a project internally, writing good comments, writing effective design documents, etc. We will meet engineers at every point they write in English, and serve them. That is the vision.

Design a product / learning experience perfectly tailored to this audience.

Play an extremely long-term game. In terms of the content you create, the quality of the content you produce, etc. Eventually expand the target audience beyond engineering. To all domains. To all forms of communication (audio, video, presentations, etc.).

This will be a long-term slog. A very long-term slog. Patience is key. But, there is certainly a path. Or, at the very least, a good, worthwhile experiment that should add value to the world in a small, yet meaningful, way.

And, you have a fantastic reason to reach out to great engineers and product managers and "borrow" their credibility, their brand. That's a powerful strategy. Amen.
