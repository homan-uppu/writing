There is a series: "Everything is a function of leverage" - in fact this is the series that I'm going to double down on. This is what explains the change in the world.

- Optimal secrecy: *Share more than you feel you should*.
- Optimal thinking vs. acting: *Think more than you feel you should.*
- Optimal ambition: *Be more ambitious than you feel you should.*
- Optimal company structure: *Don't hire employees.*

Before jumping into any essay, spend more time thinking about the big picture here. I'm also seeing my mission unfold: "*Enable those that will advance humanity*." - this is my mission. There is literally nothing more important for me to work on. And this is more specific than just "advance humanity" because it is focused on identifying and empowering individuals. And this is my way of advancing humanity.

OK, finish the asymmetry essay and then write to yourself to prioritize what you think next. There is certainly an optimal priority list that I believe I'm far away from.

- Optimal honesty
- Optimal self awareness: *Study yourself more than you feel you should.*
