*The foundation is set (in Fear Equality). This foundation leads to what I call the "optimal path" to thrive in this new reality. The optimal path has a set of heuristics. I will write an essay for each heuristic. And finally, I will write a single essay that combines all of the heuristics into one. That aggregating essay is tentatively titled: "How to educate yourself".*

*Each heuristic has the following components*
1. What the heuristic is.
2. What the optimality is (for today's leverage).
3. What the optimality will be in the next few years (i.e. how to update when leverage changes).
4. How to be more optimal. (What to implement to actually improve).

*Heuristics:*
- Fear equality (to the degree of leverage, for the things that matter)
- Solve for people (hierarchy of complexity)
- Think more before you do
- Be more transparent (secrecy)
- Don't pay for education (pay to learn outdated)
- Be more ambitious (Ambition is required more than ever)
- Study yourself

*Heuristics without optimality. You should take it as far as you can independent of the leverage in the world.*
- Build intuition.
- Depth is breadth. (Go deep)
- Know what you want
- Don't identify with labels
- Have integrity.
- Overcome Jealousy.
- Build compassion.

*In order to explain heuristics well, there are truths about the world that must be explained*
- We are becoming more similar (culture is converging) - required for "Be more ambitious"
- Changing yourself is more difficult than you think. ("Why I won't work with old people" - probably a better title).
- Maximizing transactions is all we want.
- The best teams work in person.

*Theory*
- [[Intuition separates greats from the rest]]
- [[Think more than you think you should]]
- [[Building is easier than figuring out what to build]]
- [[We are addicted to our beliefs]]
- [[Why secrets aren't as valuable as before]]
- [[Paying for education no longer works]]
- Co-founder only companies
- [[Be more ambitious]] / How to be more ambitious.
- We don't know what we want (on evolution).
- Maximizing transactions is all we want (may not write this, doesn't feel too important compared to many other topics.)
- The best teams will work in person (critically important - this is a foundation for how I will build teams).
- Randomness is an illusion (i.e. you aren't a lottery ticket ). - *this is quite foundational to my worldview, is what I'm realizing.* - Luck vs. skill.
- [[Depth is breadth]] / [[Depth is everything]]
- Learn to quit.
