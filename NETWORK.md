these are people who have at the very least responded to me in the past and have acknowledged my existence, who's competence i believe in. every time you ship something, let every person on this list know. the purpose of your outreach is to grow this list. nothing more. you don't even need people to agree with you. you simply need them to respond and acknowledge your existence. once they do that, they are in this list, and once they are here, i know i can get their attention. this is key. 
**the quality of this list determines the quality of your life.**
