[[investing in NETALA]] + [[elevating the exit criteria]]?

---

Note: I'm not going to publish anything until it is up to the mark. I don't care how long that takes. could very well bleed into next year, I'm OK with that. It is out of my hands.

## Writing
1. Why venture capital will eat education.
2. Seeking truth is the only skill.
3. Age of the individual.
4. Natural expression.

> (By "complete", I mean that they are to the best of my abilities, and they include the visualizations that I want them to have in the final draft. If internet not great, then replace visualizations with a doc describing what they will be in great detail - with sketches).

the specific essays may change, but the number is fixed: 4. note: there is no minimum or maximum length to these. the seeking truth one has less stringent definition of complete because it will be a draft for a long, long, time to come.

but yes, these 4 writings are the foundation.
and then will start an aggressive research phase into personalized tokens - and start putting together the next essay in which i think through what it would take to create a personal token system that at least scales to the ambitious.

think deeply about such a system. and start a path of reading - networkstate, as well as Chris Dixon's book perhaps, and also ground truths: how ETH works, how tokens work, and deeper studies of how friend.tech actually works, why it didn't scale, etc. also need to start studying the legal framework around investing. how companies operate, etc.

## Research

A research system that allows me to share my ongoing research. - the top questions in my mind and what I've learned about each.
- **Research doc of VC eats education** (a list of the key questions to answer, relevant emerging technologies. basically a study doc). - would be great to make this open source. basically a sort of "here are the top questions on my mind and what i'm learning about them." - that would be a great project.
		1. Use AI to help you understand the areas of study required here.
		2. Prob set up a Notion page to get this started. Easier to manage and share, and shifts focus from unnecessary building to the actual research.
Be very thoughtful about this - and also consider not having it.`

## OutreachDB

DB of people to reach out to for essay feedback. I want a list of 100 people who I'd want feedback from - for the essay. Make it a broad audience, with varying reputations: i.e. you want a good chunk of them to be diamonds in the rough - who will shine in due time, and have the spare time to give you feedback. Get connected before their rise. The bigshots will only pay attention if something goes viral.

*This too will be difficult to implement, but perhaps easier than the above bec. I can just go to X profiles and those seem to load reasonably quickly. Yeah, i think that's doable. also need to think through how to store these contacts in some sort of CRM setup / intricate Notion setup so that I can keep track of comms with them.* 

- Lawyers and crypto folks are going to be v. important to talk to re. the actual implementation details of this idea. Basically, to be able to take it from idea -> proposal spec & a plan of action. - actually, this is important. a follow-up essay is absolutely required that goes into the excruciating details of how to create such an investment product. In fact, the next essay is the one that will propel this ideal forward.

DONE

## Personal website

([[Personal site]])
Thorough design process. It should embody my style.
- The essays sub-dir should be its own GIT repo that is public. I'd like a backup reference to any writing in case the site goes down / to have commit timestamps so that I can later see the iterations on the essays, etc. Actually spend time on figuring out the right setup as I want to publish essays to my site for a long time to come.
