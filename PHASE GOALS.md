Note: I'm not going to publish anything until it is up to the mark. I don't care how long that takes. could very well bleed into next year, I'm OK with that. It is out of my hands.
## Things

**Complete drafts of:**
	1. Why venture capital will eat education.
	2. Seeking truth is the only skill.
> (By "complete", I mean that they are to the best of my abilities, and they include the visualizations that I want them to have in the final draft.)

**Personal website overhaul**. Thorough design process and implementation. It should embody my style.
	1. The essays sub-dir should be its own GIT repo that is public. I'd like a backup reference to any writing in case the site goes down / to have commit timestamps so that I can later see the iterations on the essays, etc. Actually spend time on figuring out the right setup as I do want to continue publishing essays on my site.

**DB of people to reach out to for essay feedback**. I want a list of 100 people who I'd want feedback from - for the essay. Make it a broad audience, with varying reputations: i.e. you want a good chunk of them to be diamonds in the rough - who will shine in due time. Get connected before their rise. And people who will actually respond. The bigshots will only pay attention if something goes viral.

Lawyers and crypto folks are going to be v. important to talk to re. the actual implementation details of this idea. Basically, to be able to take it from idea -> proposal spec & a plan of action.

This could morph into a sort of entity that then goes and lobbies / finds ways to build such a technology that is also fully compliant.

**A clear spec of what I'm going to create**. This will likely be a product, but it may not, I'm not 100% sure. It could also be follow-up essays. But, whatever it is, I need to have gone through multiple design iterations of it, and have the MVP fully planned out. Have a memo along with this explaining what I'm trying to create, and why (for myself). And yes, I am going to create something incredible.

## Notes
- If at any point, I'm severely stuck due to poor internet connection / something else, then I will make the necessary changes to be productive. Else, I'm going to stick it out right here until all of these goals are sufficiently met.
