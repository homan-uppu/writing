in order to reach intellectual investors, there's a more direct content strategy: win them over with analysis & a bit more of a philosophical bend:
- power law distribution.
- why income-share-agreements won't work.
- AI & creativity.

(ofc, there's more, but i do feel that writing is the right starting point - to be able to tap into this "elite" audience).
