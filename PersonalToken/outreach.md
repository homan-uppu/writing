i definitely want / need a chrome plugin that parses and adds people to a database who i want to connect with. this will be game changing if done well. seriously. i'm going to invest time into setting this up well (without sacrificing my daily outreach quota which i will continue to do manually until this system is up and running).

this "infrastructure" will make a huge difference imo.
outreach on this infra combined with regular, high quality content and meeting peeps in person is how this idea will blossom. i'm going to make it happen.
