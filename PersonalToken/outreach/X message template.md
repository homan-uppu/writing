i'd appreciate your feedback on an idea: a financial instrument ("personal token") that enables an individual to raise capital by selling equity in their future ownership of companies. (https://personaltoken.vc). 

personal tokens expand the reach of venture capital, enabling investing in individuals before they're ready to start a company, and also in those who will never start one, but will still go on to create great value. 

i'd love to know: 
1. would you invest in the personal tokens of bright, young, individuals you believe in?
2. what barriers / concerns would prevent you from doing so? 
(ofc would also appreciate any other feedback you may have). 

i'm working on this because i believe that in the age of AI, personal tokens are necessary to democratize opportunity. in a few years, selling equity in future outcomes (instead of taking on debt that most will not be able to repay) will become the most popular way for a young person to finance their learning. (why i believe this: http://personaltoken.vc/why).
