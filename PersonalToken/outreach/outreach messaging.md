the key question to answer: **will you invest in people through personal tokens?**

subject:
- requesting feedback on an idea: personal tokens

Hey Chris, fan of your thinking and long-time follower.

I'm working on a financial instrument ("personal token") that enables an individual to raise capital by selling equity in their _future_ ownership of companies. (https://personaltoken.vc).

Personal tokens expand the reach of venture capital, enabling investing in individuals *before* they're ready to start a company, and also in those who will never start one but will still create a lot of value joining great companies.

I'd love to know:
1. Would you invest in the personal tokens of bright, young, individuals you believe in?
2. What barriers or concerns would prevent you from participating?
(ofc would also appreciate any other feedback you may have).

I'm working on this because I believe that in the age of AI personal tokens will be necessary in order to democratize opportunity. In a few years, selling equity in future outcomes (instead of taking on debt that most will not be able to repay) will become the most popular way for a young person to finance their learning. ([why I believe this](https://personaltoken.vc/why)).

Thanks,

Hey Chris, fan of your thinking and long-time follower. 

(what it is)
- I'm working on a financial instrument ("personal token") that enables an individual to raise capital by selling equity in their _future_ ownership of companies (and other personal tokens).
- (more deets: https://personaltoken.vc).

(how it benefits investors)
- personal tokens enable investors to invest in individuals - indexing on everything they will create through their careers, instead of in specific ideas they may have.
- personal tokens expand the reach of venture capital, enabling investing in individuals *before* they're ready to start a company, and also in those who will never start one but will still create a lot of value joining great companies.

(ask)
- would you invest in the personal tokens of bright, young, individuals you believe in? would you want any changes in the contract? would greatly appreciate any feedback.

(why)
- I'm building this because I believe that raising capital through personal tokens will become the most popular way for most young people to finance their learning (as opposed to taking on debt) because paying for education will no longer make sense in the age of AI. ([why i believe this](https://personaltoken.vc/why)). personal tokens (or whatever they'll be called), will be a necessary tool to democratize opportunity.

(sign-off)
- thanks, homan.

Hey Chris, I'm exploring a new investment instrument called a personal token that represents an individual's ___.

Personal tokens enable you to __.

i'd appreciate your feedback on whether you'd be interested

I believe personal tokens (or whatever they'll be called) will be a core piece of infrastructure in the age of intelligence. I'm sure a lot of the details will change, but I can't see a way around venture capital financing learning for the majority of the world, which is what started me on this research.

I'd appreciate any feedback you may have.
