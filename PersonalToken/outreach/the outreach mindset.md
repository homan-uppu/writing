it's time for me to be fucking hyper social online.
and i mean HYPER.

i'm realizing that i need a significant, fundamental, mindset shift in order to "win" outreach.

tenets:
1. COMPLETELY IGNORE YOUR PAST. don't let your past failures / being old / whatever the fuck you're insecure about stop you from executing like a madman with nothing to lose. you must swing without baggage... completely engrossed in the present moment.
2. ENGAGE NATURALLY. there are many ways to engage online.
	- reply to great posts.
	- ask thoughtful questions.
	- DM someone about how they learned something.
	- DM great people and ask if they'd be interested in working together.
	- DM someone pitching PersonalToken and ask them if they're interested in investing in personal tokens.
3. GO HARD. i'm talking about raw volume here. reach out to many dozens of people each day. 
4. OFF THE CUFF. when you have a good thought in your mind, take a couple of hours to flesh it out and publish a longer post / essay (via Google docs) and just share it on platforms.

this is it. it's make or break. let's get it.
