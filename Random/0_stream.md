# Agenda
1. Big picture plan. Define the habits that define me. And, remember that things aren't as big of a deal as you make it out to be. Don't overthink things. Just act.
2.Pick a script idea. Flesh it out fully.
3. Truth seeking copilot design.

# Agenda
1. Read about how others deal with anxiety. To realize that you're not alone. At all. Dukkha is the default. Everyone is waging a war with their minds. Amen.
2. Big picture thinking.
3. Truth seeking copilot design.

You absolutely need to work out of this. Somehow. Amen brother.

# Don't rashly commit to something.
You had a sudden urge to register for a course that starts tomorrow.
There's no need for such hastiness. This is a long, long path.
Build up your home practice first - strong morning practice, OMAD, evening sit, and spend EVERY Sunday in a one day course. Amen.

# This is not a new problem
I've had it for as long as I can remember.
From the earliest childhood days.
School.
College.
Post college. VN (that large get-together), SF (Occidental).

It's in your mind.

Even when it seems to be "better", it's still there, deep inside your mind. Ready to explode at a moment's notice.

You need to learn to root it out at the depths of your mind.
Else, it will always haunt you. Always. In this life, or the next.

You have no choice but to master the mind.
That is the only thing that matters, if you think about it.

Need to completely root out unskillful habits. And build the right habits. This is the essence of the path.

# Just another thing to work through.
That's all it is. Just grind it out.
Be aware of sensations ALL the time.
Don't get caught off-guard. Amen.

# Maybe this is a blessing in disguise.
Seriously. It's pushing me to fix my health in a more holistic, long-term way by building habits that I'm going to sustain for life. Incredible.

I'm looking forward to these changes.

Find the positive in all of this.

# https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NgtYDP3ZtLJaM248W/sotw-be-specific -> solid read on how to effectively communicate.

# Priorities
1. Get momentum. There is no way around this.

# Ignore the past.
Completely.
Focus entirely on the present moment.

# Agenda
- Truth seeking copilot design.
- Write a script.

Be calm. Always focus on the action you're going to perform. Nothing else. Don't hold the burden of results. Amen.

# OK, bringing the mind back.
1. Dig into the copilot.

# Viggy's Obsidian folder
https://vigneshprasad.info - this is absolutely dope. Amen.

# Focus.
You have absolutely everything you need. It's time to focus and get the grind on. Amen brother.

And yes, I'm not going to bring my monitor here. This screen size is more than enough. I have absolutely everything I need to make magic happen.

# Fear.
I'm feeling it.
It's the start of something new, and there's naturally nervousness.
I think the right amount.
Stay grounded, see it through.

# Coming together
Use a concentrated mind to thoroughly explore this product space. I must build
in this space. I can't imagine doing anything else. Amen.

The daily, deep, meditation is going to help greatly. Amen.
And, in tandem, I'm going to be the healthiest I've ever been through my health plan.
Things are finally coming together! I'm feeling good, but not elated. I think I have more fear of fucking up more than anything. Lol.

# Office space chores
- Just take everything today and get it set up. Internet should also be set up by the end of the day. Amen.

# To consume:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujRwf1HdNjk. This looks like a solid video.

# Research next steps
1. Write your course for diet, exercise and supplements. Implement it tomorrow onwards.

# Agenda
- Diet and pelvic floor exercises research. Going to implement OMAD and that exercise regiment from today onwards.
- Explore a more narrow niche to create for.
- Script / start working on a landing paged. Amen.

By the end of the day today, I want a crystal clear, solid plan of action that I'm going to execute for at least the next year (and ideally for the rest of life).

# Solve your internal and health, and external will automatically happen.
- Absolutely. Need to build the energy up. Amen.

# Office set up chores
- Set up internet.
- Just start by moving over this big desk, your laptop stand, etc.
(Don't take over the monitor just yet. Grind a few days on your laptop and then decide whether you want to or not. Amen.)
- Welcome mat outside and in the back alley (to the bathroom).

And that's it. That's going to be the place of grinding for this phase. That's where things will take off. I believe it. Amen.

Just do your work, day in, day out.

# Schedule with the office
- Get there by 9am at the latest.
- Back home around 5:30pm. Yoga, another sit, dinner.
- Do the final sesh at home, prepare for the next day, pass out by 9:30pm (bec. need to be up by 4:30pm from day after tomorrow onwards.).

# There is incredible value in community.
And it's something that I'm missing out entirely.

# From this moment onwards, strictly only one meal a day.

Evening is the right time to eat for me. Skip everything from the morning till the evening.
This starts the day that I start using that office space.

No breaking this no matter what.
I suspect more than half of my problems stems from something physical.
I need to make this a top priority. My weight is currently out of control.
I also need to get blood work done.
Also: go get your Airtel number, and transfer some money into your account from your US account - use wise.com

# What happened to the get out of debt first direction? How are you going to pay G-bhai back by 2025?

# Maybe I need to volunteer a bit to feel useful?
Shit, I'm not sure what this is dude. Damn.

# Capital. Money. Damn son.
But you can't even create a damn video? Or write a single essay?
Why do I feel so... bogged down?
Have I ever felt this way before?
I feel like I've lost the drive to "build" for the sake of building.
I'm either growing OUT of my previous delusion.
Or falling into one that's harming me.

# Maybe it's time to do a job for a little bit.
Hmm... that's a fascinating thought. But I'm unemployable at the moment. Lol.

# There are no shortcuts.
Amen. Fascinating.

# Ground the mind in reality
When you focus on your sensations and realize that they are the only thing that's "real" in this moment, the mind is more easily balanced.

This is the only truth. Be grounded in Truth. Always.

Don't get carried away by your imagination.

# No more eating for the rest of the day - until 9:30am tomorrow. Amen.
I'm only having one meal a day from here no out. No iffs, no butts.
Amen.

I'm going to take my health back into my hands.

# Script writing process
That blank page is intimidating.

# Settling and mastering the mind is the way.
You will find the path when your mind settles.
Just continue to work on settling the mind.
Amen.

# No more random content consumption.
When I was reading Homo Deus yesterday I realized how enriching reading books can be, and how the average piece of content is absolutely GARBAGE when compared to a good book.

A good book is like a healthy meal.
Shorts / TikTok is like the worst kind of junk food. Limit it. Ideally, eliminate it.

# I need to kickstart some social life.
Damn. I haven't ever felt this isolated. There's something unhealthy about this isolation that I want to overcome.

Or, maybe this is what you must go through.

Just rely on the practice to overcome inner fears and anxieties. That's all you need. Amen.

# I need to get my life back on track. Seriously.
0. Daily 3 hour meditation practice.
1. One meal a day. (This is the only thing that will save my health).
2. Ashtanga vinyasa.
3. Creative momentum.

Damn, I feel so fucking fat. Like, unhealthy fat. This is bad.

# I have videos that I want to make
- What makes products great?
- How AI will actually increase the demand for programmers. (Or something to this effect. Or maybe even target "creatives").
- Those who control feeds, control the world.
- Incentives rule everything.
- The rise of the generalist ("full-stack") in all domains.

Yeah, and you can go on and on. That's not the point. The point is that there are things that I want to say. And that is a never-ending pipeline. I just have to focus on creating.

# Phew, that was a lot of exploration.
I do see some value in understanding the tools and effects before bringing something to life. Almost as a form of inspiration: by seeing what others have created, I get ideas for what to make myself.

But anyways, I'm convinced about building comfort in a video editing software and motion graphics software. I want to have a stack that I can easily create with. Amen.

Now, it's time to make a video!

# Picking and learning a video editing stack
There's no way around this, I want proficiency in a stack. Amen.

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_P-8nRbtOk
- Choose your stack:
    - FCP & AE
    - Davinci Resolve + fusion.

The ultimate stack is as follows:
- Video editor:
- Motion graphics:
- AI assets: Midjourney.
- AI effects: Runway.

And that's it. If you master this, you're set.

# Agenda
1. Brainstorm process (with eyes closed - train the mind's eye).

# By 2025 Jan.
- I want to have a product that has traction.
- I want a tiny team executing relentlessly.
- I want to have built brand momentum through content.
- I want to have a set of peers that I have a meaningful connection with.
- I want a public track record of incredible execution, no matter what the result is.
- I want to live in a home that I'm paying rent for.
- I want to be in the best health of my life. I want an undisturbed daily practice of meditation, yoga, and excellent diet (omad).

This is the foundational year to enable those outcomes. Amen.

# Process
Look, you're going to ship. Don't over-analyze. Don't worry too, too much about the future.

For each idea you're serious about exploring, write up a memo / design doc for it.

Be stupidly comprehensive. Poke as many holes as you can through it. Spend time designing the core interactions / experience so that you can visualize it in your mind's eye.

### Document the journey.

Publish weekly videos (and a written transcript / essay to go with it). Use this to hold yourself accountable and work on your communication skills. Oftentimes saying things out loud and communicating your thoughts helps you process them. Record yourself daily to build up the footage you need to hit the edit on Sunday - and publish that evening. I also like the thought of creating content that is aligned with the product / company that I'm building. That feels more powerful, and it's far more motivating to create with that intention.

### Personal dashboard
- Determine what you need to track every single day, and do it. Amen.

# Goals

This is it, it's quite simple and straightforward.

Personal:
- Be debt-free. Have 1 mil in the bank and one property under my name, so that for the rest of my life I don't have to think about how to afford bare minimum necessities. I never want to be in this position again.

Internal:
- Daily, unshakable, deep, meditation practice, Ashtanga yoga, and eating little (one meal a day, only until 60% full - leave room for water and air).

External:
- Build momentum in a product direction that is meaningful, and enables me to play at the intersection of product, content - and build the leverage I need to create.
    - The intersection is powerful. That's where I'm going to play. My mind is ripe for it.
- Build up my "network": meet and connect with like minded folks around the world. Have a set of peers that I can have meaningful, positive interactions with.

# Next steps
1. Think through product angles. The product needs to be something that solves a problem that I have.

And you need a WAY of doing this that is foolproof. Amen.

# Money problems.
What is the amount of money I need for financial freedom? 1 mil. That would be more than enough.

I would use this money to first buy a flat in Hyderabad - for the worst case scenario (in case all experiments fail, I need a fallback). Assuming monthly expenses of 10k, that would buy me 5 - 8 years of runway (more than enough, the remainder you invest).

This will enable me to live wherever I want in the world, and do whatever I want.

I cannot operate in this "no money" style any longer. Absolutely not.

The grind starts now brother. The grind absolutely starts now.

# OK, back to the top.

1. I've chosen the path to leverage my skills to build a product for the world. I will use content as a distribution channel for that product. Through this path, I will build leverage and collaborate with others to publish great work in other mediums (video, writing, etc.).

# Love this video style: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVTek-d8mv0
Feels so natural. Efficient. To the point. Minimal effects (bec. guess what! You don't need them!). Absolutely. There's no need to hide behind unnecessary effects - it won't make your video any better! Seriously.

# Commit. Commit hard. And execute. Amen.
Whatever I do, I want to make sure that I do it the right way this time. In a way that guarantees success. Amen. Let's get it.

Have the fundamental principles incredibly strong this time around.

# Ok, what are the paths available to me?
1. Bootstrap or raise? - they are fundamentally different paths.

It's really time to double down and do this. And to do it in the right way.

I'm not going to be learning any filmmaking vfx skills and stuff right now. I'm going to eventually build my studio and collaborate with incredible folks to bring that to life.

That's it. I've realized that I can't operate in a completely new, creative domain without first having some momentum and independence. Amen.

Yeah, I can't operate when there's constantly something inside of me telling me that I'm doing something irresponsible and wrong. That I'm shying away from my duty. Amen.

# My mind is so constrained because I'm viscerally feeling financial pressure.
Why don't you go make 100k and then start your creative journey? Or rather, do your creative journey alongside making money?

Or best yet: do Indie angles and use filmmaking as a means for distribution to practice the craft as you grow. Amen.

I'm not sure. I want to make art, but I don't feel like I have the financial freedom to do so.

I don't even know what I want to say, so how can I manifest nothing into reality?

I kind of don't want to do anything at the moment. If I had all the money in the world, I'd probably spend the entire year meditating, eating little, and doing Ashtanga Yoga.

That's all I'd do. I'd just go inwards. That's all I'd do.

I feel like I'm forcing myself right now to create, whereas in reality, I don't want to create anything. Damn.

At this moment, I don't feel the need to do anything in the world.
Absolutely nothing.

This is a weird feeling because I don't feel "low"... I just feel indifferent about anything external.

That being said, I am currently a burden (financially) on the people around me. And I need to change that. It's irresponsible for me to be such a burden. And: I can't go anywhere or do any purely creative act without first paying back what I owe.

Seriously. It's irresponsible to do anything else. Amen.

Then, why not double down on the domain that you know best. To leverage the knowledge you have, in order to create value in a way that will pull you out of this hole? Doing anything else is irresponsible. You simply don't have the bandwidth to do so.

When it's time to create videos, you ought to do that with leverage: i.e. hire writers, an editor, get the right equipment, and do it from the right space.

Amen.

Get this through your head! You are in fucking debt! Almost 10G in debt. That's a fucking lot!

I need a different plan. It's time to be responsible and snap out of this. Seriously.

# There's just so, so much you can do.
Seriously.
The possibilities are only constrained by your own imagination.
Seriously. That's all it is.
Get back to the brainstorming and writing.

# You can make absolutely spectacular stuff with Midjourney + Runway.
And you can even overlay whatever the fuck React components into them to create some super compelling stuff. Seriously.

# Nah, you're going to make videos. EVEN if that's about building product.
Such a frustrating experience, but this is all part of the process. Embrace it brother. Embrace it fully. Amen.

# I can't even think about making videos with this massive financial pressure looming over my head. Fuck.

# I'm going to flesh out a product angle today.
Yeah, just spend some time doing this. Damn.

# The discipline to write is everything.
Do you have the capacity to grind it out without absolutely any distractions? That's the crux of this path. Let's get it.

# There's no need to stick to a format.
A part of you is so fixed on the video essay format as popularized by Johnny Harris and the like.

That's a dangerous constraint that's stifling your creativity. You have to break free. Amen.

# Agenda
- Turn off the internet for the rest of the day.
- Fill up the Brainstorming.md.
- Complete a draft of some video.

That's it. Super simple. Just execute. Amen.

# Erdos. Incredible mathematician.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s

Described by his biographer, Paul Hoffman, as "probably the most eccentric mathematician in the world," Erdős spent most of his adult life living out of a suitcase.[19] Except for some years in the 1950s, when he was not allowed to enter the United States based on the accusation that he was a Communist sympathizer, his life was a continuous series of going from one meeting or seminar to another.[19] During his visits, Erdős expected his hosts to lodge him, feed him, and do his laundry, along with anything else he needed, as well as arrange for him to get to his next destination.[19]

On 20 September 1996, at the age of 83, he had a heart attack and died while attending a conference in Warsaw.[20] These circumstances were close to the way he wanted to die. He once said,

I want to be giving a lecture, finishing up an important proof on the blackboard, when someone in the audience shouts out, 'What about the general case?'. I'll turn to the audience and smile, 'I'll leave that to the next generation,' and then I'll keel over.[20]

# Write. Shoot. Edit.
It's really that simple.
That's all it comes down to.
And at this point, you have the fundamental muscle for all 3. Just have to put them together and put in the reps brother.

# If you can find the knack of prolifically writing scripts, everything takes care of itself.
There's a mental block you have right now with regards to storytelling, script writing.

Because I haven't trained my mind to do that yet, it wants to run away from that process and do something familiar: design and build software.

But I think I've found a process: close your eyes and trigger your imagination. WATCH the video you want to make before you even have the script. Try to visualize the scene in your mind's eye.

If you approach this script writing like coding, or traditional (non-visual) writing, then you're creating videos with a massive handicap. You know the kind of videos that process produces: there are plenty of them on the internet.

You have to train the visual imagination. That's what it is.

# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlbR5N6veqw -> Visual inspiration
I can definitely borrow some of that.

# Invest some time today on improving your workflow
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymrzLGA6UcU
The faster you are with editing, the more you'll want to edit.
Editing is the creation, as Kurosawa says
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DhC0QYij5I

# Deal with the pressure.
This is like the drownproofing exercise. If you panic and make a bad decision, you're not going to make progress.

Hold your cool. Your calm. Sit more. And make the right decisions. And see them through.

# On video style
I have to keep reminding myself that engaging videos don't have to be flashy. In fact, I think the opposite is true.

Flash oftentimes masks terrible storytelling.

It's entirely possible to create extremely engaging vidoes, with minimal to no special effects.

You just have to figure out the technique. That's all it comes down to. Minimal style, the right technique to create a compelling, engaging story.

# Nothing is great at marketing
Their YT channel is gold: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAi-iYeAAok. I dig the way Carl directly connects with the audience and customers.

He built an incredible content team that's honestly crushing it.

They already have half of the subscribers as OnePlus, and I'd bet their subscribers are far more engaged and loyal and will translate more to actually buying a Nothing product.

Another reason why I want to learn this skill. It goes hand in hand with product / company building.

# Lazy.so is incredible.
Probably one of the first times I filled out a Typeform to get access to a product because that's how badly I want it. Lol.

And I also like the patient approach they're taking to onboarding - the Superhuman approach.

Solve a simple problem that everyone has in the absolute best way possible. Damn. That's powerful.

# I don't have the mental space for a relationship
I honestly feel the stress of being in a hole in the ground.
It's annoying to be here. I have a strong aversion towards it.
And I want to climb out of it.
But at the same time, I don't want to rush it and make all the same mistakes I've made in the past.
I want to take the path to climb that's aligned with who and what I am, so that I can take that same path to ascend the mountain that's right next to this hole.
Climbing that mountain will absolutely require having the right path to do so.
The way I've framed it doesn't make sense because it implies that I can figure out the mountain path after I choose ANY path to climb out.

And actually, that's a reasonable interpretation.
Fascinating.

# As much as I love Zed, they need more business thinking
https://zed.dev/ -> A beautiful product, but damn, even the landing page pitch just feels like a bunch of engineers trying to write the best code rather than build a company that mints money. Wtf.

# The process
Initially, don't worry about the big picture of what brand you're going to build, or what content niche you're going to own. Just brainstorm what videos you'd want to see, pick one, and bring the script to life. Amen.

# There is ample money out there
There are so, so many angel investors ready to invest into promising companies. With a stellar product direction, compelling vision, proof of concept, and great communication, you should be able to raise if you need / want to.

It's just an option, of course, you don't have to take that option.

# I dig this single stream for everything.
It makes it super easy to sift through, organize all my notes, and process with AI when I need to.

In fact, this could be the foundation for a really interesting product.

From now on, take every single note in this single doc. Replace "Notes" with this.

Once you need to do some operations on it, create the system for it - the UI, AI processing, Q&A, CRM (for the people that you've noted), etc. That would be super useful.

# http://bennewhouse.com/ -> I'd want to work with him someday.
Strong product, and engineering background. Communicates well. Seems like a generally great all star teammate.

# My mind is settling.

The daily practice has made it easier to work with. It does what I want it to do. It's not as easily distracted. Concentration is strong. Body and mind are relaxed.

I also feel the mind become more creative as a byproduct of the calm concentration. Ideas keep coming to the mind. This is a good feeling.

Remember, nothing lasts. Nurture and cultivate this state of mind without attachment. It will go and come back as it pleases, not in your hands. All you can do is make the environment (internal and external) as ripe as you can for good ideas to come settle in your mind.

I want another meditation session at noon for an hour. I think it's necessary to keep rejuvenating the concentration as much as you can. Amen. That is your strongest weapon to achieve what you want. Amen.

# Agenda

1. Brainstorming videos I'd want to make.
2. Pick one and write the entire script for it, including title, description, etc.
3. Design session for knowledge consumption copilot. I think there's something interesting, and important, here to explore. Amen.
4. Design session for organizing knowledge: curated knowledge consumption that surfaces exactly the feed you want, when you want it.

# On brand building

https://cra.mr/you-suck-at-marketing -> great read on brand.
https://x.com/karrisaarinen/status/1750592508651016256?s=20

Brand is about standing for something, for creating awareness that you exist in the world, and are a viable option.

For every action you take, ask if it's "on brand" - does it align with what you stand for. Is it... "you"?

Consistency. Doing what you stand for day in and day out, and letting the world know compounds just like anything else.

Be known for what you stand for.
Be known to show up every single day and fight for what you stand for.
Amen.

For example, I think the Blueprint founder is great at building his brand. Every single thing he does and says is to further the Blueprint program.

That's powerful brand building.

# Maciej - a good designer
https://www.maciej.co/ -> seems quite competent.

# Studio space

I want to be able to afford a studio space.

I'm craving being able to have a quiet, clean, minimal studio space decked out with excellent tools to create with.

Ofc I have no excuses. The space I have now is more than good enough.

But I would like to work up to a space that I can design to the tee, in a quiet, secluded part of a bustling metropolis, with nature, but also a short walk away from civilization.

workspaces.xyz. Lol.

# Agenda

Stop overthinking and just create. I don't care how long you have this inner friction, I'm going to make you make you pick a video and force you to write the script for it tomorrow. That's it.

All you're going to do from here on out is write video scripts. That's it. You're going to exercise your imagination and your mind's eye.

You can't afford to not create. Just keep on writing video scripts. Just keep on writing until it becomes second nature. Amen.

# OK, back to figuring out what you want to say.

That's what this comes down to: figuring out what you want to say.

OK, let's figure this out.

There's no need to make your entire content roadmap pre-meditated. Just choose the next video you want to make, start the script and complete it! Only then should you choose whether you want to make it or not. Build this kind of discipline.

# This current sitting posture and situation is ergonomic.
The cheap ikea chair is at the perfect height for this table, forcing me to elongate my spine in order to have the right viewing angle, which is just perfect.

Stick to this setup from here on out. Amen.

# On storyboarding

I think it's helpful to add rough sketches of the shot composition as you write. I need to start stimulating the visual part of my brain. Amen.

# On writing

“I think young people today don’t know the trick of it. They start and want to get to the end right away. When you go mountain climbing, the first thing you’re told is not to look at the peak but to keep your eyes on the ground as you climb. You just keep climbing patiently one step at a time. If you keep looking at the top, you’ll get frustrated. I think writing is similar.”

“You need to get used to the task of writing. You must make an effort to learn to regard it not as something painful but as routine. But most people tend to give up halfway. I tell my AD’s that if they give up once, then that’ll be it, because that becomes habit, and they’ll give up as soon as it gets hard. I tell them to write all the way to the end no matter what, until they get to some sort of end."

- Kurosawa on writing.

I just saw https://www.fxfcourse.com/ - Nathaniel's video making course, and he breaks his process into 3 steps:
1. Writing.
2. Shooting.
3. Editing.

Almost all creators I respect start with the writing. Which makes sense, you need to have something worth saying before you can bring it to life. You need to represent your imagination in the most efficient form possible so that you can validate it on paper before you invest the massive amount of time and resources to bring it to life. Amen.

# On editing

Kurosawa edited his own work.

"Kurosawa often remarked that he shot a film simply in order to have material to edit, because the editing of a picture was the most important and creatively interesting part of the process for him" - this is such a profound perspective.

Filming is just about having material for the edit.

Amen.

"Kurosawa's habitual method was to edit a film daily, bit by bit, during production."
^ This is an interesting way to work.

I think I ought to do the same. For any video, as I have the material for the intro, I ought to complete it, edit it, and refine it until I move onto the next piece.

The intro is the most important piece, and if I don't nail that, no matter what I do after doesn't really matter. So I buy this process of editing as I get the material.

---

# Nothing else makes sense.
As I think about what I could possibly be doing, absolutely nothing else makes sense. I just want to make great videos as almost a therapeutic process to understand and express myself.

Yeah. I don't want to build a product. Maybe that feeling will come back to me eventually, but at this moment all I want to do is make videos.

Of course this process is going to be brutal. It's bound to be ridiculously difficult and painful and you're not going to enjoy the early days at all.

But for some reason, I feel like this is the path. I can't think of anything more fulfilling than this sort of creative expression. To be able to SAY something to the world, to finally be able to use my VOICE.

It's something that I havent' cultivated in a while, but it's finally time.

It's time to put myself out there and create.
It's time to make videos.

I like this clarity at least on the big picture.

# Rick Rubin wisdom

- Audience comes last. Audience wants the best thing they can get, and if you TRY to make it for them, your art gets watered down. Craving to serve someone undermines your work.
- If you've moved forward and the audience hasn't, it's an uncomfortable place to be. Lose authenticity by doing this. Or, be true to yourself and evolve, and in the process you might alienate your audience.
- Rules are there to establish average behavior, not something to aspire to. To create something special, you have to ignore rules, or go beyond the accepted norm for how it's done.
- Tunnel vision: losing perspective on the whole piece by being too tunnel visioned on the specifics.
- Limiting beliefs: when you find and stick to a format.
- Experiment.
- The more you engage in different creative practices, they ALL get better. Energy is what you might run out of, but not out of ideas or creative spirit - which is eternal.
- Never say you can't do, say that you can't do it YET.
- And it's not going to happen until you do the work. Think of it as a hobby, and let it come naturally. And there will come a time when you go "hmm... I think this batch is ready to share with people."

- When the stars line up, it just happens! You can't predict the outcomes. So much to it that we don't understand. All we can do is make something good, put it out and hope for the best.
- Tough to know WHY something works. Even if it works, you probably still don't know why.
- Lot of talented people don't make it because they don't have the work ethic to make it. The work ethic trumps the talent.
- Collaboration: when everyone is working together to make it the BEST thing possible, not just to get your ideas to win.
- What makes it great is the "personal": with all of its imperfections. How YOU see the world matters. And that's the purpose to art, to put YOUR voice out there.
- If not true to yourself, your work won't last.
- You can't second guess your own taste for what someone else is going to like. That's just not going to work. A bad way to play the game of art.
- Do what's personal to you. Take it as far as you can go. Really push the boundaries. And people will resonate if they're supposed to, but that's not up to you.
- Universe conspiring on your behalf if you let it.
- Catch the waves that anyone can catch if you're open to it, trying to catch it, see it coming, taking advantage of all the opportunities. And it isn't preconceived, it's through the doing that makes it happen.
- Do you have the best antenna to capture the energy for the best art?

Agenda:
- Brainstorm content niches. Choose one to start the journey on.
- Quality > quantity.
- On style.

Definitely need to think this through. Look, this isn't the time (yet) to build and ship a product. You must become a competent internet filmmaker. Absolutely. I'm not going to accept anything less. Why? Because it's the most powerful distribution channel. And because I believe I have a latent, powerful, yet uncultivated knack for it. Amen.

### Themes:
- Something about knowledge for sure. About being smarter and better at rising in this world. Better at avoiding stupid games. Building discernment. Building wisdom. Building competence. Gaining knowledge. And thriving in this world.
- Exploring what it means to change the world, and how to do it. Exploring extremely ambitious ideas.

Basically there are principles for how the world works that I believe would have been incredibly valuable for me to have picked up when I was younger. And even right now! I only have surface level understanding of most important concept, it would be useful learning for me as well to dig deep and create videos to help me learn, and then to share those learnings with the world.

Sort of like the "knowledge project", but not in the way the Farnam Street guy does it - which caters to the "intellectual elites" - college grads, 30 - 45 demographics, that have the appetite for raw interviews with two talking heads.

I don't think that format will scale. And catering to that audience alienates most of the younger audiences.

There's a potentially powerful intersection: Knowledge Project <> Dodford level quality presentation.

The presentation matters. A ton. The format has to be appealing to me. Presentation matters as much, if not more, than the content itself - it's what gets the reach.

This attachment to technology as a topic, is it necessary? What are the alternatives?

Well, here's the thing, in the same way ambition is required for companies, you need real ambition to even be able to see the creative paths worth taking here.

You have a blank canvas: a video can be absolutely anything. I think you should think really deeply about the format and style and topics, and even write a few scripts before you deep dive into a regular production.

This needs thought. Iterate and experiment in your mind's eye before producing. And when you create, make sure you bring it to the level of your vision, or as close as you can. This is how you actually learn.

Be thoughtful. Push the boundaries. Channel your deep, inner creativity and find a compelling angle, and a powerful vision behind this content creation path.

Till now, you expressed personal reasons for why. It's time to think bigger, and think about why this needs to exist in the firs place.

Assume you have the skill right now to create incredibly high quality videos to push forward ANY kind of message you want into the world.

Now, what is that message going to be? And why does that message interest you? Excite you? Why is that message so important and appealing that you'd be willing to give up your life for it.

In a sense, this underlying "why" is the foundation for any creative act - whether vidoes, products, music, or absolutely anything.

This is also what Bryan Johnson (the blueprint guy) is showing: a single idea, with a multi-pronged approach to getting that idea into the world (content, educational material, research, and eventually products).

Following a singularly focused approach like that is incredibly powerful. Not only from a reach point of view, but also from the perspective of living life with purpose.

A single theme, idea that you want to dedicate yourself towards.

Powerful.

What's that going to be?

You don't need it to be hyper focused and narrow at the start. You can narrow and even pivot if you need to.

But you need something that clicks with both sides of your mind.

OK, coming back to themes and what I'm going to create, let's start from the top again:

1. Technology: This is such a critical part of the world today. And it will only be more, and more relevant (exponentially increasing).

2. What makes us human: the human condition. We're all grappling with various forms of suffering, illnesses, insecurities, cravings, etc. This is what binds us as humans. One of the reasons I love films is that they help me connect with my emotional side, and become more aware of the human condition. When I feel Oh-daisu's desire for revenge, I feel my own. By putting myself in the shoes of those that I'm not helps me grow my understanding of the human condition, which is for some reason deeply fulfilling. If a work of art or product doesn't touch our emotional side, then we can't really connect with it. Similarly, I don't want to create or consume content that doesn't engage with the emotional part of my mind because it feels cold, robotic.

3. Entertainment: having that engaging "spark" that makes for addicting, entertaining content. You know, like the mass scenes you love in movies. Without that element, it turns into a kind of "learning" exercise, which I'm not a fan of. E.g. Even Johnny Harris videos can be a bore to consume. I want to create highly entertaining content.

4. Personal. I need to inject myself, my stories, my life experiences to be able to emotionally connect with others. People latch onto characters, and emotional bonding, and entertainment only come through that connection with characters. I need to be the "protagonist" in the vidoes, or find someone to be a protagonist. No "main character" means the audience has no one to live through, and their emotional mind won't connect.

OK, so I have an interesting foundation here:
Technology <> Emotion, and the human condition, suffering <> Entertainment <> Personal.

If you remove "Technology", there are so many

I don't want to give purely logical explanations, etc. without a protagonist, and without that emotional connection.

There's something special here. I want you to dig into this. There's a topic sphere, format, that is special, that you're uniquely positioned to create.

Think about it with your mind's eye. What are the possibilities here?



### Videos I'd really want to make.
- Incremental improvement: and why the waterfall approach to creating anything is fundamentally outdated. Using lessons from building software and applying to any creative endeavor.
- Exponential growth. / Compounding.
- Rise of the full-stack creator.
    - Better tools means that an individual can do so, so much more today than ever before in human history. And to walk through
- Why you shouldn't go to college.
    - A well researched, well balanced (acknowledge the reason to go at the end) take on why it makes sense to skip the formal education system entirely.

### On style:
- I don't want to copy the Johnny Harris nonsense effects and jazz that a lot of creators seem to be doing. I'm going to focus on extremely minimal, simple animations that communicate what I'm trying to say well. That's it.
    - I want my visuals to feel like: https://twitter.com/laurentdelrey, https://twitter.com/visualizevalue. There's a beautiful minimal aesthetic that I want to adopt for my own brand. Keep it minimal, to the point.


### On creation
I'm not a fan of how I've been creating till now: in a rushed way, without activating the flow state, without having a vision. Just creating for the sake of creating.

You only learn when you try to create your best work. Of course, I'm not saying take an entire year to make a video because you crave to "perfect" it. There's a balance of course, and trade-offs to make.

But you're not going to hone your craft if you only have a few hours to put out a quality video.

You're an absolute noob. You will only put out mediocre shit if you give yourself such a tight timeline.

Give yourself the breathing room to create the work that I know you can see in your mind's eye. That's the validation. The only thing you learn by putting out mediocre content is learning a few commands in Final Cut Pro, and the other tools you're using. That's it.

If you want to actually learn the craft of storytelling, you have to start by actually trying to effectively tell a story!

Don't start with long videos. Start with <60s shorts. For sure. I agree with that fully. But that short has to be as good as you can make it to communicate that topic.

You can take up to a week to ship a short in the early days and that's still OK because you're pushing the limits of your skill. Push what you can come up with, you can imagine, is where the real learning is.
