Till the end of 2023, publish something every single day.

What is this "thing" going to be? I'm leaning towards writing, but perhaps there are better mediums to optimize for? Nah, I'm going to stick to writing for this phase. It's what I most want to improve and refine. Writing is the foundation for any craft, so I want to get this right.

Take some time to think about the format. Lock it in, and immediately start working on the first piece to publish.

This is it! Let's get it brother. No backing down from this challenge. Just process everything faster.

### Format

Brainstorming:
1. A short (or long) essay, no word count goals, with a single image representing it, that looks good on the preview for that essay.
2. Entirely on Twitter... but this is more difficult to organize well, since there's no title. (https://twitter.com/culturaltutor) - it can work quite well. Hmm... But the image is critical. It adds some additional effort every day.

My problem with having it on Twitter is that the search-ability and organization suffer. I'd like people to just see titles that describe the essay, and they can just pick it.

OK, done: it's going to be on Substack, and I'm going to publish a post every single day, come what may. This is guaranteed.

Some thoughts on this challenge:
1. It's OK if the post is super short, and you're just quoting someone / something. That's fine. You're going to have those on some days. But at least try to add a bit of your own commentary to it. It's that process of formulating and expressing your thoughts and feelings that's important. You need to get that hit every day. Build the muscle brother. Build the muscle.
2. Momentum is everything. Climb out of this situation you're in with great habits that you build daily: writing, meditation, Ashtanga yoga, diet. Every single day. Build it.
