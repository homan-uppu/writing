Also going to stick to a ridiculously brutal diet from tomorrow onwards. Today will be a prep for this diet.

- 6 hardboiled eggs.
- Spinach.
- Tomatoes
- 2 Avocados.
- Light oil + salad dressing.
- A handful of nuts.

That's it. Every single day for 90 days. No exceptions: except perhaps the traditional, homemade Telugu food occasionally.

You need to have enough self control to be able to do this for 90 days. That's not that long! Seriously. Muster up the will and make it fucking happen.

Diet has historically been the most difficult thing for me.

Just renounce everything. Don't listen to the body's cravings. Just sit with it.
