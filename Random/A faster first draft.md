A time-boxed session in which I literally just dump. I currently suck at this because I edit while I write.

I justify this behavior by saying that I need to think things through. But I'm saying: just fucking dump the first thought that comes to your mind with the understanding that if it sucks I'm going to cut it / evolve it later.

That speed helps because editing is where the creation happens. The sooner you can get there, the better.
