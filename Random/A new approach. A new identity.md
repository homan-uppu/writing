3 months is more than enough to create such a powerful momentum that you can gain support from the world to keep working on your direction.

**But, it requires you do things a bit differently:**
1. Share a lot more that comes to your mind. Use Twitter as a stream of consciousness to share your thinking with whoever will listen.
2. Connect & get feedback from a lot more people. **Create the opportunity for serendipity.**
3. Be unapologetically bold. Fly forward no matter what the world thinks about you. Train the mind to be fixed on the present moment as you pursue this path. Absolutely.

If you do this well. And if you're open enough, you will attract support. Amen.

Be fucking genuine. Authentic. Be you. And don't apologize for it. Done.

And, do it on your name. It doesn't matter what your friends or anyone thinks. Just keep publishing. Seriously.

If you don't get over your... shyness (for lack of better word), you're going to be in an absolutely shit position by the end of the year - which you can't afford. Amen.

Think less, do more.
