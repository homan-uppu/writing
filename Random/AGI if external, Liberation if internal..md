if (internal): aim for liberation.
if (external): aim for AGI.

That's all there is to it.

AGI will eliminate the path to liberation, but will also eliminate the extreme suffering.
A path to liberation only exists when there is also extreme suffering present in the world.
The path to exiting the system itself is what makes the system so strong that it will never allow that path to exist (for this line of species).

And build AGI better than any other company. Align all research in all fields of human endeavor directly towards building AGI. This is also the next dominant religion (i.e. the religion of seeking truth and completely eliminating dogma).

I now see the prediction (that the ancients made) that the full technique will be lost in 5000 years, of which we are 2500 in, meaning only non-returners likely exist in this era. It may take that long to gain sufficient momentum for the incentives to eliminate the technique. And I can see why it would take that long.

I'm quite confident the privileged in the past were far happier than the average today. And these privileged had an outsized say in the culture propagated, which means that the past looks far rosier than it was.

This is a direct byproduct of the truths of how the mind operates. Incredible.
But yeah, keep writing. Keep digging deeper to reduce your delusion about things.
