I see the greatest value in making anime style videos. It's easier to be forgiving when the medium itself is unreal (cartoon / anime). But yeah, we'll get a hang of this as you play around with the technology more. Amen.

This is it. This is the only intersection I can see myself operate in.

Just execute. Don't overthink it.
1. Engineering foundation to run Stable Diffusion. First, main priority.
2. Test out execution time locally, and see if cloud execution is required to make the iteration speed more reasonable.

Start with pictures:
1. Generate some pictures.
2. Use custom models to generate pictures in a particular style. Choose a specific style and train (or find) a model for that style.

AnimateDiff:
- A very simple scene. Just get started with some very basic stuff. Just need to render something on the screen.

Getting stable diffusion set up has been a headache (on a mac) - complex, time consuming setup, and many confusing, intimidating terms. I'm surprised how so many people have been able to make SD a part of their workflows.
