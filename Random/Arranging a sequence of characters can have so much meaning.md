This is a powerful thought.

What I'm realizing is that my main task is simply to think well, and communicate well. And others (AI, humans) will execute.

Good ideas & communicating them IS execution, contrary to popular belief that ideas and execution are somehow mutually exclusive.

So... this is all I need to do. Day in day out. Come up with great ideas and communicate them to others. That's all there's to do. Amen.
