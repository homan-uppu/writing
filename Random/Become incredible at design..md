Just have fun with it. I know you will. Amen. Make each piece a work of art. It can be minimal, and constrained, but it better be well designed. Amen. Express your taste. Amen.

And, start reading about design. Create your feed such that you become great at this. Amen.

"Your screen is my canvas."
"Designing is how I think through"
"Striving for the beginner's mind."
