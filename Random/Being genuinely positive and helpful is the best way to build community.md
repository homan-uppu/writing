Take the time out every single day to engage with people and projects you respect. Especially if they're younger / just starting out.

Just try to offer as much help as possible, as a way to give back to the community.

Participating in a genuine way is the only way to thrive.

Don't let your ego get in the way. The more you separate your sense of self-worth from your "work", the less influence your ego has over the way you participate in the community.

This is an important shift I have to make in the way I approach creating online. Amen. It's important, and it must be done.
