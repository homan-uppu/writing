Starting the day with a braindump of what I'm feeling and what the next steps are. I think it's important to have a regular big picture thinking session so that I don't get lost in the weeds and have a sense of purpose in my work. Amen.

Firstly, I'm quite excited about the audio notes app. Before any further development on the app, I'm going to use it prolifically to create and publish my work. You have to be patient. You can't rush product development without first putting the product to the test. 

Is it actually valuable or is it something that you desperately WANT to be valuable? That's a key question that needs to be answered with usage.

It's time to think through the content that I'm going to create, because this is what will give purpose to the tool that I'm creating - because it needs to have something to feed into. OK, great.

I also want to spend some time thinking about the purpose / meaning of this app and how I want it to serve humanity. Amen.

I just want this app to help me express my natural self. That's literally all I want it to do. To help me fight my own self-censoring tendencies. To help me be me. Actually, do all of this thinking in the app itself. Amen.
