Next essays:
- Rewarding curation.
	- Curated knowledge is super important.
- Creativity is eating the world: outline all of the consequence of a high creativity world.
	- Education
	- Organizational structure
	- Mindset
	- Tougher to maintain mental health: envy, being overwhelmed, algorithmic publishing schedules.
- How to master a creative skill. (Shu ha ri + wisdom learned from creatives like Mr. Beast, top designers, engineers, founders, Naval).
	- Learn by doing. Iterating until you can make outcomes you're proud of.
- How well can AI teach?
- How to job hunt.
- The skills that matter.

Freeze these and definitely knock them out. The titles may end up being different, but the topics won't.

I need tos

Come back home with reasonable brain dump / first drafts of each. During evening sesh, I'm going to pick one essay and do a complete first draft - a ruthless brain dump.

It's coming together. The angles are arising, and supporting each other. Powerful.

And I want to make the upcoming essays smaller. Tightly packaged thoughts. Unless absolutely required to expand (like for the proof of competence).

- **Why college is outdated**.
- **Creativity is eating the world**. (might have to narrow this a bit, but basically study all of the consequences of a more creative, highly leveraged world - across domains. Particularly for startups).
	- More bootstrapped, smaller startups.
- **Build proof of competence** (essentially a condensed playbook for how to get hired in Tech).
- **The skills that matter** (what are the skills to train in this new world).
- **AI copilots** / **How well can AI teach?**
	- How well can AI teach? (will require defining what teaching is and why it can look quite different for creative skills).
	- Algorithm vs. Artistry (reference Hassan here - was such a great point).
- **Investing in individuals** - exploring how this would shift the underlying business model of education, and the world. But, how would you even implement this. Study friend.tech, and securities laws (why they exist and how we can hope to retain the essence of those laws, without stifling regulation).
- **Rewarding curation**.

After publishing the 7th essay, I'll make a call on what the next steps are. I should hopefully be in a position to work on a product. But we'll see what path arises. Don't have rigid expectations. Amen.

By the end of this process, you will have a long-term angle with strong conviction. I can guarantee that. And you'll be able to write: "What I'm going to work on for the rest of my life." - as a "search query" to attract like minded individuals. I want to start some sort of a "club" / organization that has a crystal clear charter and long-term mission. I want to attract incredible minds to work with on the most important / promising direction I can think of.

No more short-term nonsense. I'm going to be brutally, unapologetically ambitious. And I don't mind not having much money (just enough for basic needs). Amen.

Writing is the path.

Really analyze the challenges with learning, which means you need to understand the state of the world itself. There's no other path. There's no other way to build. Wow.

Writing and thinking things through is a powerful way to learn. And I'm sure as you get feedback and engage in useful discussions, you'll learn more.

This is an exciting problem to tackle. What is the magical assistant which when paired with someone will expose them to the right knowledge, in the right way. Powerful.

There are some really interesting ideas here to explore. Powerful. Keep writing - this is the process to understand, explore, and share ideas. It's going to take time, but I'm definitely going to get there. Amen.

These essays could be the foundation to start an informal club around working on the learning system. That would be incredible. Attract like minded, competent individuals looking to radically redefine education. Hmm...

Focus on this big picture. Lean into it.
