It's coming together. The angles are arising, and supporting each other. Powerful.

- Why college is outdated.
- Why creativity is eating the world.
- Rewarding curation.
- AI copilots (i.e. the learning ecosystems: tool becomes the teacher).
- Build proof of competence (this heavily references the creativity essay - for creative skills the way you demonstrate competence is through proof, not a credential).
- Job hunting playbook packaged in a more effective way as a series.

By the end of this process, you will have a long-term angle with strong conviction. I can guarantee that. And you'll be able to write: "What I'm going to work on for the rest of my life." - as a "search query" to attract like minded individuals. I want to start some sort of a "club" / organization that has a crystal clear charter and long-term mission. I want to attract incredible minds to work with on the most important / promising direction I can think of.

No more short-term nonsense. I'm going to be brutally, unapologetically ambitious. And I don't mind not having much money (just enough for basic needs). Amen.

Writing is the path.

Really analyze the challenges with learning, which means you need to understand the state of the world itself. There's no other path. There's no other way to build. Wow.

Writing and thinking things through is a powerful way to learn. And I'm sure as you get feedback and engage in useful discussions, you'll learn more.

This is an exciting problem to tackle. What is the magical assistant which when paired with someone will expose them to the right knowledge, in the right way. Powerful.

There are some really interesting ideas here to explore. Powerful. Keep writing - this is the process to understand, explore, and share ideas. It's going to take time, but I'm definitely going to get there. Amen.

These essays could be the foundation to start an informal club around working on the learning system. That would be incredible. Attract like minded, competent individuals looking to radically redefine education. Hmm...

Focus on this big picture. Lean into it.
