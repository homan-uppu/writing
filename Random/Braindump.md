Ashtanga, minimal food (And I think you overestimate what minimal is - you can go a lot less than you think), meditation to ground the mind.

No financial burden looming over my head - this may be a factor in crippling the state of my mind.

You're not going to break the lease. You're not going to run away from this situation. You're simply not going to. I'm not going to let you.

This is the same feeling you feel towards the middle of a long run: you don't want to keep going, but you have to. You have to grind through this phase with great strength. You have to build the muscle to see things through. Amen. 7 essays, and then build a product. The path is clear. It's tough, but at least it's clear. Don't deviate from this whatsoever. See it through. The ability to get through this phase is what separates the best from the rest - irrespective of the domain.

For difficult writing sessions - work in public, or, if at home, work **entirely analog**. Anything else is especially dangerous.

Simple concise explanations are the best. I think it's OK to sacrifice some nuance for the sake of simplicity so that it's easier to understand and engage with. In this sense, Twitter is a great way to practice this skill.

Even after I start building, I plan to publish an essay every single week. The essay won't be long. But it will have a nugget of my thinking about something I find meaningful. The only way to get good at something is to keep practicing. That's the only path / option you have. Just keep at it.

The thought of going back to India is repulsive. That's simply not the right environment. Absolutely not. If I can't do it here, I can't do it anywhere. Running away from your environment won't change anything. In fact, it will make your problems worse because you're feeding the mental reaction that you need to resist acting on - in order to overcome it.

I can't run away from this situation. I have to embrace it. This process, and the challenging nature of this phase, are teaching me the gap between my current competence, and where I need to be in order to generate the outcomes that I want.

Another thought on India: the urban Indian environment is just not my place. It's the worst of both worlds: westernization without the freedom and curiosity. Remote India is the only space that would work - but ofc that's incredibly difficult to set up. I'm going to be in the Bay Area. There's nowhere else I'd rather be. That's the honest truth of this moment. Actually there is: Arunachalam. That place is incredible. But still, even then, I wouldn't want to be there.

Remote California sounds tempting, but that isolation might be tough - especially during this phase. But you have to confront that isolation sooner or later. Nah, remote CA doesn't sound good actually, because it means I'm running away. Where I am right now feels incredible. Remember: this is about the mind, not the environment. You need to build the mind up in this environment. This is the challenge you've put yourself in. Now, see it through.

The kind of future I want to build:
- A part of a meaningful community.
- Traveling around the world: spending a couple of months in various cities, countries, and cultures. I'd especially love to work with younger people who are eager to learn something that I could teach. That **feels like it'd be quite fulfilling**.
- I want to teach. **I want to uncover and distill knowledge incredibly well - so that people can benefit from it.** Spreading a useful body of knowledge to the world.

Systemize and spread a body of knowledge that is incredibly relevant for this high creativity world. There's so much to research, think through, and distill here. Powerful.

**What's that body of knowledge, and way to communicate that knowledge, that will unlock the human potential?**

This is the fundamental question I'm looking to answer through my work. And possibly, through my life.

This question is so broad, that the only way I can approach it is by tackling it in one tiny chunk at a time. Over time, as I uncover these chunks, I can put them together to present a more holistic answer to this question.

Every step I take needs to be towards answering this question. I'm sold on that.

And the world definitely needs this body of work. I'm 100% convinced about that.

What is the path I'm going to take to answer this question?
- Thinking, researching small chunks of it and writing about it - this would be the first step.
- Building tools to help some part of this process.

And then following the Truth that comes from this process.

That's it. Quite straightforward.

Back to the angle: 7 essays, and then think deeply for a week about what you're going to build, and why. And then attack it. By this point, I want to be significantly more competent at writing: at communicating my ideas. That's a critical muscle that I need to be able to answer this question, and hence it's the first muscle I'm going to develop.

Just keep at it. Follow your gut. And execute hard.
