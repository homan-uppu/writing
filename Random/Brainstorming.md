1. Writing copilot (-> general feedback engine)

Writing copilot is challenging because I'm not sure if I'd be a user. Hmm... that's interesting.

I'd only be a user if it actually, tangibly, helped me with writing. If the feedback is mediocre, why would I use it?

Then the game is all about making the feedback excellent. Absolutely. And that should be possible no? Perhaps.

This is an important problem to tackle. The world needs an incredible writing copilot to help them become better writers - the most powerful skill to have.

I would def target overseas: i.e. Indian, Nigerian, Vietnamese, Japanese engineers. That would be powerful. Amen.

In a sense, this is a challenge to gather the necessary training data.

There's also an interesting problem here re. people letting the AI be their "voice". Hmm...

Let's get the sesh at home. Hmm..
