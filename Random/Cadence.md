Need to pick this up.

Reduce the number of decisions you make. Once you've decided one post a day, just double down on it. Don't revisit this decision for 120 days. After that, you can decide what needs to be done.

But, I have a problem with this. Primarily - it's turning out to be an excuse to not push for extremely high quality. And it's only the high quality work that will move the needle for yourself.

That makes sense.
