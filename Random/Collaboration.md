After publishing the first set of videos (once you've published one that you're proud of), systematically build your network in this space.

And it's a continuous process: the better you get, the more you should reach out and collaborate.

Become deeply embedded into the community. Participate where the community exists: online and offline. Build relationships with creators that you deeply respect.

And that's it. Continue to create and build relationships. That's all.
