**Process**:
1. Make all the points you want to make in each section.
2. Get the transitions right
3. Line level / para level analysis. Cut all unnecessary things. Simplify language. Active voice over passive voice. Etc.

**Intro**
- Give the gist of the entire essay here: 
	- A world with a higher bar for creativity operates with a radically different set of rules. It's a fundamentally different world that we can't just slap on our outdated ways of thinking in hopes that it will translate to this world.
	- Share the most powerful conclusions you've come to, and set up the rest of the essay as a means to support and explain those conclusions.

**Bar for creativity is rising**:
- Need to clearly define what I mean by creativity before throwing around the term.
- Give a specific example of how the bar for creativity rises as technology gets more powerful.
	- Use data entry as an example.
- Un-regulated & pixels will evolve a lot faster than atoms & regulated.
- Apply the right transition to the next section:
	- "So what, colleges simply have to update their curriculum to be able to train for this higher bar of creativity. Unfortunately, the underlying business model of colleges, or really any pay-to-learn educational system breaks down as the bar for creativity for a skill rises beyond a certain point".
- (Reference the firing: https://nypost.com/2023/07/13/dukaan-ceo-fires-90-of-support-staff-in-favor-of-ai-chatbot/).

**Features of creative domains**
- Need to tie up all the features in a single paragraph and make the resounding conclusion: that colleges, or any pay-to-learn model can't reach the massive audience that we need high quality education to reach.

**Software engineering as a case study**

**Why colleges can't adapt**

**What's next**

**Concluding thoughts**
- Exponential change (this can actually go in the "Conclusion" section - when you address the counter that I'm being too alarmist).
