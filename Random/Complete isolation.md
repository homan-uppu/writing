To produce the work I want to produce, complete disconnection might help.

To give yourself the space to process, to build the discipline, and mastery.

Turn it all off. From tomorrow onwards - only rear your head when you have something to publish (or you absolutely have to do some research to complete the essay). You need to disconnect more than you think.

It's monk mode time.

The internet has been a massive distraction ngl. I think it's been more harmful than helpful.
