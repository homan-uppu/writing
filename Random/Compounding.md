**Lean into things for the long-run**. That's what you ought to focus on. The long-run. Remember the compounding impact of everything you do. Writing. Building. Relationships. Diet. Meditation. Every single thing you do is benefitted by long-term compounding.

Stick to things and you'll figure it out. Amen.
