It needs to both engage your rational mind: i.e. it must lead to a worthwhile impact.
And it needs to engage your creative mind: i.e. it needs to be something that you feel the pull to do naturally.

The combination is deadly. One without the other means that you can't have cohesiveness: your two selves will always be **at friction** with each other, freezing you in your tracks (which you're quite familiar with).

The angle needs to be right. It needs to be ambitious to make it worthwhile for your rational mind. Communicate it with such clarity that you can't help but be inspired by your own words and clarity. The first person to communicate for is yourself: to convince the various parts of your own mind that this is worth doing and that this path has a chance of working out.

**And then attack it.**

But no matter the angle, the first form to represent it is in writing. And that's the beauty of the technology of language: it's the cheapest, fastest way to represent any creation, in any medium. Language is power.

Which is actually why you're writing in the first place: to sculpt that compelling angle that pulls you with such force that you feel as if you were on a ride, surrendering any illusion of control. Surrendering to a higher power flowing through, and vibrating in, every atom of your existence. Powerful.

And, if you need to (it definitely might come to this), you should start looking for some honest ways to make a living so that you can sustain this creative effort - which isn't clear when it will pan out.

By honest, it could also be clever ways to make money, but my concern with that is: there are no shortcuts to making money, any money making game you play comes with the need to put more attention in it than you'd want to.

Some sort of menial labor / menial programming / menial writing (actually never pollute your writing by selling it to others. You should never write / build something that you wouldn't want to if someone weren't paying you for it).

Therefore:
