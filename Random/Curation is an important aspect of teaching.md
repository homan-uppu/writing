For example: if someone wants to learn a skill, I should be able to share with them:
1. (Static) A list of content to consume, and the order in which to do so.
2. (Dynamic) A content feed from a curated list of creators that I know are great at this skill. Is updated to be fresh.

----

**Track a creator's content across platforms and add to the feed**. Chronology is not important, quality is: the feed could show me old content, and that would be fine as well, as long as that content is great.

I mean, this is basically Twitter, but the primary difference is in the feed: how that content is surfaced, and what's shown with it.

I actually see great value in just building this for myself. Expose yourself to better content - that isn't tied to the current feeds (i.e. not hyper optimized for "now", but rather, hopefully, timeless content). There's great wisdom in human history, and I think it's important for us to be able to easily access that knowledge in a way that's easy to consume.

Steal the brilliant consumption user experience from social platforms, but swap out the content.

That's a solid experiment.

Think more deeply about this. Amen.
