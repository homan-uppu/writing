I need to carve out 30 mins a day to read about Yoga. I want to be more serious about the theory. It's important that I craft my entire life around the practice. It's important for me to be more adept at this.

This is fundamentally the skill that will enable the physical skill that I need to enable my higher pursuits. The body is an important vehicle. An instrument that I must use to evolve. I can't ignore it. I must embrace it. Understand it.

So yes. Every day I ought to spend some time digging into Ashtanga theory and Hatha Yoga Pradipika. Amen. And any doubts - ask Gururaja. He has the experience to be able to help out. Absolutely.

As you read, take notes and record your questions that you can then ask.
