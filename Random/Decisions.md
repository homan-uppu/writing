I'm going to work in the realm of **enabling / enhancing self-expression**.

**Why**
1. In an age of **infinite leverage**, having the ability to express yourself well is a powerful skill - perhaps the highest leverage skill. You need to communicate your ideas well in order for AI to bring it to life. This is the key skill to train for, and to enable.

**What I don't want to do:**
1. Do some kind of **B2B sales-ish angle**. That might be an eventual outcome (like Notion), but that can't be my starting point. I want to build for an individual, and then see if an b2b angle even exists later. In fact, I'd rather join a company doing this than to do a b2b angle on my own. That's just not where I want to be spending my time. It's not worth it.

Which means, whatever I choose to work on should be something I can leverage to land a role at Midjourney. That would be the goal.
