I'm pleasantly surprised by the quality of the transcript. **It's rough** in that it has a bunch of words and fillers, etc. that don't need to be there, but damn it's my raw stream of consciousness that I didn't backspace the crap out of while I created it.

The raw, unfiltered, unedited seed is an important first step. Without it you can't create great work because your anxiety about how you'll be perceived will warp that seed before it has the chance to grow its root.

I'm excited for what this will lead to. I'm feeling quite good about this process. I have a good feeling about this.
