Dictate all your thoughts on the topic (as if you were in an interview about it). - Sit on the floor in a meditative position, and record into your smartphone... ideally into your airpods so that you can keep your hands free.

You're basically going to meditate on the topic. Let it flow out and keep going until you've exhausted all your thinking on the topic.

It's OK if you contradict yourself, or if change your mind in the middle, or whatever - you just want to be in a free mental space with no backspace.

While you dictate, try to use your mind's eye to visualize what you're talking about. If any important visuals come to your mind, then talk about them as well (as a prompt to a system that would draw it for you).

I have a feeling this will work really fucking well.  Wow.
