This is my motto from here on out.

I'm not passionate about it, I'm dispassionate.

I'm not going to waste energy getting emotionally aroused or invested in what I'm building. Treat it as your duty, and carry out your responsibilities with dispassion.

Simply focus on creating value. Done.

This is actually a revelation.

I feel so much more free. Wow. Is this what freedom feels like? Freedom from your own self-image is the greatest freedom of them all. This is incredible.

Amen.

Suicide: not of the physical kind, but the kind in which you kill your self-image. You have no image. Just be.

The craving for a certain image has always held you back. Greatly. It's time to finally overcome that.
