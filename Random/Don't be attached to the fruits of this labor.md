There is no timeline. You must go down this path to keep crafting the angle. It's very difficult to see past the next step. In fact, it's impossible. Every time you get attached to a specific next step, you become biased. Fascinating.

I sense attachment in my mind right now. I haven't let go of specific outcomes, and naturally I'm biased towards those outcomes.

At least I acknowledge it. Craving outcomes is such a deeply rooted habit of the mind that is quite difficult to reverse. Naturally, the only thing I can do is practice.

Doesn't help much, I know, but this is the path.

And yes, the path is as narrow as the blade's edge. Excruciatingly difficult. Yet, I have no option but to walk it. No choice in the matter. If there is a way to reduce delusion, how can one not follow that path if not for bad habits that pull them away from it?

Fascinating.
