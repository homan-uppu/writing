I know you want to be throwing events for many people, etc. But don't rush it.
Do it when the time is right. After you've built a bit of brand and put your voice into the world.

Everything takes time and patience. Amen.

Earn your right to transition full time into content. Build good products first. This is your jam. Amen.

Do this really fucking well. Ship. A lot. Use this as the foundation.

Build for yourself. And build really, really well (to the quality that you need it at in order to use it).

And master SwiftUI: get really fucking fast using it, coupled with a solid back-end in Nextjs. This combo, **combined with solid design chops is the way to go.**

1. Build.
2. Collaborate.
3. Create content.
4. Build community.

These are the steps. Don't try rushing things. Build momentum (and your habits) slowly such that they will last. Amen.

Can't think of anything else at the moment. Let's get to work! Amen.
