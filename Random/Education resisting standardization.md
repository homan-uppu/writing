I get what it means for hiring, but I'm unable to define it for the learning process itself.

Standardization is education that optimizes for standardized tests that everyone takes - often multiple choice 

Standardized education is one with the **same curriculum for everyone**, with everyone taking the same standardized tests, with a standard timeline (e.g. 3 - 6 years) for the education that applies to all students.
