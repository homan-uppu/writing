- Coming back to education: standardized education doesn't work for creative skills because you can't say with confidence whether someone with an education in that creative skill can actually make a living doing it after graduating.
- Therefore, in creative domains, the transactional educational business model in which we pay an upfront “tuition” (and often take out a loan to do so) in exchange for an education that we hope will enable us to build a career no longer works.

- ISAs might seem different than the traditional exchange tuition for education, but it's basically the same thing: it shifts the risk from the student to the institute, but if the underlying economics doesn't work out, the institute will find it very difficult to sustain itself, let alone thrive.

- As a result, the Tech industry has found itself in an interesting situation: It says it operates a certain way (according to the state of the world with a much lower bar for creativity), while operating according to a much higher bar for creativity.

- It's sad and funny that every few months a post by a software engineer will go viral claiming that the software engineering interview is broken. They're right, it is! But I haven't heard of any good, economically feasible alternative because creative skills resist standardized evaluation. If it was a problem that could be fixed with a better standardized assessment, it would have been by now.

**Case studies of lack of competence in new grads**:
- My cousin graduated with a computer science degree from a second tier US college in 2019. He was far from being able to pass a technical interview at most companies, and his lack of a brand name education made it nearly impossible to hear back from companies, let alone get an interview. He spent almost a year simultaneously practicing interview problems, building projects and his pitch, and ruthlessly executing a cold emailing strategy + getting introductions through friends that finally landed him a handful of interviews, out of which he received 2 offers.
- My family friend who's currently in his 2nd year of college in Hyderabad, in quite a reputed college (not an IIT, but a popular private university in Hyderabad) is learning some arcane Java. They memorize definitions of programming concepts and regurgitate it during exams. He hasn't learned anything worthwhile in college from what I can tell, except for the natural social maturation that comes at that age from engaging with many peers.

More consequences of rising bar for creativity: hierarchical organization structure makes no sense, especially when you associate value with seniority. That's completely outdated.

**Thoughts on why elite institutions produce talent**:
- Even for the colleges that seem to produce great talent, it isn't clear how much they actually contributed to the talent, and how much the talent is a consequence of grouping together highly ambitious students through an artificially scarce admissions process.
- Just because a person landed a job after college, doesn't mean the college program is what enabled them to do so. They could be getting jobs despite their college education, yet the college takes the entire credit for it.
- Most graduates need to get a job in order to survive. No matter how much, or little, support their college provides, if there's a way to get a job, they will find a way to get it through various efforts. The student's back is against the wall, a do or die situation, and they'll fight to land jobs. And when they get the job, largely through their own efforts, their college takes the credit.
- In addition to this, companies often take the burden of training and education while paying the employee. They do this because they simply can't find enough competent people to hire. And so they're forced to hire untrained new grads and train them.
