1. **Title**. A succinct title that encapsulates the idea I want to communicate, really well. And then 
2. **Caption**. Communicate the main point in one sentence. Think of this as a tweet that encompasses your entire point.
3. **Image**. I want a stellar image for each essay that captures its essence. I want my own style for all the images I create.
4. **Write**. Iterate on drafts. Feel free to change title / caption if more compelling angle presents itself.

One week max to write and publish an essay. And ideally you only take 2 - 3 days to do so. By end of the first, and max 2nd day, you should have a reasonable draft of the essay you want to publish. This is the pace you need to meet your cadence goals.
