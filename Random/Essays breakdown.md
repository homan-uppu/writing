- Most knowledge is hidden. (the draft of this *will* be done today - come what may).
- The skills that matter.
- Evolution of knowledge work (or just engineering). - *actually yeah, focus this on software engineering, but in the concluding thoughts, talk about how this generalizes to all of knowledge work.*
- Why college is outdated.

*This is a great exercise: position each essay as narrowly as you possibly can. Tight. Concise.*

Breaking down the "Why college is outdated angle":
- Why college is outdated (this is actually the right essay, you just have to write it very differently, and more tightly scoped).
- Being able to invest in individuals. (find a better title, but basically, need to explore this idea in a succinct way).
- Creativity is eating the world (a quick observation on how the world is changing )
- Evolution of knowledge work (or software engineering).
- Why hiring is opaque.
