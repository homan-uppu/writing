- Definitely one more full hour sit. Absolutely.
- Do another stream - for sure.

- Shorter workout at 6:40pm, followed by a walk / run to get some food? Or, actually, just come back home and have hardboiled eggs. That's the way to go.
- Tomorrow morning - do Ashtanga the first thing in the morning, every single day. Start the day with Ashtanga and meditation. And stick to that routine. There are just some things that you need to do in order to start your day well. And mornings are definitely when you ought to do them. Absolutely.

Actually, this eve - yeah, just don't eat much. Drink as much water as you can. That's it. Amen. Spend time more wisely. Amen.
