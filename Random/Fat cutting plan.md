### Goals
1. Reverse metabolic syndrome. This is critical to regain health.
2. Cut body fat down to 15%. It's far too high right now.
3. Get to 180 lbs. This ought to be my **max weight for the rest of my life**. Ideally, hover around the high 170's somewhere to give yourself the couple pound buffer so that you never, ever cross the 180 mark again. For the rest of your life.

### The system

**Diet**:
- **One meal a day**.
- No direct carbs (e.g. rice, breads, pasta or anything). Carbs from fresh, healthy vegetables only. Minimal bean products.
- Work towards only hojicha tea - and that too with just the water.

**Fasting**:
- Fast from Friday meal to Sunday meal => 48 hr fast every week. Basically skip one OMAD per week - on Saturday when you don't have Ashtanga. And look to replace that with a variable gym sesh: longer if you can, or if you're too tired, then short / skip it (at least for the first few weeks of this regiment).
- And **fast on moon days.** Basically, any day without Ashtanga is a fasting day. This is a good way to think about it. Ashtanga is what enables you to eat a meal. That's it. One Ashtanga session = one meal. That's it.

I want my body to get used to periodic fasting. Amen.

"If the brain and belly are burning clean / with fasting, every moment a new song comes out of the fire." - Rumi.

**Exercise**:
- Ashtanga primary series (daily - except for moon days).
- Pelvic floor exercises. (20 min sesh) in the morning / afternoon / right before you sleep. Pick a time and stick to it every single day.
- Daily 20 min weight room in the early afternoon OR a run + pushups: right after Ashtanga, but before the meal. This makes sense. Can go on a run - embarcadero to Sajj or something like that. Hmm... but would need to start Ashtanga at 5:30 every day in order to make that schedule so that you can pick up a meal in time.
	- Kettle bell.
	- Pushups.
	- Pull-ups very important.
- Once a week: long run.

Guaranteed:
- Ashtanga - guaranteed.
- Pelvic floor workout.

Either:
- Running + pushups + core / weight room (alternate days?)

Or:
- Strict Keto OMAD. And I mean super fucking strict. Plus: weekend fasting (every weekend).
- Daily 20 mins weight room: kettle bell, pushups (max out alternate days, pullups (balance out muscles from the back as well).

I'm leaning towards the latter. Because it's far more sustainable. If I can just get the diet down, then everything else falls into place, AND it saves time, so even as I get busier I won't have to sacrifice this system.

But, even more important than the diet is the **fasting**. If I can do the 2 day fast every single week, with (keto + omad) the rest of the days, I'll set myself up to shed weight quickly.

And explosive weight training actually helps more - do it right before / after the Ashtanga session.

One / twice a week can do the occasional long cardio.

Weekends (during the fast), it's important to stick to the workout routine.

**So basically**: I'll eat Friday night, and then I'll skip Sat and Sun food, and my next meal will be Monday evening.

The rest of the weekdays, I'm only going to eat one meal a day - make sure to include 4 eggs, no matter what the meal is. E.g. You can eat at the Sajj place, but eat some hardboiled eggs on the way, etc.

Eat till 60% full, and then don't eat at all.

From tomorrow onwards, make all the teas after the first cup with just water. It'll be important to cut down on this constant intake of calories.
