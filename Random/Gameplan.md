### Steps
1. Brainstorm what you **want to create**. And **why**. Start small. So small that you should be able to publish a video once every 2 days (and eventually daily). That's the only cadence that will work. If a style doesn't allow for this cadence, change the style, not the cadence.
2. Brainstorm the **identity** you want to have in this process, and why. (This is actually far more important than you think. It would help to establish a different persona for yourself. At some point you can drop it, but at the start, it'll be quite useful).
3. Build a sort of "**style system**" - very similar to a design system, but for visual. Apply constraints in the same way Jack Butcher did for VV. Constraints will help you be more productive by minimizing the number of decisions to make. Investing in a style system up front is useful (because you'll need it anyway even for the first video: else you can't create!).
	1. **Cautiously consume** some content (especially ancient arts from Asia - Japan and India) in order to build this "style board".
4. Choose the first scene to bring to life, and **go fucking hard**.
5. **Join communities**: (Discord, Reddit), Create alt Twitter, Insta, TikTok profiles and follow a set of creators that are tinkering and explaining how they use cutting edge tools to create. My primary purpose here would be to:
	1. Maximize my learning rate for the tools.
	2. Enable getting feedback from folks that are way better than I am, to help me improve more quickly (and build worthwhile connections). Amen.

### What I want to learn this phase:
1. A sense for what my visual style is. (E.g. a "mood board" esque thing).
2. Great comfort in the creation workflow: I need to have it locked down so that I can produce, and explore angles, really fucking quickly.
3. A deep understanding of AI tools for creation.

That's it. Let's get it.
### Big picture:

I want to explore my visual voice. I want to open up my mind to that way of creation. It's a completely different mode of expression that I want to explore.

I'm actually reasonably alright with the worst case as: joining a cutting edge creative AI company with a focus on product. That would be OK. I'll use the 2 years to learn like a madman. Amen.
### Practical:

You have 2 weeks. If you're unable to be obsessed / productive with this angle, then back to the drawing board).

But that's the thing, you have to be very careful with this experiment in the sense, you have to be absolutely ALL IN. There's no two ways about it. You can't half ass something like this. At all.

But, for some reason, I'm quite confident in an angle in this direction. It's the perfect blend of the things that I'm geared for.
