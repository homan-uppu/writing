This is an interesting question.
I've found that for some reason when I write pen & paper, I'm just a better thinker. I'm not sure why.

But, at the same time, I do miss the organization and speed of typing when I have a quick / random thought that I want to jot down somewhere.

And naturally, there are more distractions on the computer. Any break can devolve into a Youtube / Twitter session and that's far from productive.

In fact, I believe that I write best when I have absolutely no distractions to pull me away from it. That's the power of writing.
