I've borrowed money to do things that haven't worked out. I feel terrible about these outcomes.

Before, I used to feel the drive to try again and make it work the next time around. I had a sort of naive enthusiasm about everything.

I seem to have lost a bit of that. I've let the world beat it out of me.

I seem to have lost a bit of my fire. Maybe I'll get it back one day. Maybe I won't. But what I can say is that no matter what happens I need to keep moving forward.

The nature of the mind is that feelings, sensations, states come and go, often outside of our control. Everything passes and so shall this low phase. I just have to keep moving forward.

This feeling of shame will pass as well. I need to remember to focus on what's in my control, and put myself in positions in which I can succeed.
