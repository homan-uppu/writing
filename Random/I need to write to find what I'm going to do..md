Limbo state of mind is death. You must come out of this asap. Keep writing.

If you let this phase continue, you're fucked. That's the cold hard honest truth. You must find a way around this. Seriously.

I don't think I'd want to build the B2B angle unless I absolutely have to.

Whatever it is, you're going to start work on an angle tonight. You can't afford to be stuck in limbo right now. You're going to find an angle with a systematic analysis.
### Angles
1. LLM interface (**single player first**, and then for teams). There's also a notion of an LLM "app" - that would be interesting to explore as well.
2. **Individual agent that teaches / helps you explore a domain of knowledge**. (Consumer / Prosumer to start with, and then get into b2b) - Search, discovery, etc.
3. 
### Constraints

Not much runway. I don't have the bandwidth to do an experiment that won't lead to results. If a very experimental direction is the direction, then you probably ought to be in India... but, that's problematic for various, fuck all reasons. You can't have strong focus there. Well, you can, but it's tougher - that's for sure. Hmm..

Which means 

### Intensity
- Tonight will be an intense grind night. I don't care how you feel about anything. It's time to start the fucking grind. The act of grinding itself will show you angles. You need to take steps towards the clouds to see the gaps. Amen. No distractions whatsoever. Just analyze your constraints, options, decide and move forward. Amen.
