I'm going to pursue storytelling: visual - i.e. the kind of work that I started in India: i.e. short "films".

Need to figure out the angle, but once I do, I'm going to challenge myself to publish on a regular cadence for 2 months, and then evaluate. Amen.

It's only when you create (things that are actually meaningful to you, not just "creating" for the sake of creating), then you'll understand how to enable that muscle (for yourself).

Choose the medium.

Depending on the medium, have alt Twitter, Insta, TikTok, YT accounts (same handle) to post under. Use these to understand what it means.

And then go hard. Aim to be prolific, and let the pieces settle where they may.
Will require a couple of weeks to build a "system" - i.e. something that enables me to create content in the way that aligns with my style & works with the kind of content I'm looking to create.

Interesting.

This might completely backfire. But, I don't really see an option here. Do you? Nope.

Within one month, I should have some sense of what's going on. And can then use that as leverage to join a team. Amen.

Now, it's time to be an artist. Let's get it.
