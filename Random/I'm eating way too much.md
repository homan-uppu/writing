I'm so stuffed. Unnecessarily full. And it's too late in the evening for this shit tbh. I shouldn't be eating so much, so late. It defeats the purpose.

My sleep suffers. I wake up more groggy than I need to. My body feels lethargic as a result of overconsumption. There doesn't seem to be anything beneficial to this whatsoever.

And yet I'm doing this over and over again. It's time to break out of this. Amen.
