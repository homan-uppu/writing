The incentives do point to the teachings (for full liberation) disappearing, making it incredibly necessary to practice as much as you can in this lifetime. It's imperative. You have no idea which universe / world / humans you'll be born into, and it is highly unlikely that they will have the teachings - since the teachings (for full liberation) are an anomaly: the incentives work ferociously to wipe them out. What will remain will be a surface level technique to bring about only enough inner peace to maximize transactions.

This means I need to adapt my gameplan.

If liberation truly is a goal, I need to start as soon as possible. It's a blessing to be born into a state of the world that still has the teachings. Make the most of it!

And you must start practicing noble speech (and ideally silence) as much as possible moving forward. Any useless / wasted conversation will unnecessarily derail you and waste precious time. Amen.

The system is quite clear. Eventually escape it.

BUT: the way the incentives are moving also mean that the world will be ripe for the teaching of full liberation to be preserved, despite no one caring about it. The technologies exist, and the incentives show that it will be possible to store information in such a way that cannot be censored.

So I actually don't see how the teachings will be lost. The only thing that may happen is that no one practices them, and it won't be popular at all. Which is what it is, I have no feelings about that. But: the teachings should exist somewhere.

Fascinating.

Later in life I ought to write a comprehensive essay on the path to liberation, and preserve it in such a way that it can be accessed by anyone, anywhere, for as long as our species evolves.
