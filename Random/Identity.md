A new identity to free myself from the baggage of my old one.

I want to drop my old habits and tendencies.

I want to play a character that I aspire to be, even if I'm not yet "at that level".

I want to be more free, unburdened by old ways of thinking, of expressing myself.

I want to free myself from my own craving to maintain a beautiful, pretty, clean image of myself in the world. A craving that leads me to censor myself without even knowing I'm censoring myself - in order to fit into an identity box that I've created for myself.

Of course, arduous mental training is required to be truly free, and adopting a new identity at the conscious level won't reach the deep recesses of my mind.

But a new identity at the conscious level will likely reach more areas of my mind that I anticipate. A new identity, a new name, a new visual attachment, a new character that I play means that I have the opportunity to rewrite at least some of my tendencies.

### Defining this new identity / character

Qualities:
- Unapologetically speaks his mind.
- Aggressively gets what he wants. Nothing gets in his way whatsoever.
- His determination is unmatched.
- He doesn't overthink. He's fast to action. When inspiration strikes, he pounces on that opportunity.
- He isn't affected by short-term public perception of what / who he is. He doesn't give a fuck.
- He plays long-term games.
- He shows up every fucking day.
- He respects the small actions that lead to the long-term results he wants. No work is below him. 
- He asks for what he wants.
- When he starts a project, he would rather die than quit without at least some sort of reasonable exit for the project.

### Back story

He was born in a war-torn country into deep poverty.

He had to see his family struggle to survive, to make ends meet. In that position he felt incredibly helpless. He would have been willing to kill in order to protect and feed his family. There was nothing he wouldn't do. But there was nothing he could.

This trauma haunts him.

At the same time, he also happens to love technology - and what it can do to enable the economic prosperity for everyone that he deeply craves. He doesn't want any other child, or any other family, to go through what he and his family have.

His trauma, coupled with his craving to build a better future for the world, drive him to prolifically create.

He won't let anyone stop him. Any challenge in his journey to create pales in comparison to what he had to endure growing up.

He's not going to take no for an answer. He's ready for the fight. Losing is not a fucking option. Amen.

You can always figure out the angling of the name to make it work. Just have to find the right name though. Amen.

Don't spend too much time on this. You need to get to the actual designs lol. But yes, once you pick a name, just stick to it. You definitely can't decide right now. Give yourself a couple of days. And whatever comes up comes up.

Shunya (too common)

Nothing matters - from an ego perspective. It all matters from a suffering perspective.

They'd need some last name to get along, and the best one I think would be Zai. A short and simple last name with a ring to it.

Actually, don't even need a personal site. Fuck that. Just keep shipping in the open. Use Twitter, Substack, and any other platform. And strictly keep your content on those platforms. Amen.

But, do get the domain and redirect to Twitter (for now).
