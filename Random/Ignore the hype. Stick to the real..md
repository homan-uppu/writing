This is the best advice I can give to myself at this moment. There is so much hype out there and it's super easy to get distracted. But I must have a compelling mission, and a well thought out "charter", before getting started here. 

I'm not just going to build another "company", I have an actual, massive, real, problem that I need to solve over the next 20 years. That's the approach I want to take. Amen.
