How to tackle the intro?



----

- College isn't training minds to thrive in this world.
- Employment numbers mask the truth:
	- Hidden unemployment.
	- The squeeze: less stability, longer hours, greater uncertainty, and with rising expenses means that it becomes more difficult to settle down.
	- And importantly, people have to find work whether college enables them to do so or not. And yet colleges attempt to take credit for people getting work whereas the reality is likely that individuals had to figure out a lot on their own in order to land jobs.

(Something about positive sum game? Not sure).
