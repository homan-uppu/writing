Take it by the moment. No guilt. Just one step at a time.
Find your footing before you look up with the ambition to scale a mountain. Amen.

Rest of today ought to be deep work. Amen.

Also: have you considered just getting a coworking membership? That might just be a better set up for you tbh.

I actually definitely think it would be. Amen. Just the routine of getting out of the home, and having some more structure - to work out of a place. Amen.
