### Story

Jisnu Zai is my new identity.

He's fast, determined, driven with a powerful can-do attitude.
He doesn't overthink things. He gets a feel for things quickly, and aggressively chases down what he wants. He won't allow anything to stop him or get in his way.
His focus is unparalleled. His ferocity is unmatched. His determination is steadfast. 

Resolute. Unwavering. Cannot be conquered. Does not back down.

When he decides to do something, he will see it through.

No matter how small the project, he will ship, and he will push it to an exit. He doesn't drop things in the middle.

He's balanced, yet aggressive. Balancing both in the way the ancient Jishnu did in the Kurukshetra war: a mind so concentrated that the ego doesn't have the space to push him off of his course.

When he attacks something, he does it with such force that whatever challenges he faces crumble in the face of his dogged persistence and ferocity.

### What he cares about

While he has larger ambitions 

### Visual

A man, 
- A visual in Midjourney: Jisnu riding through flames, with a balanced face deep in concentration, with arrow pulled back. Simultaneously ferocious & calm. Completely absorbed and steadfast in pursuit of his goals, without the attachment that leads to stress.
