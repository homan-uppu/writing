Agenda:
1. Define this phase.
2. Bring clarity to execution path.
3. Start work on crafting the angle. It's all day errday from here on out. No fucking nonsense breaks and shit.

----

This phase will be a race to get traction. That's it. **Nothing else matters**. At all.

I really don't want to be in India - that's not where the work is happening.

I want to be right fucking here. I'm going to build my startup here. I'm going to raise money right here. I'm going to build a team right here. I'm going to create value right fucking here. That's it.

I'm going to do whatever it takes to make that happen.

But, how to justify living expenses? Hmm... you can't. That's the fucking problem. You simply buy yourself some time to pay things off. That's it.

It's a weak move to leave here without making some dough to take with me. That would be a very stupid outcome. Seriously.

I already know what the networking and fundraising opportunities are here - but at the same time, I can always just fly back to do those. There is no need to be right here and build - that's the essence of it all.
