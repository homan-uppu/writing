(This is the critical section of the essay that really supports the main argument). It supports my claims with reality. Amen.

Brainstorming the essence of this:
1. **Economic crunch for lower skilled**.
2. **Bootcamps**. to explain why transactional learning model fails.
	1. Talk about Hyderabad bootcamps for software testing - and link the hilarious video. This is actually necessary to talk about here. Bootcamps DID work back then because of the lower technological leverage.
3. **Credentialing**. to explain why standardized interviews fail.
4. **Compensation** more accurately reflecting variance in talent, with equity a major component. to explain what? What's the purpose of this point? Similar to how the best actors, directors, musicians make millions (if not more), the best engineers will command massive compensation (equity, cash). (This should go in the section above - consequences).

**And another very important point:**
- As leverage increases, and the gap between the best and average increases, companies can no longer afford to hire average talent because the economics no longer works out, and they'll be outcompeted.
- When the best is only, say, 5x better than the average, you might be able to get away with hiring 5 average people and paying each a fraction. But when the best is orders of magnitudes better, then you'll have **no choice** but to get them because you simply can't compete with 1000s of people vs. the best due to organizational inefficiencies.
- This further drives down demand for the average, and increases demand for the high performers, and raises the skill bar even higher.

In fact, let's organize this as:
1. Consequences of rising skill bar.
2. Support each consequence with an analysis of the software engineering space.
