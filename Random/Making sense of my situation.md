I'm going broke and have no clear path to generating revenue.

All I want to do in this phase is to write, for some strange reason. This is the skill that I most want to develop right now. I don't want to be a "writer", but I want to express myself through writing. That feels important to me right now, for some reason.

And I definitely want to build a product here as well. A great product worth building. But not one for the sake of just making money. I need the product that I build to be meaningful to me. It needs to matter to me even when I look back on it decades later. That's what I crave.

I want to use writing as a way to make better decisions. I want to be smarter. And the way I see myself becoming smarter is through writing.

There's no turning back this time though. You've taken the jump. You have to land it. You have no choice. This lack of choice is a good thing. It's the forcing function you need to break through. Absolutely.
