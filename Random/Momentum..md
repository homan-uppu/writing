It's time to start creating. Anything. Just move forward. That's all you can do at the moment. Pick yourself up, and fucking move forward. Amen.

I'm not sure at all what I'm going to do right now. This is ridiculous. There seems to be no clear path forward. But, I'm not sure what else to do.

Things I'm confident I want (need):
1. Working with others. Can't go solo anymore.
2. Revenue / traction.
3. A product that I want to use. All the fucking time.

This is batshit crazy if you ask me. Amen.

Zen mind. Beginner's mind.
Embrace it.

Just need to pick a direction and get a move on it. Amen.
