(Basically, something along the lines of "creativity isn't necessarily fun."). It's a brutal process, especially if your livelihood depends on it.
- There is no fairness in how selection happens in creative domains.
- Scarce signals are required to stand out in creative fields. This is why I think elite college opaque admissions processes actually make sense. Stanford will be a better experience because of its opaque admissions. In an alternate world in which those that do the best in a standardized test get to the top colleges, elite institutions would likely lose their ability to produce better (on average) talent.
- Similarly, YC has an extremely opaque admissions process. You simply can't have standardized / formula based approaches to admissions / hiring in creative domains.
