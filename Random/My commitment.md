1. I'm not leaving SF / Bay until I have meaningful profits. This is where I'm going to build my network, and this is where I'm going to break through. I'll do whatever it takes to see this through right here (including potentially consulting, doing Uber, etc. whatever it takes).
2. I'm going to follow a **rigorous process** for what I'm going to work on next, that ought to guarantee the generating revenue. The right process will guarantee it. It just requires discipline. And that's what you're going to bring to the approach this time around: rigor and discipline.
3. And it's time. My lack of results is also causing suffering for those around me. I can't continue to hurt them through my actions. Absolutely not.
