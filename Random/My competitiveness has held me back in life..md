My competitiveness has held me back in life.

Competition = seeing yourself in a rat race of some sort.
Rat race = assigning self worth to your current position in the race.

Envy, anger, hatred are common emotions triggered.

Competitiveness is incredibly helpful, and can even be fun for everyone involved, in zero-sum games. 

But it's a poisonous mindset for positive-sum games.

The only games worth playing are positive sum games. And the world we live in is increasingly positive sum: building products, making art, etc. are positive sum games. 

This is also why the world is more connected than ever before. One country "winning" over another is detrimental to both, unlike the past when the world was far more zero-sum and conquering another country meant you had more natural resources which are limited.

Today, on the other hand, the US and China going to war over some natural resource leads to terrible outcomes for BOTH the winner and loser of the war: they're both extremely dependent on each other to thrive: selling products to each other, and influencing each others culture.

I think a key skill is to be able to be mindful of when my competitiveness rises in my mind and let it pass without acting on it.

Competitiveness for some of us also seems to be in-built in some sense. Perhaps the world was zero-sum for most of human evolution and the value of positive-sum only occurred recently.

But at the same time, the ancients all seemed to realize the value in dissolving the ego to enable greater internal peace, and greater harmony within communities.

It's just a better way to live. Wow.

I'm sure I'll continue to struggle with this, but as I've gotten better I've been able to have more genuine connection with others. I don't feel threatened by others' success as much.

It was a sad place to be.

Competitiveness is also lonely. By nature, you separate yourself from the community by putting yourself in a race with others.

I'm going to write a letter to myself to remind me and to help me curb my competitiveness. This mental shift will help me thrive in this world. Amen.
