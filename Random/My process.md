1. Design -> any idea you have, work through the design as a way to think through the problem and the solution.
2. IFF the design is compelling, build the MVP. Else, just ship the design on its own as a "concept".

That's it. It's really that simple. And just keep iterating on this.
Eventually, create a website where you can share more in depth work. With that work, perhaps do some consulting.

And, that's it.

BUT: ideally, you take a design to completion - to generate money from it. Amen. That's it.

Take the Quentin approach: "script" first, as a standalone piece. Only after the script makes sense, you have a choice whether to pursue building it, or moving on. Either way, only THEN is when you make the choice. Amen.
