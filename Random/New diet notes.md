I couldn't finish my food last night. The veggies portion of it.

How about the following:
1. 8 hardboiled eggs.
2. Spinach. (Rinse and eat)
3. Guac / 2 avocados.
4. Macademia nuts & almonds.

And that's it. It feels more rudimentary, but I think it'll remove the headache of trying to cook a great tasting meal (which will take a lot more time and effort on the cooking part - with the veggies and everything).

But this prob. means that you need to make sure you're regular with the supplements.

You have about 15 - 20 pounds of fat you can drop. Don't worry about under-eating until you get to 180 pounds in weight. And I think you can go even lower than that if need be.

But the most important thing is to have only one meal a day. It's really important to be fasted through the day. That's where most of the health benefits will come from. Amen. And stick to the Ashtanga in the evening - on all days, including Sundays, except for the scheduled moon days. That's it.

This is the required discipline that will slowly, but surely, give you back control over your life. Amen. Just drink water. Seriously. Amen. The problem with Matcha is in addition to the sugars that are usually added to it at cafes, the base milk is problematic: oat / whole - it's just straight up carbs. And the almond milk also has sugar in it. So, the whole ordeal is problematic.

Just avoid it entirely. Amen.

Let's get it.
