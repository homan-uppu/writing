Doing this well will set you up for success. Craft the system well.

1. Go through my following list and either put into a list or unfollow them.
2. For the product design list, go through 10 of them, into their following list and explore. Look to add 1 - 3 from each to the Product Design list.

JI will be used purely for product design community (the film community should only involve those that will help you craft product related films, or YT films, not mainstream cinema, etc.).

For general startup related news and stuff, rely on your koopuluri account.

Choose people with low follower count (ideally under 10k, but up to 100k is fine).

Fuck lists, make this profile even more focused: designers / builders with my kind of taste. That's it. Lists are too hard to manipulate.
