I want everything to be absolutely excellent.
- Landing page.
- Messaging (how you're going to communicate this product).
- Design: including the details such as animations, fonts, spacing, everything!
- Engineering: solid architecture that enables you to iterate quickly and minimize bugs.
- A stellar launch ad - rent out a stage to perform this on, and do a hilarious parody of Steve Jobs... to present a gamechanging "voice recording" app. LOL. That would be HILARIOUS, and I think I could pull that off well. Amen.

Anyone that sees the app / hears about it needs to be struck by the quality, the craft.

The craft is as important as the utility.

Great product design and execution must become a core part of YOU, and thereby the culture of the work you do, and the team you build.

And be very, very thoughtful of what data you capture, what metrics you track, the waitlist, how you process that waitlist, how you incentivize people to share the app with others, the sharing functionality, your outreach to friends and potential users for feedback, and generally how you organize this process.

I'd also want a solid "dashboard" app that I can get all the information I need about my app(s). From all of the analytics, to maybe even handling support. Fascinating. I think that would be really interesting as well.

Keep building for self. Keep shipping. Maintain a very high bar for quality.
