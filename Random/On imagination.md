Channeling your imagination and using your mind to visualize is the most powerful way to design.
Don't touch the computer until you have a design in your mind.

Train your visual mind to be able to process designs in the mind. That ought to be the first session. If you can't do it, then train yourself to do it, because there's absolutely nothing faster, or more powerful, than using your imagination.

So yeah, go out now, sit, and don't come back to the computer until you have a design you want to bring to life. LFG!
