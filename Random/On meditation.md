Buddha himself used to say "just keep on observing sensations and leave everything else to time - kalam agameya"

I need to get back to the scanning.

90 mins Anapana.
90 mins Scanning.

This is the breakdown.

And absolutely no breaking Sila at all from here on out.
Any sort of breaking it impacts ALL aspects of the mind.

It's important to get this foundation right. It's the most important thing to get right. Amen.

Today's benefits are literally from 30 mins of the 3 hours. When that duration increases, it will be a powerful foundation. Keep working on it brother.

The practice is so interesting.
It teaches you about yourself in profound ways.
It's the only way. I'm convinced.

I'm going to sit my first long course at the end of 2025.
From then onwards, I'm going to sit **at least** a 30 day course a year.
I'm going to maintain a perfect daily practice and Sila for the rest of my life.
I'm going to maintain one meal a day for the rest of my life (except in case of medical emergencies, iff I have to eat more).
I'm going to maintain my Yoga practice (except for during courses).

This is solid. This is the path. And you're on it.

This is the highest priority in your life. Stick to it.

And be OK sacrificing other things in life to keep this a priority. By that I mean: maybe this schedule doesn't suit building the next Amazon, or whatever.

And you have to be OK with that.

Do everything in your power to protect this practice. You have to.
As you continue to walk on the path, you'll be grateful for it.

OK, now that this is set in place, make a plan AROUND this. Amen.
This could even include working remotely for a bit to earn some money.

This is a long path. Be patient.
Let it come to you. Don't reach.
