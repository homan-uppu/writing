The things that have gotten to me in recent times revolve around people challenging my competence and value in this world.

I've gotten better at not reacting to that. But those are the things that have affected me somewhere deep inside.

I'm going to continue to be aware of this and do my best to not let this feeling of "proving myself" cloud my judgement on what to work on, how to work, and how I live life.

By reacting (shifting my actions as a result of that feeling), I'm basically letting the people that challenge my worth, dictate how I live life. Those are the last people that should have a say in how I build my life, therefore it's especially important that I clip their influence on my at the depths of my mind.
