This is a powerful process. I agree with PG: I believe that those who haven't published any meaningful writing haven't thought about anything deeply.

It is the most powerful process for conscious learning that I've come across so far, second to the practice of self-observation (nothing beats this).

Just have to keep writing. This is the path. This is the only path that I see at the moment.

Writing is how you clarify your thinking. It is a powerful medium to communicate your thinking with others. The starting point for any collaborative process.

I can't imagine anything more worthwhile to do with my time (at this moment when I'm figuring out exactly what to work on, and how to go about it). 

Nothing is as clarifying as writing about what I think could be the greatest (in the sense of magnitude) ideas of our generation.

If I build a company and put a product out into the world, one of the main reasons will be so that I can learn, and write about what I've learned. That itself is an incredible motivator for me.
