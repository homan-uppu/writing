Fabulous movie. One of the best movies I've seen in recent times. Incredible.

**Takeaways**:
1. Ambition. Think big. Act big.
2. Team. You need a great team to achieve great results. There is no one man operation. You might be alone in the initial stages before you can attract a team, but the goal must be to attract the best minds. No individual superstars. The greater mission should be what binds the team. **Championships, not MVPs**. That's the most important mindset to have.

And act with integrity. This man broke trust of his friends because he couldn't keep his desire in his control. Unfortunate. I only want to learn from his execution ability, not from his personal life / his mind. I don't want that kind of mind that can actively hurt those closest to you in such a deep way. Can't imagine he was that peaceful.
