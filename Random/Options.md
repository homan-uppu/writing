1. **Hit the LLM "client" for teams angle hard** - sales first approach w/ an extraordinary product experience (showcase - don't build anything before the sell). Aim to get traction in a month or so. Focus hard on the selling up front. Only after "x" conversations, nail the product roadmap, and get the MVP out the door.
	1. Will need to do research here first to get a thorough understanding of the state of things.
	2. You could also focus on a more "consulting" type role here: installing these systems at companies (but each "contract" there will likely be months long - but you'll charge through the roof for the professional services). Fuck that, target much smaller companies, in a more self-serve fashion, and only then move up the market. Amen.
	3. There is still a design challenge here. A big one, but it's clear what needs to be explored, and why. The overall direction is far more grounded in reality.

2. Go product first, targeting individuals (still paid for sure, but the roadmap should be short).
