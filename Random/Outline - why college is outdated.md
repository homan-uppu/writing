**It isn't working**
- Quantitative stats on why.
- Qualitative stats.

**Creative vs. non-creative skills**.
- Inputs don't translate to outputs.
- How technology creates leverage, that raises the bar for creativity for any skill in knowledge work.

**Features of creative domains, in a highly technologically leveraged world:**
- **Power law distribution of outcomes**: Infinite demand for high performers, little to no demand for juniors / average..
	- Explain this by speaking on behalf of companies - their incentives and how that leads to ignoring the average / beginners.
- **Education and hiring resist standardization**.
	- No guaranteed path to mastery, especially on a fixed timeline. (Just the nature of it, no need to try and explain this in detail).
		- Theory no longer valuable on its own.
		- By definition, no clear training.
	- Similarly, you can't have a standardized interview (i.e. a quiz / some constrained exercises) because, by definition, if you could, then you could have a standardized education that trains for it. But you can't, and therefore hiring has to be via unscalable, backchannel efforts through introductions, etc.
- **Transactional education model (pay to learn) no longer works**.
	- Too expensive, and due to unreliable outcomes, taking out a loan is also not possible.
		- And masters are prohibitively expensive for creative skills that have a market. Due to power law, the best are making bank and can't be compensated for personalized feedback.
	- This impacts colleges, bootcamps, and anything that takes an up front fee to train you in a particular skill. Which is why most bootcamps, and "ed-tech" has been relegated to offering courses to people who are already employed / have savings to spend, NOT the hundreds of millions of teenagers that desperately need training to help them thrive in this world.
	- This is why MOOCs have been similarly relegated to offering courses to company employees, not training the next generation of the world as they initially set out to do. People don't learn for the sake of learning, they learn to be able to create value in this world, so that they can build a better life for themselves and their loved ones.
	- The entire transactional education market today exists because of standardized admissions / interviewing. As companies start to ignore the standard (because it no longer works), this impact will back-propagate through the entire chain of education.
	- Most of the value created by the ed-tech companies trains people for some kind of standardized exam: either to pass grade school exams, high school exams, college entrance exams, and cracking job interview exams. If there's no standardized exam to educate for (since they no longer work), then people won't shell out money to pay for these education programs.
	- Put in other words: standardization creates a market for transactional education. So the world actually has a strong economic incentive to create a standard, it would lead to a massive education market, and will enable us to build an education program at scale for the world. But if you artificially prop up a standard that isn't aligned with the reality (i.e. that the standard doesn't actually correspond with talent in the market), then the entire system will eventually collapse.
- **Unproven talent: new grads, juniors, are less valuable**.
	- When bar for creativity was lower, as a company, you could hire unproven junior talent and take the responsibility to train them for the job. 
	- From a company's perspective, as a skill becomes more creative, they can't justify this type of hiring because there's no guarantee in the outcomes.
	- Case study: if you could train 1000 employees out of which 500 end up being competent in 2 years, that's alright. But in creative skills, the variance in outcomes can be extremely high, making this entire proposition incredibly risky. On top of this, companies are generally bad at firing. By letting in a large number of incompetent employees, you've killed the culture of the company.

And therefore, it's **increasingly difficult and uncertain to train the skills necessary to thrive in this world**.
- Counter: "But you have great content online from masters! It's the best time to learn anything :)" - it's actually much tougher today than in the past due to mental security. The security that the path you're walking will lead to results one day, that you will have an ROI on your investment and won't be crippled with debt for rest of life.
- Any security a non-master gives you is a false one. Perhaps that's great for mental health in the short-run, but you can't escape reality for too long.
- The required mental fortitude to survive the self-learning path is too massive - when you don't have the outcome guarantees. I don't think I'd have been able to when I was 18.
- => It's actually tougher today than it has ever been.

**Grounding in reality: software engineering as a case study**:
- Power law -> new grads struggle, outsourcing shops struggle, while upper bound compensation skyrocketing.
- India is a really good example of representing this shift. Due to the outsourcing model of previous generation of companies, India has a massive pool of non-creative software engineers. So many that India has built a stereotype of terrible engineers. Yet, if you're an engineer that is skilled - then you can command exceptional compensation. Some of the best and worst engineers I know are from India.
- Bootcamps don't work anymore.
	- Lambda school case study.
	- History: they did work in the past! Once again, talk about the Hyderabad boot camp craze (this is my backyard, I'm the expert on this, show the world what it hasn't really thought about).
- Standardized credentialing doesn't work.
- Concluding thoughts: the rising bar for creativity in software engineering has squeezed new grads, and low creativity individuals out of the market. Hiring resembles talent-hunting in creative fields, the compensation for top-talent is skyrocketing due to increased leverage.

**Yet, why is college still the mainstream path?**
1. No alternatives.
2. Delayed outcomes means that it takes time for the market to adjust.
3. Cultural significance.
4. Government subsidies, becomes a taxpayer burden. But, this isn't going to be the case in emerging economies. Going back to the India example: people need results. Much more powerful market forces in India, and by extension Asia (due to cultural reasons).

**Why colleges can't adapt**
- **Systemic challenges**: designed from the ground up to optimize for a non-creative world. A shift away from this requires a massive culture change, and I'm very pessimistic about large institutions / organizations successfully changing their culture in a radical way.
- **Economic**: For the same reason bootcamps failed: the economics doesn't work out. And non-master educators will perform increasingly poorly, as the creativity bar rises.
- Why elite institutions will still be around. Something something brand, culture, and they actually serve a purpose: for long-term research. But all the colleges that derive their revenue by selling the dream of employment will have a tough time surviving.

**What's next?**
- Investing in individuals.
	- Talk about the PG approach to education. I mean, YC is basically an educational institute. This model makes sense for the way education is heading:
		- Masters only give feedback to the most promising students, and set themselves up to **benefit in the long-run via one off hits.** , enabling them to 
- AI has the potential to fundamentally change the economics (amplify the reach of masters - via personalized feedback at scale).
	- In creative domains, even the quality of teachers follows the power law. And therefore, it's incredibly important to enable the best to reach the masses, not just through content, but through personalized feedback (which is where most of the value is for creative skills).
- Learning ecosystems around tools: i.e. TikTok, Youtube, Replit, Figma, etc. have a great incentive to teach, and they have a powerful vantage point to understand what's working and to train AI to be able to teach according to what works.
- Policy changes that **give more choice** to individuals to pick their learning paths.
- UBI - we'll need it. But incredibly tough path to enabling this.

**Concluding thoughts**
- Reinforce why I think this is one of the most important problems out there. Discuss the scale of the problem and why it's a bigger problem than it appears (because those that have skill are surrounded by skill and therefore their perception of the average is much greater than what it actually is. And those that are reading this essay likely fall into the skilled category).
	- Unfortunately governments are going to spend a great deal subsidizing education that will no longer work... this is super sad.
	- A billion youth will through the education system - doing everything they're told to do by their families, teachers, and society, only to end up struggling to build the lives they want. And naturally they're going to despise older generations, and the institutions that lied to them. (To be fair, they didn't intentionally lie, they gave advice based on their outdated understanding of the world, but the suffering causes is the same).
	- We desperately need a high quality learning system available at scale, with the right underlying incentives, that trains the right creative skills. We need policy changes that reflect the higher bar for creativity and all the changes this brings. We need

**What is skill**

**Nature**
1. Outcomes not guaranteed - especially on an arbitrary timeline.
2. Power law distribution.

**Consequences**
1. Rising demand for high performers, and demand for average / beginners in free-fall.
2. Education and hiring resist standardization.
3. Transactional education model no longer works.

All of this means that it's **increasingly difficult and uncertain to train the skills necessary to thrive in this world**.

Now I'm going to show you how these consequences have played out in software engineering. What's happening in software engineering is happening throughout all minimally regulated knowledge work.

(Acknowledge the optimistic angle here: there has never been greater opportunity to do so, but on average it's tougher - another weird situation haha. These two points seem the opposite, and yet they're simultaneously true. Wow.).

-> Greater variance in compensation. (This actually won't happen. In fact, I think compensation as a whole will increase, while variance will decrease.). Really interesting point. There's an essay here: **trade market granularity (?) for efficiency**.

(An aside)
There's also an interesting point on the timeline: if you stretch the timeline long enough, you start to be able to guarantee results. If someone goes through a creative training for 20 years with sincere dedication, I'm quite confident they'll be able to create value in that skill. But the shorter the timeline, the more precarious the proposition.
