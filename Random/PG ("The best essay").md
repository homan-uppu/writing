- I need to write simply like PG without all the complexities of various titles, subheaders and frankly, over-organization. I now see why PG organizes his essay as one flowing stream of thought rather than organized into chunks because this is the most natural way to communicate a story - it feels like he's giving an informal talk to a group of people, and that's the best.

> There is, and on the face of it, it seems almost identical to the one I started with. Instead of asking _what would the best essay be?_ I should have asked _how do you write essays well?_ Though these seem only phrasing apart, their answers diverge. The answer to the first question, as we've seen, isn't really about essay writing. The second question forces it to be.

- It's incredibly valuable to try and find different questions to start from, that the truth finds more welcoming to express itself into.

> You have to be very strict when rereading, not just because you want to keep yourself honest, but because a gap between your response and the truth is often a sign of new ideas to be discovered.

- There is a popular notion of "truth", and PG using it this way gives me confidence re. the way I've used "truth" in "seeking truth".

> The prize for being strict with what you've written is not just refinement. When you take a roughly correct answer and try to make it exactly right, sometimes you find that you can't, and that the reason is that you were depending on a false assumption. And when you discard it, the answer turns out to be completely different.

- This is literally seeking truth in the domain of ideas.

> But essays are linear, not tree-shaped, which means you have to choose one branch to follow at each point. How do you choose? Usually you should follow whichever offers the greatest combination of generality and novelty.

> I don't consciously rank branches this way; I just follow whichever seems most exciting

- An example of PG having expertise in the realm of feeling, but not being able to communicate it. And even if he could, the recipient wouldn't be able to implement it in the same way.

> If you're willing to do a lot of rewriting, you don't have to guess right. You can follow a branch and see how it turns out, and if it isn't good enough, cut it and backtrack. I do this all the time. In this essay I've already cut a 17-paragraph subtree, in addition to countless shorter ones. Maybe I'll reattach it at the end, or boil it down to a footnote, or spin it off as its own essay; we'll see.

- It takes a stupid amount of time to write a good essay. I basically wrote a book and am just starting to feel like I can write the essay I want to write.

> It would be a mistake to let this make you too conservative though, because you can't predict where a question will lead. Not if you're doing things right, because doing things right means making discoveries, and by definition you can't predict those. So the way to respond to this situation is not to be cautious about which initial question you choose, but to write a lot of essays. Essays are for taking risks.

- Excellent point. Let each essay be an arrow you shoot to see if your ambitious idea has some footing. Don't reduce the ambition, but fire more arrows.
