I can pay rent, etc. till roughly end of Jan. After which I have:
- Nov, Dec, Jan.
- Feb, Mar, April, May

I'm about 12k in the negative. By December 15th if no traction, then it's time for me to consult and pay off debt in full.

Which means that it's super critical to execute these 3 months such that you at least set yourself up to consult in this space.

### The approach

You need to grab attention along with ship product. You have no choice but to be hyper active on Twitter, and potentially even Youtube (ship your process).

3 months of thinking in, shipping in public, and you should have something quite tangible to show by the end of the year.

I can also guarantee that if you can ship any such agent that gets some traction, you will be able to raise. 100%.

### The game is in the mind.

Mistakes:
1. I put myself in debt. I shouldn't have even been in this situation. This debt burden is a real burden and I want to get out of it ASAP.
