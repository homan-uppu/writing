1. Exchange my time for money.
2. Publish on any kind of "regular" schedule. I will publish when it's ready to publish. I'd rather do it as best as I can than publish something I'm not proud of. Quentin Tarantino vs. Youtuber. Artistry > Algorithm. My creation model resembles films / books, not social media videos.
3. Invest in companies that are not my own for the sake of investing. I might invest if I believe the capital would be useful, but I simply can't commit to more than one company (my company). It's that simple.
4. Accept brand sponsors, i.e. exchange my platform for money.

Whatever I give will be for free.

I don't look down on people that do these things. Everyone has their reasons and life constraints. 

I'm sharing this in order to save you (and me) time, and to hold myself accountable.
