1. **Up the meditation**. (3 x 1hr) - I don't care if you have sits like you had this morning. You will eventually be able to "capture" more of the sit. The initial discipline is to just get your ass to sit for that duration.
2. **Fast**. (food makes you slow and sluggish). A lot. One meal a day - and that too only fills 50% of the stomach. I want you to operate on 
3. Create a **grind spot**. This is ideally not at home.

It's time for a powerful Tapasya. You must make it happen.

Losing the balance of your mind, even in subtle ways, will lead you to make the wrong decisions. And you definitely can't afford those during this phase.
