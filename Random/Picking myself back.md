I'm in the process of picking myself back up.

I've failed at the things that I've tried over the past couple of years.

I'm spending time understanding why, and working on improving myself so that I can be better this time around.

I'm in India to bring my burn down to essentially nothing to give me the time and space to reflect and improve, instead of being rushed into doing the next thing.
