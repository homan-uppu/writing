Just lay it out as it is, and start executing ruthlessly.

1. **Bring burn down to 0**. (This is completely independent from where you'll be and what you do. This is a necessity.)
2. Decide which path you're going to take (balancing experimentation with revenue). Whichever path, focus on the internal state of mind.

In order to bring burn to 0, I'm going to put in a 1 month notice on the lease.

I'll **continue staying here** with Akash until they find a replacement for the lease. This could be another 3 months in the worst case, and likely within a month or two. And in the first month, we'll have a sense of their selling momentum and hopefully a better feel for how long it will take to fill this apartment.

There's a looming unknown factor in this option that kills productivity. But the alternative is quite expensive.

You're basically paying what you would have paid till the end of the term, up front. That's sort of stupid. And that's the fundamental problem here.

**Options to bring back the certainty:**
1. Stay here, keep the lease, and grind out to land consulting contract / land a job.
2. **Pay the fine**. Move out at the end of the month. Sell everything. Bounce.

Who should I call? What's the angle? What's the bet to take? If I stay, then need to figure out a clear plan of action. Nothing else matters.

I strongly feel staying is the path. Just need to completely lock down the grind from here on out. Need to chart out a path that at the LEAST fails upwards.

Bring clarity to what this path looks like. Firstly, you don't really have much time for "R&D". There are many things to consider here.

This is the game now.

Just have to figure out an angle to play this game really fucking well.

OK. Do we put in the notice? Or just wait out the entire thing?

I'm leaning towards waiting it out and making something happen right here. Going back to Hyd will be accepting defeat big time. Like, completely. You're fucked if you do that. You'll not only have to work to create value, but also work to not be influenced by the environment you're in.

There is **no other path than to grind and make the fucking money**. You can't borrow and then not grind your ass off to repay it as soon as fucking possible. That's disrespectful.

OK. This is a problem.

OK, you have access to 10k. What does that change? Hmm...
