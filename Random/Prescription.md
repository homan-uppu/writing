- 3 x 1hr sits every single day. Next sit from 3 - 4pm.
- Ashtanga Yoga every day. No more skipping this.
- One meal post Ashtanga. No solid foods (and try to minimize tea drinking) beforehand.
- And of course, maintain perfect Sila.

If you do these, you're set. Life is really that simple. The more you avoid reinforcing this foundation, the more fucked you are. It's really just that simple.

The clouds will pass eventually. The creativity will bounce back eventually. But regardless of what happens, your daily process ought to be the same. Amen.
