There is truly something profound about those that spend their time training their mind to pierce their own ignorance.

That's a powerful way to spend time.

I think we all need to take the space and time to de-condition our minds from the decades of forced indoctrination into The System.

I'm going to take that space again at some point - hopefully in the near future, even if just for a few days. This kind of introspection is necessary to rise.
