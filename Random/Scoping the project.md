I definitely need to scope this. Can't let it run for too long without providing results.

What would be a good scope?
- What you set out to do - replicate visualizevalue's work. Pixel perfectly.

The problem here is that prompting is actually NOT the most ideal way to communicate the designs that I want. A combination of drawing / moving in a Figma type canvas / prompting feels like the right combination.

It's only when you can draw what you want, does animating make sense. Right?

Why does this feel like a dumb thing to work on? Because, I don't care about the output? Hmm... Not sure.

But, here's the thing: if you can't do this, then damn, the rest be difficult bro. If you can't create an image, then you can't animate it, and if you can't animate it, then what the hell you got bro?
