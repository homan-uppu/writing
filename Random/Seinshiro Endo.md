An Aikido master https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seishiro_Endo.

"_I began to ceaselessly examine and confirm my state of mind: myself when it went well, myself when it went poorly, myself when I was trying to defeat my partner, myself when I was feeling fear, myself when I was feeling insecure, etc. From these confirmations, **I learned the importance of ceaselessly keeping my mind calm_**".
