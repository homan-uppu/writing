Initially: separate wealth creation from content creation. Otherwise my creativity will be polluted. 100%. Falling into the trap of creating to optimize for likes and appreciation because I HAVE to in order to survive is a terrible position to be in. It's a jail for the mind.

Look at many of the top content creators. Once they get traction for a certain idea, or persona, they're forced to maintain that image for greater traction, because their identity, livelihood depend on it.

Freeing myself from identity is an inner process that I'll be doing anyway. But if I depend on creation for survival, that puts me in a pickle.

An image is just as big of a trap as anything.

By having your wealth generated elsewhere, you can create more naturally because you're not dependent on the outcomes of your creation to be able to survive. That is absolutely critical.
