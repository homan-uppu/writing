What are the promising angles to present these ideas?

1. Focus more on promising directions than on the problem and history. Nah. I think the problem is misunderstood, and the history is important to learn from - very valuable insights into the student mind by thoroughly understanding the failures here.
2. **Tangential**, but important isolated ideas: e.g. you can't have an exam for a creative domain.
