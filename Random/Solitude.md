I'm going to continue this phase of solitude until I have the results that I want.

I sense many ideas that need to be expressed. And I'm going to give them the time they need to come out.

I'm going to be incredibly patient, while simultaneously nudging, and coaxing the ideas to come out.

I'm going to give them a safe space to manifest themselves.

It's time to open up the mind and see what's really happening. Clarity is essential before I jump into the next thing. This is the phase in which I'm going to build sufficient clarity in order to proceed to the next step.
