I'm going to get into filmmaking for sure. Not necessarily making feature films, but definitely making videos. That's my medium, I can feel it. That's how I'm craving to express myself. Don't rush the process, you're going to get there eventually.

I'm going to see through this text to graphic app, and I'm going to generate revenue from it. 100%. There's no doubt in my mind about this. The starting point is clear: the MVP that I've defined is great. Even after that, no matter what changes to make, I'll have a great grasp how to build systems like this. Amen.

Have no plan. Don't be restricted to a particular label or image or notion of what you think you "ought to be doing". Be free. Take it one day at a time.

Great art arises as a byproduct of self-exploration, self-understanding and courage to see ourselves as we are: accepting the disgusting parts of ourselves along with the positives.

It arises from honesty. From the Truth.

A work of art resonates with others when it strikes an emotional chord, when it helps them see and feel a part of themselves that has always been there, but may not have been acknowledged.

I'm on my journey to find my truth and express myself honestly.

At this stage, I'm going to see through this text2Image app, and I'm going to build a solid business around it. 100%.

But firstly, the most important thing to think through for now is: what's the immediate path?

My answer to that is: don't worry about it. Just create this MVP. Once that is done, start to talk to folks that create this sort of stuff on a daily basis. I.e. researchers publishing graphs, video makers editing (with special effects, etc.).

Building this project will actually teach you the angles of the underlying technology itself, which is super important. Understand it with the MVP, and then go all guns blazing to craft it into a tool for business storytellers.

OK, this makes perfect sense. One thing I can commit to is: pursue this until exit. 100%. It's done. Explore this through. Done.
