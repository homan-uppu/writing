- What is standardization?
	- Common curriculum.
	- Standardized evaluation that's insulated from the market.
	- Standard learning timeline: e.g. a "4 year" program that will help you build "competence".
- Standardization is efficient. It's easy to scale, it's easy to optimize for, it's low risk. With the right training, there can be many people that become proficient at the standard.
- Non-creative and standardization essentially represent the same thing. Anything you can standardize is inherently non-creative.
- Markets form around standards. Most of the value created by education startups is by optimizing for standards. (training to crack exams).
- Therefore, if a standard is possible, it will be created.
- But, if a standard is no longer aligned with reality (the market), it will fall unless propped up by non-market forces like regulation.

Standardization, when it works, is economically efficient. 

This is also why, to the extent possible, people want to standardize: it's simpler to optimize for, and a market is created around standards.

For example, the standard that I'm most familiar with: IIT-JEE prep in India, and from what I can tell - the rest of Asia as well. The more clear cut the standard, the bigger the market.

Put in another way, if a standard is possible, it will exist. Non-creative domains can be standardized, and 

But standards are fragile: when they no longer translate to competence, the entire system built around the standard crumbles because the market no longer rewards the standard.

Any standard not in tune with the market (in unregulated domains) will fall.
