1. Figure out Twitch streaming format and create your set up to start streaming.

Remember. **Dispassion. Indifference.**

Just stream the crap out of everything. That's all you have to do. Just focus on it one day at a time. And that's it. Don't think of tomorrow. Don't think about your "image" that you want to build in the coming weeks. This is just a fucking experiment. It means nothing. The results don't matter. Just try it out. Amen.

And then: just hire someone to create "bits" from the streams to publish on YT / socials.

That's all there is to it. 

Drop your ego. Drop all your plans. Just move. Put yourself in the open. Be vulnerable. That's it.

And use your name: koopuluri. Just get over the internal frictions. Amen.

Everything is super straightforward.
