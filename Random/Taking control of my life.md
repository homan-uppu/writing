Yes, I feel a strong desire. A desire to gain greater control over my life. I'm sick and tired of living this way: without much control, always having to "adapt", or "adjust" to the environment.

It's time to take back control. Of course, I can't do that by craving for it - in fact that will make it even more difficult.

The only path I have is to patiently, persistently, execute. And execute I must.

Let the agitation pass and plan taking control calmly, methodically, with incredible patience.

I know exactly what I want for this upcoming phase of life:
1. A space dedicated to seeking truth (internally, and thereby externally).
2. The ability to travel and experience other cultures first hand. I am a wanderer at heart. I want to go and experience other cultures through the people of the cultures. I want to visit places like China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, various parts of India. I want to live there for a few months each (at the least), learn the language, culture, and the way the people operate. I might not do this much, but I at least want to have the ability to do so. I want to do this to better understand the human condition: to learn from the greats of all cultures, to be able to experience their works.

What would my ideal space look like?
1. Embedded in nature, without the noises of human activity. Minimal. Everything in the home nudges me towards seeking truth.
2. A separate meditation unit in the backyard (separated from the entire house).
3. Close enough to SF city where the action is (for my line of work). I want to be able to meet with people on a regular basis to exchange ideas and to turn my visions into reality.

That's it. That would be ideal. Be based in the Bay for this upcoming decade with frequent traveling to Asia, and other parts of the world, while practicing Vipassana intensely - making Dhamma Santosa the primary lab for deeper truth seeking.

This is the foundation I want.

Milestones:
1. Move back to the Bay comfortably (with >= 500k in the bank) into a space that is quite aligned with seeking truth. Stay with no burn until then.
2. Do good work, and work up to designing and building a space fully optimized for seeking truth.

Way of life:
- Do not participate in any culture wars. Generally condemn any and all intentional causing of suffering of others and get on with your work.
- Do not waste any energy or effort trying to convince other people of the truths you see. Just publish and work with those sufficiently aligned - who see the big picture truths and are willing to correct me on the smaller truths. Be very cautious about who you choose to work with. Non-seekers of the truth are overly emotional and lack the balance required to effectively seek truth.
- Become much better about practicing noble speech: only discuss what is productive, ignore everything else, but not in a rude way (i.e. if friends are having an unproductive discussion, you can simply remain silent with a smile without disturbing their fun in any way. Silence with subtle smile is an effective middle path. In my experience Matt did this really well that evening at dinner at Chat Corner - he simply kept to himself with a gentle ease about him, without making those around him feel like he was intentionally silent, in fact, I don't think the others at the table even noticed. That's the art I want to perfect. I'm too talkative. I have a strong craving to interject with my thoughts, especially when I feel that someone is incorrect about something. But it's best to curb that feeling in most situations).
- I will simply silently, effectively, just go on with my work. That's it.

My craft:
- I want to become great at seeking truth, and communicating the truths that I see incredibly effectively. I will become an excellent communicator. That is my natural inclination.
