In yesterday's conversation with fam, I realized how much Thatha prioritized people - i.e. he had a deep intention to build and uplift community. That was a common undercurrent, and theme, throughout his life.

Which is also why this period of isolation has taken such a big toll on him.

I respect the way he lived his life. For sure.
