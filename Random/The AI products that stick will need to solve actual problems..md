The "AI" piece will have a purpose to solve a real problem. The AI in and of itself isn't that valuable, it's a commodity.

You need to tackle the problem. You just have a better tool to do so, but the fundamental rules of building products hasn't changed: you need to address an actual problem people have.

This is great.

And hence the writing. To think through the problem I'm going to tackle, and why I'm going to do so.

It needs time and effort to rise to the surface, but with consistent writing, publishing and discussing, it'll surely come to the surface. Amen.
