How to dissolve the ego at least temporarily through Samadhi and Panna.

You have an incredible set of tools at your disposal. Leverage them.

Jhana: directed thought.

You should hone the ability to **choose** whether to give a thought strength or to let it pass. You should build the muscle to control your attention, to be able to fix it on what you want, and sustain your attention there for as long as you want.

This is the most fundamental skill to develop, that will also reduce the negative impact of your ego on your life.
