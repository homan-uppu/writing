You have a narrow view of how to have impact: i.e. build a meaningful product, etc.

But the reality is, there are many dimensions to pursue. You need to focus on creating a movement, not a product. A movement aligned with the reality of how the world is changing.

A product may be a first step in this process. But, the more valuable contribution is to deliver a knowledge system, ideology, culture, that elevates people to be able to thrive in this new world.

That's the direction you need to be working towards. So yes, **treat the product as a small piece in the larger puzzle of creating value for humanity.** Don't lose sight of this bigger picture.

This is why I'm so obsessed with becoming better at writing. Without the ability to think well, and communicate ideas effectively, you can't execute this larger mission. And yes, you'll have to confront all your fears about opening up to the world. In addition to becoming a powerful writer, you'll also need to be an incredible orator, a great leader, and a better human being.

Focus on the fundamental transformation required to elevate yourself in all of those areas. This will require great effort.

That's the trajectory. Don't lose sight of it.

When you place the current steps in that grander vision, things start to make sense. Amen.

You basically need to uncover the truth about the world. To uncover the difference between our current understanding of how the world works, and the reality. Bridging that gap will be your life's work.
