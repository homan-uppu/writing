Publishing my writing. I'm not going to build until I have 7 essays I'm proud of. Without this set of essays, I won't allow myself to do anything else.

If it takes too long to create these, then fuck it I'll have to find a way to make some money as I sustain myself through this process. But, I simply cannot skip this writing phase. That much I'm convinced of. I'm going to be stubborn about this.

For each essay, I want to get feedback from people who's feedback I greatly respect. For the people you know, **just hop on a fucking call**. That's the most effective way. Block time on their calendars.
