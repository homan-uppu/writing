- Ashtanga yoga
- Pelvic floor exercises (do this after Ashtanga every evening).
- 20 mins strength training just before the one meal.
- Strict one meal a day. In the afternoon.
- Keto. (as much as possible, but more importantly: no rice, breads, sugars. Carbs in veggies OK).
- Minimal / no caffeine.

This is the combination that works. Nothing else will get there imo. The combination is what drives results.

It was no coincidence that my breakthrough came after 2 weeks of no caffeine and a relatively strict keto diet.

The solution is there, that's for sure. You must attack it from all angles.
