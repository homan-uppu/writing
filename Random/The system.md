What does Karthik 2.0 look like?
### Constraints
1. No frivolous content consumption at all. Must completely eliminate this kind of expression.
2. No music consumption during work (only consume music during breaks). Give your mind the space to concentrate.
3. Every moment must count.
4. Can't leave SF. This is where you're going to grind. This is where you're going to rise. Amen.
5. Minimal burn outside of rent, etc.
### Pre-requisites
- I need a cofounder of some sort. This path is too tough to do solo. Therefore, even if solo initially, I need to be continuously investing in finding collaborators / a cofounder. This is the only way.
### Mental state
1. **Balance**.
2. **Speed**: Make decisions quickly. Move fast. Bias towards action. High quality thinking and execution.
### Timeline

Get **initial traction** for this "AI Guide" angle: i.e. build a compelling v1 of an AI that represents some knowledge well and can guide you through it. Start with a niche. Get traction, and ideally revenue, from that niche angle before even considering generalizing.

Achieve "ramen profitability" quickly. As quickly as possible. Ideally, if you ever raise, it should be to scale, not to survive. That's incredibly important.
