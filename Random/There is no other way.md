There are no shortcuts. None. You must buckle up for the journey. You have to write. There's no better way to make sense of your thoughts and intuitions so that you focus on the right problems, in the right way.

You can't compare this with other paths. Just buckle down and write.

Before I jump into the next project (which I will soon enough), I want to think things through. I want to do the thinking, research, etc. up front so that I minimize market risk as much as possible. I will gladly deal with execution risk. I will no longer deal with an unnecessarily large market risk.

I'm going to take the Bezos, Kunal, Naval, Immad approach to building. The execution will be ruthless, but it will be founded on deep thinking, conversations, and systematic experimentation to validate.

Of course be careful not to go too overboard in that direction, you won't ship anything and will be out of money before you know it.

There's a balance to be struck. So focus on that.
