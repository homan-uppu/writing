I literally, literally can't concentrate. I need to do something that brings back the concentration. Absolutely.

Just do something for fun. Anything. Wow. Go back to writing another essay? Perhaps that's what I ought to do. I'm not sure about anything anymore. Wow.

This is absolutely, honestly out of hand. Lol.
