I'm observing a conversation next to me, and it's clear just how powerful writing is. I can basically skip most conversations and just get to the chase because everything I'd want to share is already in the writing.

I can already feel it: after publishing 7 essays I'm proud of, I'm confident the ball will roll. Amen.

I'm also confident about the strategy to grow network through outreach for feedback.

Thinking things through will make the company / product direction very clear brother. Amen.
