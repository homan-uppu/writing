I'm observing a conversation next to me, and it's clear just how powerful writing is. I can basically skip most conversations and just get to the chase because everything I'd want to share is already in the writing.

I can already feel it: after publishing 7 essays I'm proud of, I'm confident the ball will roll. Amen.
