The foundation is a strong Yoga + meditation practice + diet + Sila + Pranayama. I need a strong body and mind in order to thrive in this phase. And I'm going to build them.

Through writing, I'm going to craft my views about the world. In these views I'll clearly describe the most pressing problems that I see in this world, and how I think we ought to tackle them. On top of these views, I shall build the necessary systems to tackle these problems head on.

Amen.

This is the phase in which I formulate my thoughts. And they will be my weapons to create the world that I want to see become reality.
