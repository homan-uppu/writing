What's going on? It's as if you're completely checking out. WTF.

What happened brother? Seriously. What the fuck happened? Completely checked out of that entire session. It's as if you have just completely fucking wasted your time.

What's going on brother? I need to dig deep to break out of this habit pattern of my mind. A terrible pattern that's been going on for my entire life.

I didn't have this mind when I was younger, that's for sure. Yeah. When I played Halo, I really fucking played Halo. There was nothing else on my mind back then.

Complete absorption and obsession.

I had that as well with basketball for a good few years.  A solid few years.

But since then, I've fallen to the wayside. Unable to stick to things for a long period of time (except for meditation).

I need to look at myself in the mirror and ask the tough questions: what is it that I want to become? What is my purpose? Without this clarity, I'm a lost soul wandering around, living a life without meaning.

Only when I have clarity can I direct my mind to climb the mountain that I want to climb.

I'm sorely lacking at the moment. And I feel helpless. Hopeless. It's not a good feeling at all.

What happened? Where did I go wrong? Why don't I have the creativity that I'm usually tingling with?

Hits or flops, I ought to be able to take the next step with force. I seem to have lost that ability.

I'm in a dangerous, poisonous state of mind. It's actually quite terrible where I've ended up.

I don't have a foundation to use for momentum. I have absolutely no successes under my belt that would even warrant someone wanting to chat with me. I have nothing.

I don't have money to sustain myself. I'm pretty much broke. Borrowing money to make ends meet.

I'm annoyed. I'm distraught. And for the first time, I'm terrified of what I'm going to become if I don't turn things around right now.

I have an incredible opportunity. But I lack the commitment required to create value.

I fall into the same patterns of failure. Every failure looks the same. Every limbo period more painful than the one that came before.

I keep getting in my way.

I'm failing to live up to my potential. I'm failing to become a leader. If I don't turn my life around, this entire, precious, human life will be a waste.

It's time to roll up my sleeves and deliver. There are many people that are banking on me. I must deliver. I can't let people down. I can't let myself down.

Everything comes down to a choice. What is it that I'm going to do? How am I going to rise?

I have a platform. A voice. Yet, I have nothing to say.

What's the point of a platform and a voice if you don't take advantage of it?

Why does your body language wreak of defeat?

Why have you already given up before you've even swung?

You're meant to be a warrior, but you're little more than a walking corpse at the moment. A shell of your potential.

The content consumption trap is real. You're exhausting your energy by continuously consuming crap content for the mind. What the flying fuck.

Will you learn to channel your energies productively? Or will you wither away?

Strict OMAD from here on out. Absolutely. 100%. Amen.

If I had a buttload of money, what would I do right now? I'd spend a year doing Yoga, meditation, writing, excellent diet, living close to nature. And that's it. I'd build a strong foundation of personal health. I'd build a powerful mind. That's it. I wouldn't need anything more than that.

But, you have to earn that opportunity. You're in debt and can't pursue that path right now. You need to be able to build a practice, a discipline, in the midst of war as well. That's the only path you have right now.
