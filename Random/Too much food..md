I ate way too much today and I'm paying the price.
In addition to the food, I drank coffee which is significantly messing with my pelvic floor system.

I need to avoid making this problem from here on out. This is going to kill my ability to work. It's taken more than a couple of hours to fully recover from that. Sigh...
