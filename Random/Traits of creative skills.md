(This is the most important, challenging section of this essay. Need to nail it. Amen.)

1. Creative skills follow a power law distribution.
2. Creative skills resist standardized assessments.
3. It's tough to predict how long it takes to become competent at a creative skill.
	1. Only syntax can be learned on a timeline, yet the more creative the skill the less useful knowledge of syntax is on its own.
	2. For non-creative skills that have standardized assessments, you can accurately predict that with a certain amount of training you should be able to gain competence in its syntax.
	3. That doesn't hold for creative skills. When syntax alone won't enable you to create value, 

As a result pay-to-learn doesn't scale to train creative skills. The lack of predictability on how long it takes to develop competence means that the expected value of an education program is too low to justify paying up front fees.

Therefore expected value of outcomes in a fixed time period is too low to justify paying any sort of up front fee unless you have money you can lose and be OK.

Which is why pay-to-learn ed-tech platforms (MOOCs, bootcamps, etc.) have shifted their focus towards company employees who get their employers to pay for courses, and those that have a financial buffer - once again those who are already working.

Can you drive up the quality of the education with better teachers?

They can't target the masses because the masses can't afford to pay when the expected value of the education is low.

You can't raise the price of the education and attract the best because that only increases the prices and
