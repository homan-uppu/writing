These are quite compelling, and I see tremendous value in working on both.

The reality is that both of these are pieces of a larger mission: how to train minds to thrive in our world. Ability to seek truth and communicating well are both part of [[The skills that matter]].

This is it. The path is so clear. My writing will quite literally help me uncover this. 7 essays, and then the mission statement. Amen.
