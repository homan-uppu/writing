Operate from a state of mind that isn't attached to the results. That doesn't tie its identity with the outcomes.

That tying identity leads to too many problems in execution because it makes the stakes for every decision (on what to work on) too high. You end up overthinking it.

It's OK to sweat the details on the design. But over-thinking the big picture before you've even hit reality (i.e. shipped something to actual users) holds you back greatly.

You need bias towards action: i.e. shipping actual products to people, in order to have a foundation that you can iterate on. But when you overthink the big picture, you get lost and misguided by your ego because it keeps playing future scenarios and tries to see if it will "feel good" in those scenarios. The fact is that the ego will NEVER feel good in any of the scenarios, and therefore letting your mind analyze future scenarios without shipping a product to users in the short-term, is just stupid.

So yes, I'm going to operate from a mental state of vairagya: dispassion towards the results. The result of this company will not impact my self-worth. I will act freely with the sole aim of making something useful for the world, putting aside the cravings of my ego to "be something".

Alrighty, let's get this!

I'm excited for (lol) this dispassionate approach. Just framing it like this is so freeing. My sense of self-worth isn't going to go on the rollercoaster that it's been on for the past few years. I can feel it. I'm going to aggressively drop my desires to "be something".

I'm already everything I need to be. There is no more becoming. Just do you. That's it.
