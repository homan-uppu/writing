Definitely need to operate faster.
I need to bounce from this environment, and this city even, ASAP.

But actually.

I think it's time to bring on an absurd grind. The kind that will result in escape velocity.

Be clear. Be focused. And attack it hard. Really fucking hard. It's time.

Dissatisfied with the current living environment. I mean, you always are though, so is this anything new?

No, there is something new here. Have there been **ANY spots** that you were OK with? That's the real question. None. That's the truth. Every single place had some compromise or the other. That's the nature of the human mind, nothing more.

Yeah. This is an interesting feeling. For sure.

I made a mistake rooming with someone, that's for sure. But, at the same time, it's enabled me to live in a clean, nice place. Definitely important. Even if I'm paying double what I paid in Chinatown, I think it's worth it. Chinatown-style living isn't healthy.

What's the ideal? Well, there is no ideal, that's the truth. The vision you had the other day about creating that kind of productive, social, environment in Hyderabad is a powerful vision. I think it can make sense for sure.

Well, it's clear what the most productive angle is: to focus on the present moment - look to achieve escape velocity. A ruthless exercise of will. Against all odds. Make it happen. A more bold attack this time around. Rigorous grind, but with ease: such that you can sustain this for long periods of time. 

Sustained samadhi is what will lead to results my friend. Sustained. And concentrated.

The visual storytelling angle is powerful. And that's definitely where you're going to "play".

Going to build a team this time around. For sure. That's an important step in this direction.

This first month is critical: it'll give you the clarity to have an execution plan for the next 6 months. Absolutely. You can't go super hard for too long without some sort of fixed longer-term angle.

Actually fuck that. Ship, iterate, pivot if need be. Extremely quickly. Without attachment.

This is the phase. This is the time to shine. Absolutely. Life is going to be radically changed for the better over upcoming 6 months. Done.
