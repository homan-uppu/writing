I want to work with others. I'm tired of this isolation that comes from working alone. I want to make it a priority to get to a collaboration phase.

I want to be a part of a community that I respect. Ideally one centered around the path and practice, but also worldly in the ways that I am (i.e. creating something for the world).

I believe that combination exists (people similarly at the intersection that I'm at), and I want to connect with them.

Some of my best memories have been in serving courses alongside others practicing, and sitting with them 3 times a day during our service.

Unforgettable. For the first time I felt that I was a part of a community that I belonged to: of everyday, normal people, looking to better themselves.

I also want to live closer to family. Not in the exact same house obviously, but I want to be close enough such that I can see them at least once a week. Ideally for a little bit every day / or even a little bit every few days.

I really like how Akshar's place is set up: grandmas can just walk on over to each others' flats in a way that's so natural.

It's that family, community, people, environment that I crave right now. I think it's incredibly beneficial for my mind, and I want to create such an environment for people to swing by to.

Unless I'm at an Ashram / a center dedicated to practicing, I want a space that I have greater control over. I want to have a dedicated space to sit, such that only sitting takes place in that room. I want functions to be separated: sleep, work, dining, sitting, Yoga, should all be in separate spaces that are uniquely dedicated for that purpose.

I want an independent home with an ample backyard space. I want it to embody nature. A garden even.

That's the space I want to create. I'm not sure where that would be, but it can really only be in: Hyderabad / Banglore / Bay Area. Out of which I'd think it would have to be in either Hyd / the Bay area. Those are the only places where I have a base. And even in that, I think Hyderabad is where most of my fam is and I feel a sense of responsibility towards that city in a way: I want to give back somehow.

Giving back comes in various layers: first to my immediate friends, family and acquaintances, and then expand beyond that.

Re. work - I similarly want to have control over the space (and have it in-person as much as possible). The Airbnb office, RGV den, studio Ghibli etc. are good inspirations. A space to combine technology and storytelling in a unique way.

With a fixed space, partner, and high level direction, I want to focus on building a rhythm. Every effort in all areas of my life need to compound.

And as I continue to build rhythm and compounding returns in my external life, I will continue to invest in deepening my practice with a yearly course (which will eventually become a yearly long course - hopefully sitting a 30 day course per year within the next 5 years).

Once I get to 40, I want to be spending at least 3 months a year sitting. The more power you gain, the more important it is to deepen your understanding and mastery over yourself, so that you can apply that power in a way that benefits humanity.

This is my aspiration. This is what I want to build.

Execute with great concentration. Make your mind as sharp as a freshly crafted katana.
