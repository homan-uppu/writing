Standardization is a one size fits all approach: the same teaching curriculum, the same pace, roughly the same course duration, and a similar sort of standardized test to assess competence with clear right and wrong answers to make it easy to grade and scale this type of education.

This kind of education and competence evaluation works well for non-creative skills, but fails to train competence in a creative skill.

To show why, 



----

- Standardized teaching: One size fits all: fixed curriculum, fixed pace, fixed duration, skill assessed through tests with clear "right" and "wrong" answers to make it easy to grade and scale the education to everyone.
- Standardized test are insulated from the market. For example: getting an A on a test doesn't correlate with actual skill to create value in the market.
	- E.g. you could get an A on a musical notation class and still fail to create music that people appreciate.
	- E.g. you could get an A in a programming language class, and still fail to build software that people will use / pay for.
- Standardization works well for non-creative skills because inputs correlate with output: if you learn the rules of how to do X, then you can become competent at doing X. When the learning clearly translates to competence, it's possible to design a fixed curriculum that teaches X.
- The only thing you can test with a standardized test is knowledge of syntax, not true competence. Only the market can gauge true competence. (It's often even difficult for a master of a creative skill to accurately identify true competence).
- The problem with standardized education and assessment is that standardized tests can be done by computers far better than humans. So if you optimize learning for a standardized test, you're building skills that technology will invalidate quickly.

Need a better definition here. I'm failing to grasp the essence. 

**Why do creative skills resist standardization?**

Let's take a different angle here:
1. You can learn syntax in a standardized way: e.g. the rules of the game. Solving puzzles, understanding theory.

"Prove" this by working backwards:

If you can standardize it, it cannot assess creative skill. Why? Let's work backwards to see this. Inherently a standardized assessment means that there's a notion of the right answer and a wrong answer. That's a necessary feature of a standardized assessment because otherwise, it would be impossible to grade it fairly for everyone, and impossible to scale the assessment affordably.

Anything with a clearly defined right and wrong answer means that it can be trained for in a methodical way. Most people with the right training and enough time will be able to crack it.

And importantly, computers will be able to do it better than we can because AI will be able to do anything with a clearly defined right and wrong answers through training with examples. (https://openai.com/research/gpt-4).

(TODO: paste the standardized exam results of AI).

Put another way: technology increases the value of competence in a creative skill, and reduces the value of knowing just the syntax of the creative skill.
