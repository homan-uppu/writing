How do we build a better learning system that cultivates the mind that can thrive in a world with a high bar for creativity? How can we scale it?

I see three promising directions to explore. I'm going to only briefly touch on each idea in this essay, and publish a longer essay treatment for each later.

**1. Enable investing in individuals**

The first is to change the business model of teaching towards investing in individuals, rather than charging a tuition in exchange for knowledge.

We saw earlier why a pay-to-learn model can't effectively train competence for a creative skill. On the other hand, if it's possible to invest in an individual: to be able to give them money, training, personalized feedback in exchange for equity in their future outcomes, then masters have the incentive to train.

We already see this investing model dominate creative fields such as startups / filmmaking / music, etc, and it's the only model that makes sense for creative skills due to the power law nature of outcomes.

Being able to invest in an individual creates a market for their potential. It incentivizes identifying promising talent early and helping them nurture their talent.

There are people that do this today: e.g coaches that train superstar athletes when they're young, etc.

But for most creative skills today, those that identify and nurture talent aren't rewarded for their efforts. They often do it out of a passion for the skill, a sense of responsibility and desire to give back to the next generation.

I have great respect for such people, but unfortunately, benevolence doesn't scale. By rewarding training people with equity, there will be a lot more activity trying to identify promising talent and train them.

And importantly, equity is the only way to adequately compensate a master. As we saw above, a pay-to-learn model can never compensate a master of a craft enough to justify them offering personalized feedback to train a student - because their time is too valuable.

But, if they had equity in their students' outcomes, those students that win will win big (due to power law), and will more than compensate for master's time spent on all students.

The equity model also incentives a master to publish their knowledge for free, to the entire world because by sharing their knowledge with the world, they'll attract the talent that they can then filter to identify the best ones to invest in.

With this investing model, as skills become more creative, I predict we'll see many "accelerators" that operate in the way a startup accelerator does, but for all kinds of skills (e.g. engineers, designers, builders, filmmakers, etc.)

But the devil is in the details. What does it mean to "invest" in an individual? Investing in a business is clear: you invest and as the company is valued more (based on perceived ability to generate long-term revenue), the value of your equity increases.

What does that mean for an individual? Does it mean that you have the right to invest in any business they start in the future at a discounted price? How do you ground what a person is "valued" in reality: the value they create in the world? What will be the role of regulation in this? How do we deter fraudulent activity (a person saying they've created something when they didn't, in order to create hype and be invested in).

**2. AI to scale personalized feedback**



**3. Policy changes that gives people more choice in learning paths.**
