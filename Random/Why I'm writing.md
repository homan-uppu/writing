Before jumping into the next experiment, I want to ensure that I've thought it through better. I want a more rigorously tested foundation to build on. I see great value in taking the time to distill my intuitions in essays, and then use that writing as the foundation to build a compelling product for the world.

I want clarity of thought. This doesn't mean that I won't build without any risk, but any risk I take will be intentional. I'll write out all the risks associated with my experiment, and I'll continue to update my understanding by actually building.

Writing also gives me the space to be more ambitious. When I have the space to see and edit my thinking, with a more balanced mind I can nudge it to be more ambitious and long-term oriented. 

The strategy and design phase of a product are critical. I haven't given this phase enough importance in my previous endeavors, and I strongly believe that's what led to my failures. I don't have the privilege to fail anymore. I have to get it right this time. And so I'm changing up my process here in a way that I believe will lead to the results that I want.
