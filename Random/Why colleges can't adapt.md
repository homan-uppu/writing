Economics don't work out for the exact reason they don't work for software engineering bootcamps: you can't reliably train competence for a creative skill in a fixed time, without having masters educating students.

Despite its inefficacy, going to college is still the **primary, aspirational path** for the billion young people around the world. What gives?

The rising bar for creativity means that there can't be a low-risk, clear path to competence that will enable you to create value in this world.

In the absence of viable alternatives, people will continue doing what they've always done with the hope that because college worked in the past to land a job, it'll continue to work today.

But a system can't be so disconnected from reality and hope to live for long. Reckoning will come sooner or later. The higher education bubble will burst.

I do still see a role for elite colleges, and I think they'll be around for a while. But they educate less than 1% of the world's youth, so in a way it's useless.

Elite colleges are where much of humanity's long-term scientific research is carried out. We'll continue to invest a bit of our resources into long-term research. But even from a long-term research perspective, I suspect there are better models for it. The nature of publish-or-perish research environment incentivizes incremental research over working towards massive breakthroughs.

Similarly, colleges for skills that are heavily regulated (medicine, law, certain types of engineering) will continue to have demand because regulation insulates these skills from market and technological forces.

Perhaps due to the higher bar for creativity and the uncertainty that comes with that, more people will choose regulated skills that have greater certainty. It isn't easy, but at least you can predict that if you invest $X into an education and work your ass off, the results will arrive within a certain time period.
