But, there's no other way. Lol.

And running away to someplace else isn't going to help either. You can't run from your own mind. You simply have to persist and move forward with this. Absolutely.

Where do you want to work out of? Why isn't home working? What's stopping you from grinding out your writing here? What's stopping you? (My own mind). Lol.

I also don't need caffeine in any form right now. I have enough in my system already. Just drink lots of water.

In that case, what's the point of going? There is none. You ought to stay here, without any connection to the internet, without any distractions whatsoever, and just grind. But tbh, I do find it much easier to grind in public, and I'm not sure why. Maybe that's because of the social pressure to not goof off? Maybe that's a part of it. I'm not sure.
