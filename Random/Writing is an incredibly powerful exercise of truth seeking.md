The most powerful one that I've found.
There is great value in engaging the conscious with the subconscious. I need to explore why this is so, but so far it's been an illuminating process.

Writing and thinking things through also gives you the space, and opportunity rather, to be more ambitious. I can't imagine having an extremely ambitious idea without sufficient truth seeking.

I'm also now convinced now that in order to build a successful team, the primary filter ought to be the quality of truth seeking that I can observe in a written memo of sorts.

A piece of writing itself has the capacity to tell you so much about a person and whether they're capable of executing well. Why? Because execution is increasingly just about seeking truth well.

These are powerful truths that I see about the world that is going to impact how I choose who to work with. Absolutely. And this is an exciting feeling.

Who could have thought that the process of stringing together characters in some language can have such a profound impact on the way the author, and their audience, feels. This is a beautiful process.

This is the process to stick to until I see another course of actions to take. Powerful.

And, I'm greatly enjoying the process, meaning I have sufficient patience to do great work. Just keep at it. One thought at a time. One word at a time. One moment at a time.
