- **Creativity is eating the world**: take the section from this essay and expand on it. More examples, and a clear definition of the consequences of this shift with convincing evidence.
- **AI copilots** - expand on the "promising directions" section of the essay by doubling down on copilots: what are these, and how they can be powerful aids in learning that scales.
- **Build irrefutable proof of competence**. Make this generic: a designer, engineer, PM / anyone should be able to read this and gain clarity on what proof is, and how to go about building it.
- **Becoming 10^n**. Not a relative measure, make it an absolute value to aspire to. Lay out the entire game plan to do so. Excruciating detail. With plenty of reading / watching resources. You basically want to lay out a plan for the hungry, ambitious 18 year old in the world that's about to start a crap college program. This is to **inform them** what the world is like, and to arm them with a framework to build irrefutable proof of competence.

This is a lot of work. Especially looking at my current pace. If I don't increase velocity, I can't complete these in time. I do have a timeline pressure here. Need to grind harder.

After this, I want to identify the most important skill to develop, and then build an AI + curated knowledge + community learning system around it.

That is the way to go. Aim to scale quality education to the world. Don't accept anything less than that. Amen.

With this mission and an initial plan, build a world-class founding team and go off to the races. Amen. You likely can't reach scale quickly. But, the goal would be to do so eventually: in the upcoming years. You need a solid plan to do so. Amen.

Through this process of writing, you ought to build the network you need in order to launch the subsequent project well. Amen.

Writing will lay the foundation. Don't be fixed on the path. The writing process is to clarify the mission. The path will take time to uncover. Don't be fixed on anything. The path might require writing / content creation / product experimentation / anything. I'm not sure at the moment. It might take time to craft this. Take the necessary time. Rushing it isn't going to help. Zestful ease.
