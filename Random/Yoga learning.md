Hatha Yoga Pradipika -> need to feed ancient wisdom to an LLM and have it spit out a content feed. That would be powerful. Seems quite comprehensive.

### Diet
1. One meal a day. Lentils, spinach should be more than enough. You don't need as much protein, etc. as doctors prescribe these days. You have at least 20 lbs (9 kgs) to drop so weight isn't even a concern. Go hard on OMAD and it should serve you well. But you should never break it. This diet is as key as the asanas, pranayamas, bandhas, etc. The diet is the foundation.
### Breathing during asanas

### Pranayama
Krishnamacharya was quite particular about pranayama being the most powerful exercise you can do for health. I ought to practice this after Ashtanga practice.
### Bandhas

I definitely need to learn more about these. There's definitely something powerful to be unlocked by understanding the bandhas and employing them correctly. Do the research.
