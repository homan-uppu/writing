These are the cards you're dealt with. You have to aggressively fight back. Amen.

I think the running will be a great help. Mix up the running. Daily doesn't have to be too far, but once a week get that super long run in.

It's time to reclaim my health. These last 3 years haven't been kind. I have to be far more disciplined to get the results I want.

Can do a 5 mile run in the mornings (first thing), and Ashtanga in the late afternoons with an hour sit in the aft. This would be a reasonable start until you bring the weight down - to somewhere around 180. (i.e. down 15 pounds). Amen.
