A single mooncake and hojicha tea w/ almond milk. It filled my stomach 50%. That's all I need for the rest of the day.

When you start OMAD tomorrow, don't pig out on the meal. Make sure to only fill the stomach half way. Fill a quarter with water. And leave a quarter empty. Ancient systems have already figured out the optimal health. There's no need to fuck around with this system. Amen.

6 - 8 eggs. Some spinach salad. And that's it for a few days. And then figure out a quick InstaPot process to whip up a tasty, and healthy single meal for the day. Amen.
