It's really fucking holding you back.

When you feel you're in a rat race, the game becomes competitive, and it fuels your ego.

When you don't assign your self-worth to your "position" in some arbitrary game, you don't fuel your ego and can genuinely open up to, and support others on their paths without envy.

This is the key, fundamental shift you need to make in order to be a better human.

Start reaching out to more people to thank them. To ask for feedback, to contribute. Be helpful. Genuinely. Wow.
