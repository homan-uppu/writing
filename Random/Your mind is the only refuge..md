- City life in India doesn't appeal to me whatsoever.
- I'm definitely not a fan of the Bay Area.
- I'm craving to be in an East Asian city, but I'm also sure that won't meet my "expectations" for long.

There is no "perfect place" in the world. Every single place, every single culture has its pros and cons.

Though, I can say that a systematic life in India - likely in some suburb in Banglore, gets closest to the ideal.

Someplace in nature. Close to the ocean (for sure that would be ideal), or at least a large river. Some body of water.

But yeah, I can already feel everything getting "old". That's the nature of the mind: it keeps craving something "new". Some change or the other. That's just how the mind works unfortunately. That's why social feeds are so damn addicting: a constant feed of "new"ness that the mind craves.

This craving for newness is what led humans to explore the world. It's what led us to create new tools, art, content, etc. We crave change.

But at the same time we fear too much change. Or rather, change that is out of our control. Or even: we fear change in the ways that we don't want things to change.

Hilarious.

But one thing is clear: I definitely don't want to step foot in Europe if I can avoid it. That's the absolute last place I'd want to be.

East Asia: Singapore, Tokyo, Seoul.

The reality is: I want to travel around the world. A nomadic lifestyle, except I'm just traveling to a bunch of places in the world (outside of the West as much as possible - go to the right people no matter where they are in the world... that's the way to do this).

You have to understand that there are incredibly distraught, sad people everywhere - especially in developed countries where you have to do a lot more in order to just be able to survive.

This capitalistic machine gives you a greater opportunity for happiness and inner peace, but at the same time it makes building the happiness generating habits more difficult. That's for sure. And since the bar for work to create value is higher, people have to suffer a lot more in order to just get by.

It's not surprising that depression rates are way higher in developed countries, as well as rich cities in the developing world as well.

**People need**:
- Community
- Purpose
- Health (e.g. a lot tougher to be happy when you're obese)
- Baseline financial wellbeing: so that you're not worrying about paying rent, or eating your next meal.
- The right philosophy: 
	- You have to treat life as a single player game and stop all the comparison with others - which is simply futile.
	- You need to be able to surrender the illusion of control. - Most external things in the world are not in your hands. Don't be attached to a foundation that simply doesn't exist.
- Practices: some routine that concentrates the mind. Mindfulness. Can come through work, creating art, meditation, whatever. The goal is to be able to concentrate the mind in a single direction for a period of time. Keeping the mind in the present moment is healthier for it which is why you need to directly train that skill..
- Something to keep busy with. Incredibly difficult for a wandering, stagnant mind to be happy. It needs to be put to work towards something.

Amen.

How to build these things in my own life?

Most are clear to me except for community. That's the one that I have to spend the most time to craft. What does the right community even mean? How can I connect with people who care about the things that I care about? Hmm... I'm not entirely sure. I do think the internet will have to facilitate the connections because I want to be intentional about who to connect with. This is why publishing my thinking is so important. Amen.
