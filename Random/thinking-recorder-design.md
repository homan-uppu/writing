# Thinking recorder app

I want to have a tool that helps me record my thoughts without the anxious editing: i.e. backspacing, removing because I feel like that thought isn't "good enough".

I want to capture the raw, unedited version of myself, and THEN process it to get the final form that I want.

I censor too much.

(Need to flesh this train of thought out.)

I'm hoping this tool can help me create more than I consume.

There's also value in a "share" feature. To send a note to others.
