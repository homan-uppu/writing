### Sila
(Not going to break it this time. Absolutely not.)
- 
### Diet
(High quality, low carb, high fat, some protein diet that shouldn't aggravate SIBO / SIFO in any way. And strictly OMAD).

This one is really tough. I'm craving for some kind of hot drink that I can sip as I write. Is that too much to ask for? It sadly is. You can't have anything. You need to stick to OMAD.

I had chamomile with heavy cream (dairy) and it didn't help gut.

### Yoga
(Every single day except for scheduled moon days).

- 9/5/23
