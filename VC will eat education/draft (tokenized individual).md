the more powerful ai becomes, the more invalid our education systems become. not necessarily because of *what* they're teaching, but rather because of the underlying business model of education which is to exchange money for an education that is supposed to enable you to build a career and recoup your investment and then some.

as ai becomes more powerful, outcomes become more skewed, becoming more winner-takes all.












- Crafting your **own unique learning path** will be the best education you can receive. grounded in learning, in the real world.
- Our education systems don't work in the age of intelligence.
- Our schools pump out too many individuals that want to do the same thing. We don't need a million young, capable minds obsessing over, say, becoming a consultant.
- We don't have a system that allows for greater experimentation.
- We should be able to invest in individuals by giving them money in exchange for equity in all the things that they will create / own in the future.
- We'll need such an instrument to enable greater individual experimentation, to allow individuals to carve their own learning paths, and not be forced into the mass education programs that fail to train truly independent individuals (who can think for themselves).
