### problem
rapid progression of AI is going to pose serious problems for how the world works; specifically how our education system works.

most people with today's standard education aren't going to be useful in a world with intelligent agents that can translate our ideas into reality quickly. i'm not going to explore what the "right education" is to thrive in the age of intelligence because there's a bigger problem: we lack the right incentives to even have a great education system.

- something about starting much earlier.
- why pay-to-learn learning programs fail to scale.

**specifically, the business model of paying to learn no longer works in today's world.** 

first let's see why this business model is invalid, and then we can explore what a better set of incentives looks like, and finally, how we can implement them.
### ai increases leverage
### leverage makes power law distribution of outcomes more extreme

### making a living will become more difficult for most.
- because we constantly redefine what "living" means. as we invent better technologies, older ways of living feel archaic, barbaric, and morally problematic.
- paradox: world becomes better for most, yet everyone feels that they're falling behind.
### investing in individuals
- a system that benefits from greed, not compassion.
### next steps
