Truths are valuable. And truths just happen to be secrets not because people are hiding them, but because even if you share them with the world with a loudspeaker, very few will actually believe you.

And getting the attention of people that believe you is more valuable than harmful because it means you get valuable feedback, you discover people you can collaborate with.

Like with most things, this wasn't always the case in the past. The degree to which secrets are valuable depends on how much leverage is available in the world, and to you.

And we're at a point in the state of the world in which most of us are under-optimized on how transparent we ought to be. Run the thought experiment: if you all of a sudden made public all of your internal docs, what do you think would happen?

(OK, the more I write about this, the less convinced of it I am. Because if this were true, wouldn't most open source companies be winning? That is far from the case. In fact, I think total transparency only makes sense much, much later. So where exactly are we in this curve?)
