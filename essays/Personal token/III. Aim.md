### Democratize opportunity

Our aim is to democratize opportunity.

Personal tokens create the economic incentives to accelerate us towards a world in which every individual has the resources to discover and realize their potentials.

To be clear, this shift has already been happening. While there is still significant inequality of opportunity in the world today, there has not been a better period in human history for someone with little. Most can access troves of knowledge through their smartphones, internet, and now through AI. Innovations in technology promise us a world in which everyone has access to powerful tools to learn and to turn their ideas into reality.

Yet, democratizing access to tools alone doesn't sufficiently democratize opportunity. Individuals require capital *(and often guidance & community)* to be able to have the space to explore, tinker, discover their innate potentials and to realize them. 

Most people intuitively understand that putting capital in the hands of young people that they can use to finance their learning & exploration will lead to greater long-term prosperity for all. But, we consistently fail to transfer sufficient capital to the hands of young people.

Why is that? Those who hold power to allocate such capital: the rich (who can give money from their pockets), and the old (who determine political outcomes in the developed world), have no incentive to transfer wealth to the young to fuel their growth.

Grants, scholarships, public policies to transfer capital to the hands of young people rely on goodwill - on the benevolence of individuals - because they don't directly benefit the old and the rich (aside from some public status brownie points for "doing good").

Benevolence doesn't scale because it usually manifests as a weak, fleeting, inconsistent emotion. To see why, we simply have to look at our own minds. How often do each of us actually act out of a feeling of goodwill for collective happiness and prosperity? Even when we do feel such goodwill, it's usually fleeting. And often when we think it's goodwill, it's actually something far more selfish (craving for status, recognition, etc.).

It's foolish to rely on goodwill to democratize opportunity.

Personal tokens create a direct relationship between the future prosperity of others and your own. Future rewards from investing in young people with potential are no longer blurry, they are clear: invest $x today in someone and if they create 1000x value in the world, you directly profit significantly. These profits aren't blurry. It won't be filtered through a massive centralized government structure that eats up most of it before it ends up in the infrastructure that you use... it comes straight into your wallet.

Personal tokens incentivize investing in young people who have potential - out of the desire for future profits, not out of goodwill.

There is no force more powerful than greed. Greed is anti-fragile: we are greedy in bad times and even more greedy during good times. Greed is consistent: you can always bet on greed. Greed scales. For every person donating to a scholarship (or grant) program out of goodwill, there will be thousands who would invest (and invest more) in an individual out of the desire for profits.

### Growth

Still, even with the right incentives, opportunity will not be democratized all of a sudden in one swoop. Even if every single person with the skills and potential to create value in the world today gains access to the resources they need to realize their potential, we can't deny that there is still great inequality of opportunity in the learning environments of children. How will we bridge that opportunity gap?

I see democratization of opportunity happening in two phases:
1. **Efficiency**: capital is allocated to overlooked talent who already exist in the world.
2. **Expansion**: capital is allocated towards high quality learning environments for all children to increase overall number of talented individuals who can be invested in down the line.

Phase 2 will start once the talent market is sufficiently efficient and prosperous. The investors who generate strong returns will become more ambitious, and will allocate more capital towards expansion in order to increase the number of talented individuals they can invest in.

Therefore, we accelerate democratization of opportunity by optimizing for economic growth: maximizing the number of personal tokens in the Network, and their valuations. Growth leads to prosperity, which raises ambitions, which will push capital towards bridging opportunity gaps in childhood because that is the final frontier for investors to maximize their long-term returns.

*note: Of course, there's a limit to how far we can push equal opportunity. Even if we make access to the best resources available to all, we wouldn't want to change the underlying genetic differences that make each of us unique - which give some of us "unfair" advantages over others. But, we can at least get a glimpse of what those innate advantages are, which is only possible when all other advantages are democratized.*

### Trust

Trust is the foundation for growth. 

Users in the Network must trust that:
1. their ownership of other personal tokens will be honored forever, that they won't wake up one day to find that the system has collapsed taking their wealth with it.
2. the information they obtain on the Network that they use to make decisions is accurate and true (aligned with reality).

For the Network to last, it must be implemented well (in all ways: legal, technological, etc.), and be sufficiently decentralized to minimize the chance of stupidity (either from an individual or authority) to kill it. (I will cover this in in the "Governance" and "Implementation" chapters).

To understand why trust in information is so important, we need to see how lies kill the Network.

In the Network, misrepresentation can be in the following ways:
1. Saying you are who you're not.
2. Saying you've accomplished things that you actually haven't.
3. Saying you want to do something with the capital you will raise without actually having the intention to do it.
4. Omitting some (or all) of your ownership of companies outside of the Network.
  
Each form of misrepresentation has a likely cause. Those who don't identify themselves accurately are likely trying shed the burden of their poor track record, or history of actions that hurt their chances to raise capital. Those who bloat what they've accomplished, or tell ambitious stories of how they'll use capital raised without intending to spend it that way are trying to cheat investors out of money. Those who omit their ownership of companies outside of the Network are likely trying to skip paying the appropriate share of capital gains to their personal token shareholders when they sell equity in companies outside of the Network.

Naturally there are varying degrees to fraud: some misrepresentations are far more harmful than others. It's also possible to make accidents. Intention matters.

The best way to dis-incentivize fraud is to:
1. Ensure users of the Network have high ambition.
2. Effectively tarnish the reputation of bad actors.

Sufficient ambition is a necessary pre-requisite to minimizing fraud because the possibility of a tarnished reputation alone doesn't dis-incentivize an individual from acting fraudulently if they're not ambitious.

Ambitious individuals operate on long-time horizons and understand that a strong reputation is critical for them to achieve their goals. _(note: by reputation I don't mean being liked by others, but rather being seen as an individual who doesn't lie, does what they say they will, honors commitments and generally is a person of strong integrity.)_ Therefore, a Network in which all users are genuinely highly ambitious will naturally have far, far less fraud than one with moderate / low ambition users.

 A Network of personal tokens that simply facilitates transactions (buying and selling equity in personal tokens) won't work without the necessary auxiliary functions that minimize fraud and cultivate ambition & trust.
