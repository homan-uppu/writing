### Goal

So far we've covered the core functionality of the Network as well as the auxiliary functions required to build, maintain, and support a Network of personal tokens and their transactions.

**Core functionality:**
1. Facilitating transactions: buying / selling equity in personal tokens.

**Auxiliary functions to enable a Network of users:**
- Admission: how users join the Network.
- Tackling fraud / reputation.
- Discovery: connecting investors with individuals they'd want to invest in.
- Build and maintain: implement Network, build features, and ensure everything is functioning correctly.

We now need to think about how power over these functions is distributed. Who will be performing these functions and how do we ensure that these functions will be executed optimally, and sustainably for the foreseeable future.

And even before that we need to understand what we're optimizing for.

### Sufficient decentralization

### Aligning incentives

### Promoting competition

### Governance
