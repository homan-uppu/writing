A personal token is a financial instrument that represents an individual's economic potential.

Similar to how companies issue shares to raise capital, individuals can raise capital by selling shares in their person token to investors. These shareholders become entitled to a proportional share of capital gains when the personal token owner sells their equity in companies or other personal tokens. In other words, a personal token's value is grounded in its owner's stakes in companies and other personal tokens.

Personal tokens incentivize discovering and enabling talent - especially the kind of talent that is underrated and overlooked. **Therefore, personal tokens create the economic incentives to democratize opportunity.**

Personal tokens enable high-potential individuals to raise capital to fund their ambitious projects and learning, much earlier in their careers, and without taking on debt (which is the most common way to fund learning today in the US). Taking on debt burdens the mind and hampers an individual's ability to pursue their dreams, whereas selling equity in future outcomes enables an individual to dream big by sharing their risk with people willing to bet on them.

In this paper I've attempted to show how I see personal tokens working, and how to implement them. This is a very early draft. I'd appreciate your feedback.
