Seeking truth is the most fundamental processes for any living being. How well you can seek truth determines whether you will be able to get what you want out of life.

This essay, or rather collection of essays, describes my beliefs about seeking truth, and indirectly, describes my understanding of how the universe and the human mind work. My purpose isn’t to convince you of anything. I’m sharing my beliefs to give you a better mental model of how and why I operate the way I do. To make me more predictable - which is important to be able to productively work together. Therefore, unless you’re going to work with me in some shape or form (or already are), you’re probably wasting your time reading this.

These aren’t really scientific claims with proofs and evidence by any means, but more like conjectures. And, as you’ll soon see, many of my claims can’t be disproven with the technologies we have today, or perhaps ever. In a sense, they are baseless beliefs. Yet, most of everyone’s beliefs are baseless, and so I see great value in clarifying what they are so that we’re at least not blind to what runs our lives.

This will likely be a work in progress for the rest of my life. As my understanding evolves, I’ll update this doc accordingly. I may change my stance 180 degrees in the future. Nothing is static.

### Nature does not play dice

There are rules that govern every aspect of our universe including our selves.
Cause / effect.
Action reaction.

Things only seem random at times because we don’t have sufficient understanding of the underlying rules that govern that phenomena, and / or we don’t have the computational power to decode it.
Truth
Truths exist all around us and within is.

Two hydrogen and one oxygen makes water.
Red and blue makes violet.
Hate begets hate.

### External vs. internal truths

External truths can often be represented in formal language through words, equations, etc.

Internal truths cannot be cannot be represented by formal language because they are of a higher representational complexity than what formal language can represent. Can you describe the truth about how someone feels? Even if you could freeze a person’s feeling in time and spend your entire life analyzing it?

### Understanding

Our understanding of what is true is represented as intuition (or feeling) in our minds.

While we may use intellectual reasoning to arrive at an understanding, once we understand it, we access that understanding through intuition. A child learns that 1 + 1 = 2 at first. And then whenever they see 1 + 1, 2 arrives through intuition, not an intellectual process.

### We are deeply ignorant

We only understand a tiny, tiny percentage of the way the universe works.
We understand even less about our selves.
There is always a better understanding available.

### We are deeply deluded

Even of what we think we understand, most of it is incorrect - mis-aligned with reality.

### Seek truth

Because we are both deeply ignorant and deluded about what is true, we must seek out truth to improve our understanding.

Understanding what is true helps us get what we want, no matter what that want is: build better relationships, create wealth, cure cancer, or even create great suffering in the world.

### Desires force us to seek truth

Those who aren’t good at seeking truth find that they don’t achieve the results they are striving for because actions based on delusion make it difficult to get what you want.
We all seek truth
A child hesitantly touches the water to see if it’s too cold.
An entrepreneur seeks truth about what people crave.
A scientist seeks truth about the world.
An artist seeks truth about the human condition.

### Skill in seeking truth

Seeking truth is a recursive search problem
All of us fundamentally want the same thing: peace and happiness.
You may use different words to describe that feeling, but the feeling is the same.

Yet, the sub-wants that we create to fulfill the core desire are different. To achieve inner peace one may want become rich, another wants fame and status, another wants to find love.

Each want fuels its own truth seeking cycle. You want something, and you are compelled to seek the truths that you need to understand in order to fufill that want. Each truth seeking cycle creates more sub-wants recursively.

Example 1:
You want happiness. You seek truth about what leads to happiness by looking at the world around you. You notice that doctors, lawyers and businesspeople seem to be happy, but you can only choose one path. This spawns 3 sub-wants:
The want to understand how happy doctors are
The want to understand how happy lawyers are
The want to understand how happy business people are

Each want requires its own truth seeking sub-process. Once you’ve achieved sufficient understanding, you will act on your understanding by choosing that path.

Example 2:
You want to build a company that sends people to Mars.
This want spawns sub-wants:
The want to pick the best co-founders
The want to make rocket building cheaper.
The want to raise money to enable you to build the rocket.
(And many more sub-wants)

Each want has its own sub-process. The want to pick the best co-founders requires you to seek truth about what the qualities of the ideal cofounder are for this sort of company, who you already know that has these qualities, how to pitch this idea to them. Each of those turns into their own sub-wants: e.g. the want to understand what made XYZ founder great at building their company - so that you can use that understanding to make sense of the qualities of the ideal cofounder, and so on.

Once you build a sufficient understanding to be able to fulfill your want, you bubble back up to the higher level want and so on.

### This process is messy.

The mind can jump between different parts of the recursive tree of wants. One moment you want to find a solution to an equation, and the next you want to eat something tasty, and the next you want to go for a run. The mind can jump between different depths: while you’re writing code for the rocket’s firmware, your mind suddenly jumps to wanting to clarify the vision of your company.

### Seeking truth is observing, understanding, valuing and predicting

1. Observing: the mind is on the lookout for truths that will help you fulfill the want.
2. Understanding: the mind internalizes observations to form an understanding which will determine which action to take.
3. Valuing: the mind values each truth differently based on how important it is to help you get what you want. The value of a truth enables the mind to prioritize.
4. Predicting: Based on what you know, the mind makes educated guesses about what else could be true. These guesses (and the inherent values the mind assigns to these guesses) determines what path the mind takes. Each guess can become its own sub-want and sub-process in the recursive search tree.

### The subconcious plays a large role in truth seeking

### You need to act in order to seek truth

### We have less control over our desires than we think

### Culture and evolution determine our wants

Evolutionary programming convinces us that being at the top of the pack is what will leads to peace. Having more resources than we need leads to peace. Having great sex leads to peace.

Cultural programming determines the sub-wants we have to fulfill the wants generated by evolutionary programming. If being wealthy leads to being at the top of the pack, more resources, and mates to have sex with, we will want to become wealthy. If being the most religious leads to being at the top of the pack, more resources, and mates to have sex with, we will want to be more religious.

One of our greatest delusions is believing that our evolutionary wants will actually fulfill our core want for peace. Most of us suck at seeking truth to realize what the right sub-wants even are to fulfill our core want.
Truth seeking process is regulated through the biological reward system.
What you say you want doesn’t matter.

(todo: satiation and agitation).,

Someone who says they want to be a billionaire, but experience strong satiation after earning a million, will suck at aggressively seeking truth to become a billionaire. Or, if they become too agitated by the process and experience no satiation for long periods of time, they will give up.

Great truth seekers must be great at managing their biological reward mechanism such that the satiation and agitation does not throw them off course.

The path is as narrow as a razor’s edge.

Power law thinking:
A few decisions matter far more than others.
For each of those decisions, a single option is far better than the rest.
