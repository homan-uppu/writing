As AI gets more powerful, the outcomes of knowledge workers will follow the power law: the best will capture most of the value, leaving little for the average. Median compensations will plummet, and the higher end compensations will skyrocket.

As the median compensation plummets, paying for education no longer works because most people won't be able to recoup their investment. Students will become debt-ridden, or tax-payers will be debt-ridden (if the gov pays for students), or institutions that take a cut of future salaries without charging up front, will go broke because most students won't make enough.

The core business model of education will no longer work.

This happens because AI makes knowledge work more creative by doing the less creative work for us. And the more creative a skill becomes, the more extreme the power law distribution of outcomes, and the lower the median outcome.
## Creative skills have power law distribution of outcomes

We've already observed that the power law dominates all creative fields:

- (andrew chen's image).
- (mobile app downloads)
- (companies - Peter Thiel quote).
- (only fans outcomes chart).
- (substack outcomes)

We've yet to find any sort of "middle class" in creative fields. In fact, they all seem to be becoming more lopsided over time, as the tools become better and as more creators join in. 

The more creative the skill is, the more extreme the power law distribution of outcomes: the top capture an even greater percentage of outcomes, and the median compensation isn't sufficient to sustain most.

The power law distribution of outcomes in and of itself doesn't invalidate education's business model. Only when the median compensation becomes insufficient does paying to learn fail because it means that too many people won't be able to recoup their investments.

But, an insufficient median compensation (most can't live off of it) and the power law go hand in hand. The more extreme the power law becomes: the greater the gap between those who are great at what they do and the rest, and 


- Definitely have to talk about how we recalibrate our expectations of what every human deserves. - this is a super, super important point. Because the absolute value actually rises even beyond inflation, but so do our desires. And therefore the median will feel quite insufficient.

When the creativity required in software engineering, or design, or marketing, or analysis, or whatever new roles we create, to match that of, say, entrepreneurs or content creators, the outcomes too will match theirs: most won't be able to make a sustainable income in the same way that most content creators can't make a living through their creations.
## Why knowledge work will become highly creative.

Let's take software engineering as a case study. I'm choosing this skill because computer science is the fastest growing major, and because software engineers have been quick to adopt AI into their workflows so we can study how AI has impacted this skill.

First, let me clarify what I mean by creativity: the more creative a task is, the more ways there are to do it. To define it more precisely, creativity is proportional to the number of actions you can take, and the number of possible states you can end up in. (For those familiar with game theory, I define how creative a skill / task is as proportional to the game complexity - i.e. Go is more creative than Chess, etc.). A worker on a factory line only has so many ways in which they can assemble something. It's not that creative. A content creator has nearly endless possibilities for a video. Highly creative.

In the mid 2010's, I would say that you could reliably train software engineers to be good enough to land great jobs in the world. While the best engineers were incredibly creative, and competent, and oftentimes an order of magnitude better than the average, there was still a lot of room for the average to contribute and grow within companies.

The average had room because most engineers still had to do the low creativity work of implementing things. And anyone who has ever written software pre AI knows just how much grunt work goes into translating a great idea on paper into an actual working breathing application.

But what would happen when AI can do most of that grunt work? Then, an engineer would focus on higher level decision making: architecture, system design, and perhaps product decisions. And they'd only drop into lower levels of abstractions when AI fails.

Pushing it even further: what would happen when AI can translate a spec and design references into features reliably; when a software engineer can command and instruct intelligent, instantaneous, always available teammates to do most of the engineering? The engineer would become a sort of mini CEO within the company: obsessing over what products / business lines to build, how to serve customers best, while diving deep into the code when the AI fails. In fact, many of the best "engineers" at the fastest growing startups already operate in this way as they aggressively push current generation AI to build for them.

As AI improves, software engineering becomes very entrepreneurial. In other words, it becomes highly creative.

We can how a similar evolution would happen for any role. Designers who would spend a lot of time tweaking design files in Figma would similarly spend a lot more time on the brand, understanding customers, and how the product would evolve to serve their needs better.
## Is the power law inevitable?

This is an important question to explore because if the power law distribution of outcomes for creative skills is a temporary phenomenon, and eventually we'll build better education programs that can make most people good enough to make a living, then paying to learn will not become invalid. It'll eventually come back into popularity.

From what I can tell based on my research, the power law distribution of productivity is an inevitable feature that is proportional to how creative the skill is, and how quickly an individual can create. There is no way to eliminate the power law without changing how creative the skill is, or how long it takes an individual to create things.

Firstly, to be clear, the outcomes can always be forced to not follow the power law, even if the underlying productivity across people follows the power law. For example, a central authority can always say that anyone who makes a movie is guaranteed a certain salary, even though only a small percentage of all films made will generate profits. So technically speaking, no, the power law distribution of outcomes is not inevitable. But, such a forced equality isn't sustainable because:
1. It reduces the number of hits because individual creators are less driven to deliver hits (as their wealth doesn't depend on it).
2. And as the number of hits dwindles, less money is distributed amongst everyone. So eventually, such a system would also lead to insufficient median outcomes for everyone, instead of only most people. I.e. everyone is equally worse off.

Even if the skill is highly creative, we may not see the power law distribution of productivity for a while if it takes too long to implement ideas. In a hypothetical universe, let's say that it took us 1000x longer to build a feature of an app than it does today. In such a world, even if one entrepreneur is significantly better than another, because of how long it takes to build and ship products, to the outside world it won't look like they're much different until much further down the line. It's as if time moves more slowly: the underlying power law isn't gone, it just manifests more slowly so it doesn't seem as pronounced until much further down the line.

But, can productivity not follow the power law distribution for highly creative skills such that the gap between the best and the median becomes less large over time? In other words, even if AI makes a skill more creative and exhibit a more strong power law distribution of outcomes in the short-term, could that power law disappear, or become less pronounced, after some time?

I haven't seen an example of this existing.

If there were such a training program to make everyone similarly good enough without such a massive difference than those who are good and the average, then we've had centuries to try and figure it out for fields such as writing, filmmaking, music, entrepreneurship, etc. but we haven't. The majority of startups that go through the most successful startup accelerators will still fail, the majority of musicians, filmmakers, and authors that go to the top schools and study from the best still fail. And the small percentage who succeed big, capture most of the value.

There's another example that neatly demonstrates the relationship between the creativity of the skill, and the power law distribution of productivity: comparing the relative skill of players in Chess vs. Go. Chess and Go are two popular board games.

...

Why is this the case? Exploring this in sufficient depth is an essay (or rather book) in and of itself, but I believe the more creative the skill is, the more we find the power distribution of productivity because of the nature of how our minds learn creative skills. 

Therefore, the power law distribution of productivity is directly proportional to the degree of creativity of the skill. There's no way around this truth, unless there's some significant change in the way our minds grasp creative skills.

## Venture capital will eat education

We'll need an education system built on a fundamentally different business model that doesn't rely on everyone becoming good enough to be sustainable. In other words, well need something similar to venture capital (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital): putting money & resources in the hands of individuals to fund their learning (instead of asking money from them), in exchange for equity in their outcomes. Before I explore this, let's first establish why knowledge work will become highly creative - nearing the level of creativity in the domains we just saw.

- What will these future institutions look like? **I'm not sure** (really lean into your own ignorance, because you are! Leave the deeper exploration of what these could be for later). But, whatever they look like, they will need to operate on the venture capital business model. To be clear, this isn't because I think that is the way the world *should* work. What *I want* doesn't matter because as knowledge work becomes highly creative, no other business model works for learning those skills due to the fundamental nature of learning highly creative skills, not because some people want it to be that way. 
- We may see institutions that resemble startup accelerators that mentor for specific roles. We may see more individuals creating their own learning journey: they will raise money to fund their own experiments, build their own communities of friends and peers to learn from and collaborate with, and take a path unencumbered by the weight of the traditional education system. Whatever the outcomes will be, I'm sure there will be many worthwhile experiments. But, at their core, they will all rely on the new business model for education: venture capital.
