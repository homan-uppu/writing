As AI gets more powerful, most people won't make enough to be able to recoup their investment in their education.

This will happen because AI makes knowledge work (and eventually all work) more creative, by doing the less creative parts of it for us. The more creative our work becomes, the more outcomes follow the power law distribution: the best capture the majority of the value created, and the median compensation falls and eventually becomes insufficient.

In a world in which knowledge work becomes highly creative, the best (and only viable) business model for education is venture capital: putting money in the hands of students (instead of asking them to pay), in exchange for equity in their outcomes (i.e. a small equity in the assets they will own in the future). The few that strike big, will provide sufficient returns to compensate for the increasing many that won't become good enough.

We've already observed that the power law dominates all creative fields:

- (andrew chen's image).
- (mobile app downloads)
- (companies - Peter Thiel quote).
- (only fans outcomes chart).
- (substack outcomes)

We've yet to find any sort of "middle class" in creative fields. In fact, they all seem to be becoming more lopsided over time: the best capture more value and the median value falls, as the tools to create become better, distribution becomes cheaper, and as the number of creators increase.

To be clear, the power law itself isn't the problem, it's the falling median compensation invalidates paying for education because most will not be able to make back their investment. Yet, the power law distribution seems to be inextricably linked to an insufficient median compensation.

When I first came across this observation I was taken aback because it made it seem that the world was zero-sum: someone creating more value meant that they took it from someone else. But I also knew that these creative fields were positive sum: their overall markets have been growing rapidly. The pie is undeniably getting bigger. (note: insert relevant statistic). So everyone should be making more right? And in fact, more creators make more money overall.

Then I realized that the definition of what is considered sufficient changes rapidly in our modern world. As the rich create a market for more expensive cutting edge products and experiences, some of those innovations become so good that we all view them as necessities instead of luxuries, giving the rich unfair advantages. And while the median compensation may still afford the things that previous generations considered luxuries, it will never feel enough because we recalibrate what we consider to be sufficient -  increasingly so as we innovate more rapidly. 

In addition to this constant recalibration, there is still some element "taking from others". When a new product is created that is significantly better than what people already use, when people switch to it, the existing products do lose revenue. This also applies to content as well: when I find a new content creator covering the same topic as someone I already follow but in a way I find better, I'm more likely to switch over completely because I don't have time to watch both.

Regardless of the reasons, it's quite clear that as the skill becomes more creative, and the power law distribution of outcomes becomes more extreme, the median compensation falls.

Is it inevitable that most won't make enough in creative skills?

This is an important question to explore before we go further because if it were possible for us to create a new education program that can reliably train people to be good enough at a highly creative skill, such that the median compensation is sufficient to recoup their investment in education, then paying to learn is not a fundamentally broken business model, and I can end the essay here.

My belief is that it's impossible to **not** have a power law distribution of outcomes for highly creative skills, and thereby an insufficient median compensation - unless the equal outcomes is forced onto the system by an external agent (like a government) - **regardless of the quality of education available**.

And even if the outcomes are equalized by force (tax away all excess from the ones that make it), the underlying distribution of productivity still follows the power law, proportional to how creative the skill is. This is a fundamental property of creativity that won't change unless something fundamentally changes in the way our minds work.

Before I dive deeper to explain why I believe this, I need to more clearly define what I mean by creativity. The more creative a task is, the more ways there are to do it. Even more precisely: creativity is proportional to the number of actions you can take, and the number of possible states you can end up in. A worker on a factory line only has so many ways in which they can assemble something. It's not that creative. A content creator has nearly endless possibilities for a video. Highly creative.

When I started exploring this topic, the first thing I tried to look for was any evidence in human history of an excellent teacher or institution for a highly creative skill that trained the majority of its students to be good enough in that skill (i.e. they could live off of that skill). I couldn't find one.

Even at the most successful startup accelerators, the majority of startups fail. Even for the most legendary early stage startup investors, the majority of their investments failed. The majority who graduate the best courses for creating content, by content creators who have done exceptionally well, can't live off of creating content. Historically, even at the greatest acting, writing, filmmaking schools, the majority of graduates could not establish themselves as actors, writers, or filmmakers. There are many children of world class creators who choose to go down the same path as their parent, who have access to the best mentorship and resources, and yet never become good enough.

Now, you might stop me there and claim that those who didn't make it as, say, filmmakers still found work in the film industry as assistant filmmakers, or some other role. But those roles are lower creativity, and hence they changed the skill itself to one that had a less pronounced power law distribution of productivity in order to sustain themselves. Or perhaps someone who studied writing to become an author, failed and ended up becoming a public school teacher. They left a higher creativity skill to a lower one. I still count these as not making enough at the more creative skill that they initially aimed for, due to the low median compensation of those skills.

There's something about highly creative skills that makes them impossible to train reliably at scale, even when you have the best teacher, mentors, and resources. I think it's because the more creative the skill, the more it relies on intuition that manifests through taste (https://paulgraham.com/goodtaste.html) and judgement (https://nav.al/judgment). The less creative it a skill is, the more it relies on following rules and guidelines. With sufficient time, the latter can be trained for reliably. Training intuition can't be done directly. You can't read all the books there are on entrepreneurship and be able to build a great company. Training intuition happens indirectly: by doing, through inspiration, through personalized feedback at the right time from the right people. And even when all of those boxes are ticked, some peoples' intuitions may take very long to get good enough, and many never get good enough, for reasons that are difficult to explain, and would take an entire essay to explore in reasonable depth.

There's also another interesting, albeit more technical, piece of evidence that shows that the power law is directly proportional to how creative the skill is, independent of the quality of training.

Let's compare two popular board games: Chess & Go. Go is more creative than Chess according to our definition of creativity because there are many more actions you can take in Go from any given position, and you can end up in many more possible states. If we compare the relative skill of the players in these two board games, we'll find that the power law is more pronounced in Go than in Chess.  In other words, the best player in Go is much better than the average Go player than the best Chess player is compared to the average Chess player. And it's a smooth curve. I.e. the gap between 1 & 2 is greater in Go than in Chess, and so is the gap between 2 & 3, and so on.

What's also important to notice that the median relative skill in Go is lower than in Chess. Correlating to the real world in which people are compensated according to their productivity, it would mean that the mean compensation falls as the skill becomes more creative.

(todo: a neat diagram that shows the ELO ratings between the 2).

I really like this example because the games have largely remained unchained for decades, and most of the top players have the best possible training and resources, so you can't say that the power law only exists because the best had better training.  Even with significantly better training by playing computers, and excellent coaching centers for the best players, we still find the power law distribution of outcomes. Even if we achieve AGI and give each player access to the greatest coach imaginable, we would still find a power law distribution proportional to the degree of creativity of the game.

The power law distribution of productivity is inevitable.

(todo: there's prob more to be said about the connection between productivity and outcomes).

So far we've only studied the behavior of highly creative skills. We've always had highly creative skills in the world, but only a small percentage of the world participated in them. Most did low creativity work, which is what enabled the middle class to rise: because the power law isn't as pronounced for less creative work.

But soon all knowledge work, and eventually all work, will become highly creative, and the power law distribution of productivity (and outcomes) will be become quite extreme. This will happen because each time our technology becomes more powerful, it increases the complexity of our work, and therefore the work requires a greater degree of creativity, which amplifies the power law distribution of productivity for the skill.

To explain why, let's take the example of software engineering. I think it's a good case because it's the fastest growing college major, and because those who work with technology are usually the first to adopt new technologies into their workflows and lives. Seeing how AI has changed software engineering will give us a glimpse of the future for all knowledge work.

Before AI, the majority of actual software engineering work was only moderately creative. Anyone who's built software applications before large language models knows just how much grunt work there is to turn an idea into reality. The majority of code written was "glue code" (todo: get a good reference here): code used to connect together different software services to make it do what you want. A simple idea for an app would take weeks of grinding through predominantly not that creative grunt work in order to actually bring it to life.

Now, with the latest AI models (OpenAI's o1 / Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 3.5), AI can write the majority of the less creativity code that took most of our time in the pre-AI era. Now, more of an engineer's time is spent on more creative work: on the system architecture, deciding which external services to use and why, and on product decisions like figuring out what to build and why, and they only need to drop down into lower creativity work in the cases that AI fails. And working on higher level architecture and product decisions is far more creative than writing glue code because there are many, many more possibilities in how you can do it.
> (note: this is in most cases, and this doesn't yet apply to those working on deep tech problems for which current models aren't good enough to help with that much yet), 

What will happen when each engineer has access to models that are 10x more capable than the current ones? What happens when each engineer has access to a near infinite number of reasonably capable, always-on, fast, teammates they can instruct as if they were instructing junior teammates? What happens when you can give an AI a detailed spec of the software you want built, and some design inspirations to help guide its style and look and feel, and it does a great job at implementing it? An engineer's work becomes even more creative: they'll focus more on product and business decisions: figuring out what to build and why, and only jumping down into technical details only when the AI fails.

In other words as AI becomes more capable, **engineers will require the same skillset as startup founders**. And we know just how creative that is, and just how extreme the power law distribution of productivity is for that: most aren't good enough.

There are early signs that this shift is well underway. As engineering is becoming more creative, coding bootcamps are going broke (https://x.com/gergelyorosz/status/1732876403626926300?s=46), more startups are hiring engineers the way you hire a creative: based on their portfolio, conversations and referrals alone without any kind of standardized exam (which is impossible for any creative skill). And junior engineers / new grads no longer have job opportunities because the baseline talent required is much higher than ever before. The less creative, work no longer exists.

It's easy to see how a similar evolution will happen for all knowledge work. Designers who spend time tweaking layout properties in their design software will instead spend far more time on defining the brand, product, understanding users and crafting a compelling vision. Marketers instead of spending most of their time operating software, and doing the grunt work to implement marketing campaigns, will instead spend most of their time understanding and optimizing for the incredibly complex and changing human desire.

The power law distribution of productivity will become un-imaginably steep. The right engineers, marketers, designers, or any role that we will invent, will be many, many orders more productive than the average ones. And those who aren't one of the best, will struggle to make enough.

How do we adapt to this new reality in which we find a massive power law distribution of outcomes across the economy? How will our education system evolve if most people who take out loans and pay for education won't be able to repay it?

It's now 2028, and it's abundantly clear that paying for education doesn't work anymore. Millions of graduates are in debt that they don't know how to repay their loans. And millions of prospective colleges students are spooked and are trying to find alternate ways to train themselves to become skilled enough in an increasingly complex and creative world.

The first, rational step, is to forgive all student loans. I can't imagine any other option because having millions of young people burdened with debt they can't repay in any reasonable amount of time poisons a country's growth and prosperity. Not just because they won't create / buy things, but also because it will lead to a sort of pessimism to pervade the culture for generations. Our minds are what limit us the most, and a country full of young pessimistic people isn't good for economic growth because less of us will want to create and innovate. (note: something to be said about how the great depression impacted future generations, as well as the dire economic conditions of India, etc. - Asian parents like mine want the safe path for their children likely due to the incredibly harsh economic conditions in Asia a few decades ago.).

The next natural reaction is to make education free for everyone and tax the ones who do become good enough more heavily to make up for the cost of education. This feels like right thing to do, and it may even be a beneficial starting point, but there are fundamental flaws with this approach. 

A more creative skill is not only more difficult to train for, it's also far more difficult to teach. The right teachers / mentors have to be good enough, and when they are good enough, their compensation on the market will be astronomically high (due to the power law distribution of outcomes). When the engineers who are good enough can make tens to hundreds of millions of dollars on the market, hiring them to teach won't be feasible for the average college. The best teachers will flock to the private institutions that can pay them what they're worth and give them the resources they need, or they'll just be building the future. Instead of democratizing opportunity, making education free further concentrates distribution of opportunity towards those who are rich enough to attend the private schools with the best teachers.

I think there's a much better way. In fact, given the economic incentives that dictate how our world evolves, I see no other way in the long-term. No other way.

- Greed scales.

- There's an incredibly important point about how letting every citizen **directly own** the best companies by default changes their fundamental relationship with growth. They are invested. They are more likely to cheer FOR innovation vs. being vehemently against. And how people feel about growth is just as important for growth as actually building things is.

1. Too expensive. (i.e. the free schools won't be able to attract the best talent, and it will be more important than ever before to attract the best talent).
2. No forcing function to improve the quality of education.
3. Benefits rich students far more than the average. Concentrates distribution of opportunity.
