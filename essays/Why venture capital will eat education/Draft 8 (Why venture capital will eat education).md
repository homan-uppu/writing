It's popular to claim that our education system is "broken". I've been hearing this for at least a decade now, yet not much has changed. Most young people still aspire to go to college, get a degree, and get a great job.

But, something IS different this time around. Artificial intelligence is causing the world to change rapidly in a way that invalidates our current education system, and more broadly, invalidates the business model of paying for education itself.

Our education system is on the verge of complete collapse.

Why? How? And importantly, what's going to replace it?

People claim that AI will create more jobs than it will take. After all, this has been the trend for as long as humans have invented better tools: every major technological breakthrough first invalidates certain professions, and in the long-run creates far more jobs than it took. E.g. The printing press invalidated the need for most scribes, yet in the long-run created many jobs by creating a much larger market for books. Many people were eventually employed in the manufacturing, transportation, and distribution of books at a scale that was previously impossible. Enabled by a technological leap.

But, there's a critical fact that's usually lost in claims like the one above: many of the new jobs are often more complex and more difficult to get good at than the ones that were invalidated. 

"Complexity" is proportional to how many ways there are of doing something, or even more technically: how many possible states you can end up in. Assembling a chair on a factory line isn't that complex: there are only so many ways (often 1) of doing it. Creating a Youtube video is highly complex because there are nearly infinite possibilities.

The more complex a skill is, the more creative it becomes. The more creative a skill is, the less you're able to get good enough by following a prescribed set of rules or guidelines for how to do it. For example, you can reliably train a large number of people to get good enough to work on a factory assembly line, but you can't hope the same when trying to train entrepreneurs, content creators, or artists. Even at the best training programs for these highly creative skills, only a tiny percentage ever get good enough to make a living from it.

What does our work becoming more creative have to do with the education system? If all of our work becomes more creative, and there's an abundance of work for all of us to do because there will be more jobs created than taken, isn't that great?!

The challenge with our world becoming far more creative is that the more creative a skill becomes, the more the distribution of productivities of individuals performing that skill follows the power law: a small percentage will outperform the rest by orders of magnitudes. The more creative, the more stark the inequality. And, in a world in which individuals are compensated proportional to their economic productivity (i.e. most of the world today), outcomes (wealth) too will follow the power law distribution.

The power law dominates all creative fields:

- (mobile app downloads)
- (companies - Peter Thiel quote).
- (only fans outcomes chart).
- (substack outcomes)

There is no "middle class" for creative skills. If you make it, you make it big, else you struggle to get by.

The "struggling to get by" is incredibly important for us to study because the power law itself doesn't invalidate our education system, it's the lower median productivity that makes it difficult for most who train for a creative skill to become good enough to make a living from it. If most can't get good enough to make a living at any kind of work in the world, then paying for any kind of education will become a luxury that only the rich can afford, because most won't be able to recoup their investment in education.

The power law distribution seems to be inextricably linked to an insufficient median compensation. The more stark the power law (i.e. more unequal the distribution of productivity becomes), the lower the median productivity falls. And in a world in which people generate wealth according to their economic productivity, the median compensation also falls.

When I first came across this observation I was taken aback because it made it seem that the world was zero-sum: someone creating more value meant that they took it from someone else. But I also knew that these creative fields were positive sum: their overall markets have been growing rapidly. The pie is undeniably getting bigger. (note: insert relevant statistic). So everyone should be making more right? And in fact, more creators make more money overall.

Then I realized that the definition of what we consider "sufficient" changes rapidly in our modern world. As the rich create a market for more expensive cutting edge products and experiences, some of those innovations become so good that we all view them as necessities instead of luxuries, giving the rich unfair advantages. And while the median compensation may still afford the things that previous generations considered luxuries, it will never feel enough because we recalibrate what we consider to be sufficient -  increasingly so as we innovate more rapidly. 

In addition to this constant recalibration, there is still some element "taking from others". When a new product is created that is significantly better than what people already use, when people switch to it, the existing products do lose revenue. This also applies to content as well: when I find a new content creator covering the same topic as someone I already follow but in a way I find better, I'm more likely to switch over completely because I don't have time to watch both.

Is it inevitable that most will never make enough in highly creative domains? Or is an insufficient median productivity a temporary phenomena, and if we created better training programs, it could be the case that eventually most people can make a living from their work?

This is an important question because if it's a temporary phenomenon, then the collapse of paying for education too will be temporary. And once the median compensation is high enough, we'll all be back to paying college tuitions and taking on debt to fund our educations. And frankly, I can just conclude the essay here.

From what I can tell,
