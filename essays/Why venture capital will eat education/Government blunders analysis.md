*the following analysis should be summarized quickly in the conclusion. there's no need for a separate section on this. just get straight to what you think is the best education system given the realities you presented above.*

As we quickly enter this new world, we're going to blunder in huge ways before arriving at the solution that works. This is because most of our natural, emotional, reactions to this situation will lead to the very thing that we're trying to prevent: unfair access to opportunity. Most of us, (and contrary to popular belief, this also includes many of the richest people), hate unfair access to opportunity. Our blood boils, rightly so, when we see someone who lacks opportunity to thrive in this world... especially if they have potential.

There are four reactions that I want to focus on, and explore whether they actually help us achieve the outcomes we want.
1. Pardoning student loan debt.
2. Making education free for all.
3. Heavily tax the winners and redistribute.
4. Ban AI so that our work doesn't become more creative, preventing the massive power law distribution of productivity that leads to inequality in outcomes.

The first natural reaction from a government would be to pardon all student loan debt because many of today's graduates themselves won't be able to pay it back on any reasonable timeline. And having most of your young ambitious citizens burdened with crippling debt is terrible for a country's long-term prosperity *(generational trauma - cite Great depression).*, so I think this move makes a lot of sense. Great.

The next natural reaction is to make education free for everyone to try and level the education playing field. This is a massive blunder regardless of how this is done.

If this is done by the government paying the colleges instead of the students paying the colleges, this will do nothing more than prop up useless colleges that don't offer a good enough education. It removes the forcing function for the college to improve...

We need 2 things:
1. Greater experimentation.
2. Wider distribution of opportunity.

Another massive natural reaction is to heavily tax the winners and redistribute to the rest of the population. 

And finally, there's
