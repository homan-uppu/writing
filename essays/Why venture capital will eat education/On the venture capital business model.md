Venture capital is a popular way that startups today are funded. This model goes back many centuries, but to understand it properly, we must first grasp one of humanity's most transformative innovations: the concept of the company itself.

The modern company emerged from a remarkable evolution in human organizational thinking. While money allowed humans to trade value, the company structure allowed them to pool resources, share risk, and undertake ventures far beyond any individual's capabilities. This innovation began taking shape in ancient Mesopotamia, where partnerships for trading expeditions were documented in cuneiform tablets, but it was in medieval Europe where the modern company truly began to emerge.

The turning point came in the 16th and 17th centuries with the creation of joint-stock companies. The Dutch East India Company (VOC), founded in 1602, marked a revolutionary moment - it was the first company to issue shares to the public and establish a permanent capital base. This innovation meant that ownership could be divided into transferable shares, allowing investors to participate in profitable ventures without taking on unlimited liability or needing to be involved in day-to-day operations.

The company structure solved several crucial problems:
- Limited Liability: Investors could risk only their investment amount, not their entire personal wealth
- Perpetual Existence: Unlike partnerships that dissolved when partners died or left, companies could exist indefinitely
- Transferable Ownership: Shares could be bought and sold without disrupting the business
- Pooled Capital: Large sums could be raised from many investors for ambitious projects
- Professional Management: Specialized managers could run operations while owners provided capital

This organizational innovation catalyzed the Industrial Revolution, enabling the massive capital accumulation needed for factories, railroads, and other infrastructure. It democratized investment by allowing ordinary people to own pieces of major enterprises. The company structure essentially created a new form of property - one that could grow, adapt, and outlive its founders while maintaining legal and operational continuity.

These features made the company an unprecedented engine for innovation and economic growth. The ability to aggregate capital while limiting individual risk meant that ambitious, speculative ventures could be undertaken - from exploring new trade routes to developing groundbreaking technologies. This laid the groundwork for modern venture capital, where investors can back multiple high-risk, high-reward opportunities while maintaining a balanced portfolio.
