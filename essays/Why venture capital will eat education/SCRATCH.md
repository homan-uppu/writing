Investing capital into companies in exchange for equity in them is the only viable business model in domains in which only a few win, and those that do, win big. This is how many of the most successful technology companies have been built.

“Especially in software, many situations have winner-take-all dynamics due to network effects and switching costs. Being the winner means being in the 99.99-percentile. A winner at the top takes nearly everything, and only a pittance goes to the others — so being 99.99-percentile is worth an order of magnitude or two more than being just 98-percentile” ([Peter Thiel](https://www.8vc.com/resources/lessons-from-peter-thiel))

As all of our work becomes highly creative and follows the power law distribution of outcomes, education will need to be funded in a similar way: individuals with potential are invested in, in exchange for some equity in their outcomes: I.e the assets they will accumulate in the future by leveraging their knowledge. 

The fewer who succeed, will succeed more greatly than ever before. The returns from those investments will more than compensate for the many who will also be invested in, but won’t end up creating much, if any, economic value.

I’ve started to see many sharp young people realize that paying for an education is no longer a sound financial decison. They instead choose to train themselves to directly create value in the world by making products, creating content, building businesses, consulting, apprenticing, etc. Yet for most taking this path is tough without external help to sustain themselves. And having to take up a menial job to sustain yourself is a significant disadvantage because you’re missing out on valuable time to learn. The more creative the skill, the better you have to be to be good enough, and so the more valuable each moment of training is.
