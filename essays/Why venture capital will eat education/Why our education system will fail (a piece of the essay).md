The traditional education system fails because it isn't the right business model for teaching highly creative skills. And because most education doesn't train well for highly creative skills. As ROI for paying for education plummets as our work becomes more creative, less people will pay for education.

I'm already seeing sharp young high schoolers figure out this reality who are working incredibly hard to directly create value in the world through online businesses and startups. I'd bet we'll see a many younger startup / business founders in the coming years.

But, we still have a big problem. Building businesses / startups is one path out of many interesting, valuable paths that an individual can take. What about those that show signs of great potential, but aren't yet ready to start a company, or don't want to. Maybe they're interested in deep tech research ([https://x.com/hud_zah/status/1827057785995141558](https://x.com/hud_zah/status/1827057785995141558)) that will take them a much longer time to get good at compared to learning how to build apps. Or maybe they want to deeply study economics to contribute towards our economic policies. Or maybe they're a budding podcaster who wants to explore their natural curiosities by talking to interesting people ([https://meridian.mercury.com/dwarkesh-patel](https://meridian.mercury.com/dwarkesh-patel)).

Some valuable paths take longer to come to fruition and are less investable in the traditional startup investing sense. Yet, these individuals too will create generational companies, achieve scientific breakthroughs and artistic achievements, though they're not in a position to start a company today and raise money for it.  

Not having access to capital to enable individuals to sustain themselves puts them at a huge disadvantage because they’re missing out on valuable time to learn. The more creative the world becomes, the better you have to be to be good enough, and thus each moment of training is more valuable and important than ever before. [ofc_menial_still_valuable].

As of today, such individuals have two options: rely on family wealth or rely on grants (such as the Thiel Fellowship and Emergent ventures). If they don't have access to capital to fund their learning, they're at a severe disadvantage because it means they can only follow their natural curiosities outside of the time they have to spend dealing with the traditional education system or working a job to survive. As the power law distribution of outcomes becomes more pronounced, those without the safety net to explore and train will be severely disadvantaged.

I see this as a massive problem for two reasons:

1. There will be many young people with great potential who won't have the bandwidth for training and exploration. 
2. Those born into wealth have a much stronger advantage because as the rest of the world is stuck either taking on debt that they will not be able to repay, wasting time in an outdated education system that will not help them in a highly creative world, or working jobs that don’t teach them much in order to survive.

We need a new technology. A new financial instrument that allows individuals to raise money on their future potential, even if they're not in a position to start a company today.
