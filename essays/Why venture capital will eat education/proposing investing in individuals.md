- growing trend: crafting your own learning journey. more young people are forced to be more experimental because the safe path doesn't feel safe anymore (and they're right!).
- younger startup founders.
- it's still expensive to carve your own path.

*the most important piece of the entire essay. this is where i think there's something novel that i want to flesh out and share with the world.*

I've started to notice some high schoolers sense that college is a waste of money and are pursuing their own learning journeys. They train themselves to be able to build software, or create content, and directly work towards creating value in the world through businesses they start. Some of them also go on to raise money for their companies.

In a domain with a power law distribution of outcomes, venture capital is the best business model. An investor gives startup founders capital in exchange for some ownership in their business. Even if most of the investments fail, as long as a few are massively successful, the investor makes money. From a founder's perspective, raising money in exchange for some equity in the company makes sense: if the company is successful the founder is still captures a lot of the value they created, and having some capital up front often increases their odds of success by letting them focus on their companies full time (vs. finding other ways to sustain themselves as they build their company).

For those that want to be startup founders, I think this path makes sense because as AI gets better all knowledge work will require the skills that they are already training for by starting their own company. As our work becomes more creative, and the power becomes more intense, I can see many more young folks directly pursue the path of entrepreneurship and raise money to fund their businesses.

That being said, building a company, or building a company *now*, may not what most choose to do. Human desire has incredible range: some 


- crafting their own learning journeys. i would **start with this** and then discuss how the accelerator model is the best model for learning bec. the incentives are very aligned. this is the right way to open this story because this is a behavior that's already on the rise.
	- there is a growing trend stemming from disillusionment with college with more young folks pursuing their own learning paths and looking to join companies / start their own much earlier than previous generations. personally, i think this is great to see bec. if you can learn how to directly create value in the world, that's a more robust skill that many other knowledge work skill eventually evolve towards anyway (as we saw above).
	- but, there are 3 main challenges with this:
		- can raise money when you have an idea you want to execute on.
		- it still takes time to train yourself to be good enough to build a great product / company. how does one fund themselves to do this?
		- starting a company is one of the many valuable things to do for the world. what options does one have if they want to be a scientist, researcher, content creator, etc.? there isn't a straightforward way to "raise money" for those fields yet, and it may even take longer to build the right skills to be able to do so. it still takes exploration that requires time and money.
- today many explorations are funded through grants (thiel fellowship, emergent ventures, etc.).

There's a way to enable far more experimentation in education, as well as distribute access to opportunity more equally: by enabling people to invest in individuals in exchange for equity in their outcomes (the assets they will accumulate in the future).

This is the similar model we have when investing in companies: people can hold equity in a company. Their ownership is valued according to how much the company is valued. While there are no fixed rules for how a company is valued, it correlates with how much value people believe it will create in the future.
