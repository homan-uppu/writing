When most graduates won't be able to earn back their investment in college in a reasonable duration, individuals will be burdened by debt.

The initial reaction is to pardon student loan debt up till this point. This makes sense because a nation who's youth is significantly burdened by debt is terrible for growth and prosperity for all. The next reaction would be to make education free. While this feels like the right thing to do, in reality it gives a significant advantage to those coming from wealth.

Democratizing access to opportunity is a worthwhile goal not just because it feels like the right thing to do, but because it's essential for economic growth and prosperity in the long-run. In a world with extreme power law distribution of outcomes, the individuals that become great at what they do create enormous value for the economy. The cost for a society when it fails to enable someone with a natural talent for something is far, far greater than ever before in human history. In order to stay competitive globally, a country has no option but to try and optimize for discovering and enabling talent.

*note: It's not enough for something to feel like the right thing to do in order for the world to optimize for it. The economic incentives must also be aligned for that change to take place. This is why climate controls such as reducing emissions, etc. never seem to take off or be enough - the economic incentives just aren't there. But, democratizing access to opportunity is economically incredibly beneficial, hence countries will have no choice but to optimize for it, especially as AI becomes more powerful.*

While access to wealth is far from being distributed equally, access to talent seems to be *(and even if it's not, the only way we'll find out is by giving everyone the opportunity to shine and study the outcomes)*. There are countless of individuals around the world who, if given access to the same resources and safety nets as a kid from a Palo Alto suburb, would create incredible value for the world. The solutions for death, global warming, and our greatest problems may be delayed by decades or centuries if we can't enable the brilliant minds rotting away doing unnecessary work, burdened by unnecessary stress, without access to opportunity. (*TODO: there's a far more powerful way to present this case.*).

In a highly complex, creative world, when a country makes education free for their citizens, wealthy individuals benefit far more than the average person. As our work becomes more complex and creative, training to become good enough becomes a lot more difficult as we've seen. And as training becomes more difficult, teaching does as well. A good teacher / mentor will be one that is also good enough at that skill. Someone with such talent would be worth an insanely high amount on the job market.

Even if all the state colleges became free, they wouldn't be able to afford the talent that would be good enough to teach it well - especially so as our skills become more creative. The best talent would go to the private colleges that can afford to pay them their market rate. The free colleges would be left with the average teachers. 

Why is this such a big deal? It's also true today, and yet those with the average teachers seem to be doing just fine! The point is that average teachers often lead to average outcomes. In a world in which the median compensation suffices, average outcomes are fine. The average Stanford grad has a significantly better education than one that goes to an unrecognized college, but as long as both land jobs, we don't really care that much about the difference in the quality of their education. But, as the power law becomes more extreme and the best capture most of the returns, any advantages in training will become far more valuable.  In theory, when a country makes education free, they can also try to pay teachers the market rate. But, in practice, it's difficult to keep pace. The best teachers will always do better for themselves going to the select few places that can compensate them adequately.

Another important reason why this approach fails is that it doesn't allow for more experimentation in education. Advocates for free education seem to believe that giving the best education that we have today to everyone is the goal. But, what if the best education we have today is terrible for training highly creative skills? What if the computer science curriculum at even the top colleges in the US are terrible to train incredible engineering talent that can build products that scale? We don't know! I'd bet that we're far, far away from anything close to the optimal training for highly creative skills.

Government support for legacy institutions like colleges doesn't enable experimentation. It takes a long time to determine whether a college is failing, especially since it will take longer to assess how well its graduates fare in the world. (*yeah, really have to expand this experimentation angle fosho.*)

Basically 2 reasons:
1. Concentrates access to opportunity.
2. Doesn't enable sufficient experimentation.

I need a better way to present these.
