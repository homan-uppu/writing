### Intro

(an overview of what this entire thing is about, to set the context so that readers have a glimpse of what’s to come, and can even skip to it directly if they wish to).

### Natural expression

Each individual is Nature's unique experiment in its effort to maximize life in the universe. Each individual is created unique. with a unique temperament, unique inclinations, unique conditioning, and a unique, natural, expression, rooted in a unique, biological code.

Equality is a delusion. No two individuals are born same. There is no equality anywhere in nature.

“Natural expression” of an individual is how they are designed to be, to act. When an individual follows their natural expression, they are more alive, energetic, joyful, and effortlessly obsessive. They live more meaningful, purposeful lives.

Natural expression has two components: direction and magnitude. Direction is what they do. Magnitude is how intensely they are naturally wired to go about it.

The way natural expression manifests is a function of the individual and environment. Mark Zuck's natural expression if he were to be born 20 years from now could look very different than starting a social networking company. Christopher Nolan, born a century from now, may have a very different manifestation of his natural expression than making 2 - 3.5 hour stories. The features and constraints of the environment elicit a particular manifestation for a given natural expression.

All natural expressions fall outside of the clearly defined paths that society has defined. 

An individual's natural expression is never useless. Throughout history, the greatest contributions often stem from activities that most considered useless / a waste of time. Each natural expression has a purpose. Nature knows more than we do. We ought to trust Nature's programming (through its genetic mutations, etc. that make each individual unique) than to apply our own limited reasoning as to what's useful and not.

The best society is one that gets out of Nature’s way by allowing its experiments to run their course: by enabling each individual to discover and double down on their natural expressions.

### Oppression

Oppression is any force that pushes an individual away from their natural expression: both in direction and magnitude.

Oppression is an act against Nature. Oppression holds humanity back from being able to tackle our greatest challenges.

Oppression can be external: authorities controlling what an individual can and cannot do, environment (lack of resources to carry out your natural expression), collectivist cultures that don’t give the individual the space to find their natural expression, dogmatic religions, etc.

Oppression can be internal: our own fears of failure, over-competitiveness, coping mechanisms (such as deluding ourselves into thinking we’ve found our natural expression when we actually haven’t), addictions, etc.

Most of the world is significantly oppressed: spending most of their time doing things they aren’t naturally inclined to want to do, desperately seeking joy, and accepting that this is all there is to life.

### Eliminating oppression

Our mission is to eliminate oppression to maximize natural expression in the world.

eliminating external oppression:

- **economic growth**. growth is worshipping Nature.

- **free markets are temples: places of worship.**

- the more capital in the free market, the less oppression.

- to increase the capital in the free market, we need economic growth.

  
AGI that will make great discoveries independent of humans will not arrive anytime soon. for the foreseeable future, great work will be human driven, with AI amplifying and executing powerful human visions.

  

- but, even with no authorities dictating what an individual does, the individual is not free. finding natural expression means overcome the craving to be accepted and liked by others. 

- the war shifts from external to internal. but, the war persists.

  

- economic incentives and culture go hand in hand.

- it's only after we had ways to organize large groups of people and the ability to traverse to far places that religions were invented to push people to conquer other places. in other words: the economic gains from conquest crafted a religion & culture that pushed for conquest.

### the organization

- designing the right organization is critically important to our success.
    
- incentives:
    

- the 4 year vesting with a 1 year cliff standard is laughably unambitious. it leads to checked out leadership and / or employees after a couple of decades (tops). organizations that stand the test of time must have a more ambitious incentive / compensation structure. we will need to figure out what this is.
    

- there will be no distinctions between types of creation except for: ambitious and non-ambitious.
    
- San Francisco will be the seat of global ambition - across any and all endeavors.
    
- the best teams work in person.
    
- the world will not be able to label this team, this organization, this effort. are we a company, an investment fund, a film production studio, a political party? a new kind of organization that will be difficult to label and categorize. a fintech? web3? social network? AI?
    

  

### conclusion

1. DM me if you're interested in working together. you must be insanely talented, completely committed, sufficiently aligned (not necessarily on the details, but you must similarly believe that this is the most important mission to work on). we will do whatever it takes to eliminate oppression of the human spirit. there is no notion of "balance". you're either all in, or you're out. there is no room for any lack of commitment or mediocrity. this is a co-founder level position. we aren't yet building out an entire team... there is room for at most 3 people (including myself) to get this off the ground.
