1. Better explain the asymmetry in the curve of players of Chess / Go.
2. Show how leverage is increasing exponentially (by referencing GDP).
3. Need to reference the exponential rise in leverage and how that makes it even tougher to update our intuitions to reflect reality - because reality is slipping away from our intuition faster than ever.
4. There's an important point about how you are bound to internalize this incorrectly: i.e. when sniffing out inequality you will be satisfied with a little whereas the right intuition is to seek out a lot of it. -> this is a critical point.
5. Organize: arrange the footnotes correctly - you have a lot, for now just get them in the right order with the right reference above. Amen.
6. Website design - keep it minimal, handle footnotes, annotations well, point to this repo.

- Need a comment on the exponential change - and how we don't have an intuition for that. To see why: even the scientists that saw the graph that predicted the growth of COVID were surprised. Everyone was. Every government had the graph beforehand, yet few were surprised. I was very surprised by the rise in cases and deaths even though I had read an essay predicting it beforehand and believed it.
