AI enables us to tackle our greatest collective challenges: from healthcare to climate change to energy.

But, on top of our current economic system, the ones poised to benefit the most from AI are those who have sufficient wealth to finance their tinkering and learning.

Without a fundamental change in our loan and credit based economic system, AI will amplify the opportunity gap between the wealthy and the rest.

This doesn't have to be the case.

It's possible to democratize opportunity by re-imagining our economic system from the ground up...

through a new kind of financial instrument.

But, before we get to that, we need to understand how AI will change the world.

AI makes our work more creative by doing the less creative work for us.

The more creative a task is, the more ways there are to do it.

For example: assembling devices on a factory line is far less creative than making music because there are far more ways to design music than there are ways to assemble things according to a fixed set of instructions.

1. As AI writes code for us, we will spend more time figuring out what to create - a fundamentally more creative task.
2. As AI analyzes and organizes data for us, we will spend more time figuring out what questions are worth asking.

By doing our less creative work, AI forces us to be more creative than ever before.

A more creative world is a good thing.

We're meant to be creative beings.

Our descendants will look at all the time we spend on manual labor, filling up spreadsheets, and even coding, as an utter waste of human potential - just like how we consider the countless hours of manual labor throughout history, as an unfortunate necessity.

In a sense, AI enables us to be more… human.

But, the more creative our work becomes, the more difficult it will be for most to be able to create economic value in the world.

The majority of the economic value will be created by a few.

This kind of winner-takes-all dynamic is an inseparable feature of creative work.

The more creative a task is, the more its outcomes follow the “power law distribution”:

The power law distribution has a notion of “degree”: how skewed outcomes are towards the top.

The more extreme the power law distribution, fewer individuals create most of the value.

The degree of the power law distribution is directly proportional to how creative the task is.

And because the creativity of our work is directly proportional to how powerful AI is, the degree of the power law distribution depends on how capable AI is.

The power law distribution exists everywhere in nature:

A few pathogens create the majority of diseases.
A few soil types support the majority of agriculture.
A few startups create most of the value.

From creator earnings on social platforms to fundamental physics, chemistry, biology, and evolution, **the power law dominates**.

what does the power law have to do with democratizing opportunity?

The challenge with the power law is that there is no “middle class”:

The more powerful AI becomes, the more creative our work becomes, the more extreme the power law distribution, and the less there is for everyone who isn’t at the top.

this leads to the modern paradox:

AI simultaneously makes creating value more accessible and also more difficult.

More accessible because it

Yet, our society relies on a normal distribution of outcomes.

Loans and credit - whether for education, housing, or anything, depends on the majority of people being able to pay it back.

As work becomes more creative, the underlying dependency of our economic system is destroyed: most will not be able to pay loans back, leading to a collapse of our economic system as we know it: people will not be able to get loans or lines of credit for anything.

Like always, those worst affected will be those who don't have much wealth.

As you read, millions of families are taking out loans to educate their young. to enable them to build their lives.

as the world becomes more creative, most will be crushed by the power law.

unable to earn back their investments.

their loans becomes the nooses.

While AI promises us a future of unforeseen prosperity and the ability to overcome humanity’s greatest challenges, on top of our existing economic system, I fear that AI will only amplify the opportunity gap between the rich and poor.

Those who can afford to experiment with AI without the burden of debt or worrying about how to feed themselves next week, will be poised to benefit from AI, while the rest waste precious time dealing with with the collapse of our economic system.

**We need to democratize opportunity.**

What can be done?

1. Forgive all loans? A reasonable start, but doing so means most people won't be able to get loans as well, so how would they pay for their education?
2. What if we made education free? The problem is, if the government (or any authority for that matter) chooses which programs / institutions are free, it's guaranteed that the free education will be mediocre. The more creative a skill is, the greater the gap between the mediocre and the best education - once again penalizing the average person.
3. What about universal basic income? Just giving money to each person every, say, month? We'll definitely need some sort of UBI, because even if everyone had the best possible education, the power law means that most will still fail to earn enough.

But, even if these are viable solutions, implementing them requires a large number of people to vote against their self-interests, which they won't.

Our democratic system gives lopsided power to older generations who generated their wealth when it was easier to do so predictably: in a less creative world.

The old, who hold political power, have more to lose than gain by forgiving all loans, and siphoning some of their wealth to younger generations.

But, EVEN if a sufficient number of people were willing to vote against their self-interests, our democratic system moves far too slowly to keep up with AI.

When AI models double in capability every year or so (and eventually at an even faster rate) a four or five year election cycle simply can't keep up. Any changes it brings will arrive too slow, irrevocably setting back those who don't come from wealth.

_(TODO: there something to be said about how each moment is precious, especially as world becomes more creative - this is an important point to communicate i think because it changes the degree of urgency of the matter)._

There is only one path to democratizing opportunity such that everyone has a shot at benefitting from AI, without relying on people voting against their self-interests, or waiting for turbulent election cycles to deliver what's required.

One path.

We need a **new financial instrument**: a “personal token”:

A personal token represents an individual's equity in companies and other personal tokens.

Therefore, a personal token is grounded in actual ownership of entities that create real value. It’s not some pure, speculative, figment of imagination.

It can be broken up into pieces and sold such that anyone who owns a piece of your personal token indirectly owns a piece of your equities in companies and other personal tokens - proportional to their share.

When a personal token owner sells their equity in companies / other personal tokens, the capital they can is distributed to each personal token shareholder (including themselves) proportional to how much equity each shareholder has in the personal token.

The individual raising capital isn't burdened by debt and can afford to be more ambitious and take greater risks - because they are sharing risk with their investors.

Investors are able to invest in talent earlier than they can today: before an individual may be ready to start a company.

Investors can truly invest in an individual instead of their ideas. Ideas can fail, but the chances for a the right individual to fail over multiple ideas is lower. Therefore, investing in individuals is a safer bet for investors than investing in ideas.

And lastly, investors will be able to invest in talent that they can't today: those who are great at what they do, but don't want to start companies, who instead want to work at great companies.

A win-win scenario for ambitious individuals and their investors.

Personal tokens unlock the only viable business model for education in the age of creativity.

The power law for creative fields show that most will fail to earn enough.

Educators will need equity in the upside of their best students to compensate for the rest.

In the age of creativity, individual educators, mentors, institutions will pay students to teach them - in exchange for equity in their personal tokens.

Personal tokens are the perfect vehicle to deliver Universal Basic Income (UBI).

Each citizen would hold a small amount of equity in the personal tokens of every other citizen.

This would mean that whenever anyone cashes out some equity in companies or other personal tokens, some of it goes to everyone.

This is fundamentally different from the government taxing and using those taxes because each citizen has direct ownership of the outcomes of others.

When someone wins, we feel their victory in our wallets. immediately.

In the age of creativity, each citizen having direct ownership of everyone else's outcomes will be required for a cohesive society because outcomes will inherently be extremely unequal.

UBI through personal tokens would give each of us a reason to celebrate each others' wins.

Like individuals, nations will also follow a power law distribution: the most prosperous nation will pull ahead from the rest of the pack, and become multiple orders of magnitude more wealthy than the next best.

We tend to underestimate just how much our way of life depends on winning.

I'm not speaking to you in English because it's a superior language when compared to, say, Telugu, but only because of the victories of the British and American empires.

Culture depends on economic might.

In the age of creativity, the winning nation will be the one that produces the best ideas, that makes things that people want and can get those things to everyone.

As AI makes each individual more powerful than ever before, the nation that can best unlock its talent to take advantage of AI will be the winner.

Personal tokens enable nations to democratize opportunity so that they can give their best shot at winning.
