1. Take an extremely small scene from [[Things to create]], and do whatever it fucking takes to bring it to life. That's it. Grind as hard as possible to get something out TODAY! Amen.

You can keep iterating on it tomorrow, etc. but you need to have something to show by the end of the day today. Amen.
