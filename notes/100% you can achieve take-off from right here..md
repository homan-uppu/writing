you absolutely can.
and therefore, this isn't the time to shuffle things up.

you're smack dab in the middle of creating something quite interesting. sufficiently see it through before you give yourself to move and shuffle things up. see this through.

with a strong practice you can overcome all obstacles. the mind must be trained to forget the self and express itself naturally - without restriction.

achieving that state of mind requires internal work. the external environment honestly does not matter. what you have right here, right now, is more than enough. if you can forget the self when you work, then the environment you're in recedes into the background, eventually dissolving leaving just you and your object of focus.

that's what you ought to focus on.
