1. Build. That is it. Nothing else on agenda.

Musashi was right: the Way exists in everything you do. Every act of creation has a common foundation in the self. By digging deeper and understanding yourself and calming the mind, you will be able to create much more powerful works of art.

**A work of art reflects the depth of the mind of the creator.**

Stop dreaming about SF. When the time is right it will happen. Or it may not. That's not in your hands. Just focus on building a great product - the best you can possibly craft. Amen.

Remember, there is no competition. Just simply losing yourself in your creation. Treat this as a meditation to train your mind. That is all you have to think about / worry about. Godspeed brother.

I also feel that in another year I'm going to be able to start dabbling in making films if I want given the AI leverage. Sora needs to release, and other models need to get better and then I can ship something incredible, quickly. I'm looking forward to that day, but I'm also going to be very patient. Time flies quickly anyway, there's no need to crave for future state. Revel in the present moment.
