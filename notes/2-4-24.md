- Clean up Twitter and laser focus on the Product design, film. That's it. 2 Lists. Be intentional about this, who you follow and engage with will determine the quality of your output.
- New Twitter profile and feel. Stick to JI, that's definitely my identity from here on out. Own it, and drive forward with it. Commit to it fully, without any second guessing.
- Design.
- Product doc: with every single detail for what you want and why in this app, what is the MVP, some thoughts on how you might evolve it, etc.

Ideas that struck me:
- Education will eventually become direct to consumer, without the regulated "government" layer that currently sits between teachers and students. We're already seeing this right now, and if you're in the bubble that I'm in, then you'd think that all learning happens the way we learn (online), yet the majority of 20 years olds in the world right now have spent most of their education time going through institutional programs for most of their lives. Coupled with UBI (or government funds specifically for education), quality of learning will drastically improve. What's holding us back right now is slow to change institutions and government regulation and policy. (Need to study the regulation around homeschooling in the US).
- Product creation is artistry.
