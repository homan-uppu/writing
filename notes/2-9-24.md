Today is about not wasting a single moment. Optimize everything. Move fast, not rushed.
1. Research OMAD for 10 mins. (Reinforce)
1. Product design + doc. **That spells out exactly what needs to be built**, and how. To the minutest details. Do not move forward until this is absolutely finalized.
2. SwiftUI and start building.

That's it. Do nothing which is of no use.

Today's sit was full of drowsiness. Still getting used to the new time, waking up at 3:30. But that's fine. Build the skill to combat this drowsiness.

Add a sit this afternoon to compensate for the poor morning sit.

Put more effort in tomorrow's morning sit. Be victorious over drowsiness. It's possible. It's a skill like any other.

Be patient. Your brain is starting to brainstorm possibilities prematurely. Keep it focused on the most minimal first version of the app. Keep it there until this version is complete and you're using it on a regular basis.

Just focus and execute on the details, and everything else will take care of itself. Perfect each interaction, each messaging, absolutely everything. Build the mind that does the details exceptionally well.
