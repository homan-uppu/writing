Damn. Obsidian really is a great tool. I like writing in this. And I like writing while being able to see the words that I write. I now strongly feel that computer writing is the best way to write after you've thought something through sufficiently well. When you haven't, stick to pen and paper as that gives you the freedom to explore an idea with far greater degrees of freedom.

I need to wrap up the essay draft. I'm feeling my attachment to subtrees that I should not be exploring in depth. This is not the time to delve deep into any subtree. Learn to cut. Just show how counterintuitive it is to act optimally in an extremely asymmetric world. That's the most important outcome of this thinking exercise.

I think the progress is going well. I just need to reign in the mind and put it where it needs to be, without any distractions. Amen.
