The leverage from doing one thing well before moving onto the next thing is incredibly high.

Spend time thinking about the simplest explanation for "Fear equality". There certainly is one. I need to get this right before sharing it widely and building on top of it. Be patient. Once you build the ability to communicate the essence powerfully, the force multiplier will be incredibly high.
