1. Need to improve "Fear Equality". It needs work. I'm not making the primary point. And there is no need to dig into education - push this to a later essay.
2. List of all the heuristics. Each will be its own essay.
3. One final "How to educate yourself" essay that is a compilation of all the learnings from the above, with the foundation of how the world is changing, directed towards an 18 year old in today's world.

After this it will be time to figure out what is next. Don't even explore what's next before you complete all of this writing. Amen. This is the right strategy. The "How to educate yourself" will lead to what I need to do because all of my actions will be directly related to enabling people to educate themselves in this world. This is all that matters to me.

...

I need to get rid of my personal communication channels and stick to a single "inbox" that is tied to Jisnu. A single entry point for the world to reach me. Absolutely. No more engaging on personal channels for anything work related. Amen.
