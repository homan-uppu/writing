Do I even need to publish "No room for average"? Won't this just take care of itself? In the sense that if I'm trying to discover the ambitious, why will this essay help? It's not necessary for those with sufficient ambition.

But it is a necessary foundation for my thinking. It is something that I need.

"The path is too difficult to walk."

I can't change the first essay to be positive because I need to focus on the suffering.

1. Suffering
2. Origin of suffering.
3. There can be an end to suffering.
4. The path to ending suffering.

"There is no room for average" covers 1 - 3 because it hints that in order to get what you want you will need to be more ambitious, and more great at what you do, than ever.

The next set of essays are all about what that path is.

This works. This is the way to do this.

And no feedback from friends on these essays. From here on out, it's me and the world. I'm going to find my tribe. That is it.

I'm just on a creative expression journey. That is all I'm going to fucking do. On my timeline. That is it. There is nothing left to do. Amen.
