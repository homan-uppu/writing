- Flesh out the piece on education. Publish it tonight (or in the next hour).
- Start the next essay: **solve for people**. Talk about the complexity of feeling. This is an important topic for me. I need to make good sense of it.
- Website work: make it easier to publish from phone? I would like that. I would like to be able to edit on the fly. Have a CMS. Make the presentation more minimal. Do periodic backups of posts so they don’t get lost. Differentiate between long and short posts (on landing page).
- Create new Apple account for Jisnu, and just use that moving forward. Or update current iCloud account by dumping all photos and everything. Basically clear up the entire phone, and make it strictly productive. Amen.

I want a mobile only creation process. Have this and then keep publishing your ideas on mobile. This is a bomb setup.

There is no better sitting posture as well. It’s perfect. Lean into it.
