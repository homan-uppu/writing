Time to think through what I'm going to create this year.

I'm going to dedicate this year (until June 7, 2025) to establishing the foundation of my practice (8foldpath), as I publish ideas. That's it. As long as I'm sticking to the practice, and dedicating time to creating & publishing, I'm good. That's it.

Of these two, the more important aspect is the practice. I must build a strong mental foundation. It's a force multiplier for life itself. Nothing else is more important.
