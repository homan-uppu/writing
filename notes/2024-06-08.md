Today's writing:

God is testing your patience. You will have a late rise. But rise you will. Keep at it. Don't celebrate anything. Don't feel dejected about anything. Only the labor is in your hands. Not the fruits of it. Accept whatever the results are with a smile. Get back to work.

What will I write about? OK, the maximizing transactions is interesting, but I think there's a better, more personal story here. Nope, I'm going to write and publish maximizing transactions is all we want. No two ways about it.
