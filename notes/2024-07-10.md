1. **Practice and routine** - the foundation. Define what this is and actually execute this. Most of your time should be going towards this. Absolutely.
2. The approach for **zerofactorial**. So far, my thinking has been absolutely all over the place. That's fine. That's a good way to start the process. But, now it's time to really reign in the thinking and focus. The best way to reign it in is through writing. Write one long, comprehensive memo detailing everything this project entails, including why I'm going to work on it. Every useful thought (for this stage), distilled. Through the writing, identify the priorities, and the right order of priority. And attack it in exactly that order, without letting the mind wander to unnecessary things. Amen.

- It's going to be harder than you think. You need to allocate more time than you think you need to in order to hit the standard that you want.
- Over internet consumption is polluting and rotting the mind. Reign it in. Operate without the internet for most of the day. Only turn it on when it's absolutely necessary. In pre-determined blocks of time. That's hte best way to approach this.
