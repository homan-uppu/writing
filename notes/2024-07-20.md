Just get back to the writing grind. No matter where you go, you keep coming back to this. When there is nothing to turn to, just keep writing.

There's no need to get caught up in a bunch of other things. Just f'n write. Express the ideas that you have. Naturally. Authentically. Without worry of judgement. And put yourself out there.

You keep wanting to skip this and skip that. Hilarious.

This is definitely somewhat interesting if you ask me. Amen brother. Amen.
