This is no way to live life.
There is something fundamentally wrong with how I'm living life at the moment.
I need change.
ASAP.

Wow. I can't believe the mind has fallen to this level.
Pull yourself out of this pity party
Get back to the grind.

The sad thing is, I can't even concentrate my mind on one thing. I can't lose myself in the work. It's almost certainly a biological thing - because once I started fasting, I could totally get back to the grind (just a few months ago).

Damn.
