You must subdue the mind.

That is the only way you can survive, let alone thrive. Intense agitation in the body today. I suspect it's due to the overconsumption of caffeine this morning. I need to not do that again.

A strong daily practice is required. For the first few sits in the day, cut yourself some slack until you improve. Allow yourself to fall back and lay on your back for a few minutes during a sit (or in between sits). If your mind is feeling drowsy take the short naps. That's OK. When you wake up get right back into a serious sit.

The process is going to look quite messy until you bring the mind to greater balance. There is unfortunately no shortcut whatsoever. You just have to sit with all of the discomfort inside of you.
