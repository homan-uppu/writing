1. Need to knock out this essay.
2. Solution-ing thoughts (as you uncover the problem, you should naturally start thinking about what might work).
3. Some thoughts on the series of essays here - the more I write this one, the greater clarity I have about that.

Get this essay to the highest bar of quality that you can do on your own. The highest. I don't care how many iterations it takes, you must do this. Why? Because that's the only way to learn. Subsequent essays will be quicker to get to a higher bar.

This is the only kind of work that I want to do right now. I have too many thoughts on the world that I need to formulate and put out there. I feel like my head would explode if I didn't. Wow.

I've never been this convinced about a direction before. I feel great pursuing this. The craft of communicating an idea well is exhilarating. Amen.
