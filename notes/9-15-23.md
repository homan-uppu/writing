1. Knock out the draft. Get it ready for the editing process. It's time to take this to the next level.

This is the process. There's no better way to build actionable clarity about the world.

Sections to think through:
- Defining **standardization** (or renaming this to a better term).

Standardization, when it works, is economically efficient, and spawn

Non-creative domains can be standardized to enable these efficiencies.

This is also why, to the extent possible, people want to standardize: it's simpler to optimize for, and a market is created around standards.

For example, the standard that I'm most familiar with: IIT-JEE prep in India, and from what I can tell - the rest of Asia as well. The more clear cut the standard, the bigger the market.

But standards are fragile: when they no longer translate to competence, the entire system built around the standard crumbles because the market no longer rewards the standard.

Any standard not in tune with the market (in unregulated domains) will fall.
