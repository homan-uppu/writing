- **Write down your plan for this phase.**
- Do a braindump of learnings from convo re. "Why college is outdated". Also, I don't think that's the right title. - will need to refine / reposition this.
- Reinforce the need to sit. I want to get in 3 hours a day. There's no other way to get through this phase.

I'd like 2 drafts complete by the end of today. It's an ambitious target, but it needs to be done.
