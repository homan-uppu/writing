**Must**:
1. College outdated draft. (get a good draft out). Would like to send this out this evening for feedback.
2. Some thoughts on the **AI copilots for education** angle. - I actually think this is an essay (based on Shuhari). - there's a bigger picture AI for education angle here that's quite important to think through. The communication / writing copilot is a piece of a much larger puzzle.

**Maybe**
2. How my competitiveness has held me back draft (Succinct. This goes on Twitter as well - as a longer post / thread).
3. Build the list on X - for people to get feedback from (for the "On communicating well" essay).

I'm down for this agenda. Mid October is when I'm going to be all guns blazing - such that by the end of the year, I must have some traction. Come what may. Do or die. This phase is to set up the foundation that will enable me to succeed.
