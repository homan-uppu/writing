Amplify the grind today.

1. Knock out the first essay draft quickly.
2. Get the site in order (remember - simple, to the point, but in a way that represents me).
3. Look to publish first essay today.

Makes sense. Go for a walk, and then come back and knock out the writing. Amen.

Personal "status" doesn't matter at all. Work hard to have the impact that's worth having: i.e. by scaling the best personalized education to make people smarter - to enable them to thrive in this world.

That's it. That's absolutely all you need to focus on. Everything you do ought to enable progress towards this mission. Amen.
