as much as i keep analyzing spaces, nothing beats DD colony. that's the cold, hard truth. the delivery infrastructure: literally everything is dropped off to your door. 

BLR is just a crowded mess. terrible infrastructure. and massive $ drain. it gets old really f'n fast.

a high rise building is going to require a 2bhk, which is a big, unnecessary commitment. but honestly, one that i can do

pay 50k / mo or something like that. partially to live in, and have my creative studio in the other half.
