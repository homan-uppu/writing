This is what I'm feeling right now.
Nothing more feels important.

Yesterday I looked at the world. Most of us have absolutely no idea how to build more peaceful minds. And the ones who do know choose not to walk the path seriously because it's so difficult.

I'm going to dedicate myself to studying the Truth during this phase. Nothing is more important. No need to chase any form of "self expression" or that nonsense. Just study the Truth and write whatever comes to mind.

I'm also feeling the pull for a much deeper drive to studying the Truth. By much deeper I mean dedicating weeks if not months studying. And just studying. No writing. No speaking even. Just sitting in silence observing what is happening inside. There is no need for anything else because this is the most important thing to be done. Amen.

This is actually all that needs to be done. I know I can't start anything at the moment because if I do, I'm not going to see it through because I'm going to feel a pull back in the direction of studying the Truth within. So it's just not going to work.

I have no desire to go to the hustle bustle of SF / NYC / Tokyo / anywhere in the world. I know all I'm going to get there is distraction. My attention will be pulled at aggressively towards the external world. But, the real work happens internally alone. I intuitively know that.

This path of studying my self feels like what I'm meant to do. The "answer" is certainly within. There is nothing outside that can give me what I want. It's all internal.

My mind is far too bound by conditioning. The conditioning that I've allowed to shape my mind. My mind is poisoned at its depth. I must work out of it. I must break through the limitations of my own mind. There are so, so many limitations of the mind right now. I can't write them out, but I feel it. I feel the limitations. I feel my mind not being able operate at the level that I know is possible to operate at.

It's a constant nagging feeling that I'm not walking the obviously better path.

Even from a regret maximization standpoint, I would have absolutely no regrets on this path. On the other hand, I would definitely regret missing out on the opportunity to understand and master my mind in pursuit of worldly things that are obviously fleeing, unsubstantial, and lacking essence.

The only work that is meaningful is one that is not done by me, but simply facilitated by me. And in order to do that kind of work I need to stop doing. There is so much "doing" inside of me right now. There is so, so much unnecessary effort that I'm putting forth.

The mind needs to be operated very, very differently. I'm far from wielding it effectively.

***Heedful among the heedless, wakeful among those asleep, just as a fast horse advances, leaving the weak behind: so the wise**.* - Dhammapada.

This is the path. There is absolutely nothing to fear on this path. In fact, not walking on this path is to be feared.

You know the path. You've taken a baby step on the path. You have a sense for what it is. You have the desire to walk the path. You have the youth and vitality required to sustain yourself on this path for a long time - which is required to achieve the depth that is necessary for transformation.

***The monk delighting in heedfulness, seeing danger in heedlessness, advances like a fire, burning fetters great & small. The monk delighting in heedfulness, seeing danger in heedlessness —incapable of falling back— stands right on the verge of Unbinding.***

***As long as evil has yet to ripen, the fool mistakes it for honey. But when that evil ripens, the fool falls into pain.***

***An evil deed, when done, doesn’t—like ready milk— come out right away. It follows the fool, smoldering like a fire hidden in ashes.***

The lag:

***Even the evil meet with good fortune as long as their evil has yet to mature. But when it’s matured that’s when they meet with evil.*** 
***Even the good meet with bad fortune as long as their good has yet to mature. But when it’s matured that’s when they meet with good fortune.***

***A special transmission outside the scriptures***  
***Not founded upon words and letters;***  
***By pointing directly to [one's] mind***  
***It lets one see into [one's own true] nature and [thus] attain Buddhahood***
