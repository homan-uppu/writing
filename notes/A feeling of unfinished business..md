That's precisely how I feel right now. It's an interesting feeling of something "pulling me back". As if I can't escape it no matter how hard I try.

I'm going to build a company. There is no fucking way around it. I'm succumbing to my destiny.

Of course, the company won't be some "regular" company. I'm inspired by folks like Kunal who use a company as a vehicle to attack a problem, and that vehicle carries in it a product, story, creativity, filmmaking, anything you can imagine that will help solve the problem. That's the approach that I like. That's the approach I'm going to adapt.

Build a stronger mind in the process.
Lean into the practice like never before.
Perfect Sila, Samadhi. Allow the Panna to unfold. Yet, the effort must be there.
