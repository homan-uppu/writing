Most people when they think of Indian philosophies, think of rigid religions that have had their discovery phases in the past, that are now set in stone. They think of Jainism, Sikhism, Buddhism, Hinduism, etc. Some "ism" or the other. Each organized around some body of knowledge, a set of people who shared their thoughts with the world.

Yet, these rigid religions were born out of a vibrant marketplace of competing ideas. The "land of gods" was also produced one of the earliest recorded [atheistic philosophies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80stika_and_n%C4%81stika).

Ancient India (more accurately: the region we now call "India") was the "Silicon valley of self understanding". In the same way entrepreneurs in San Francisco build competing products the world wants, in a search for the truth about what the world wants, ancient India was full of seemingly insane individuals who took to caves & mountains to spend days, months, years in complete solitude observing the nature of their minds, and sharing their discoveries with others. These explorers only differed in what they were seeking to understand.

Kings, rich merchants were the venture capitalists: they'd fund large universities, monasteries, etc. to enable systematizing knowledge.

The lay population were like angel investors: feeding these wandering ascetics, seekers, inner explorers in the hope that they'd discover something valuable about the human condition and teach others how to live to be more at peace.

Over time, instead of putting forth the effort to understand ourselves, we took the easier path: idolize, deify these "researchers", codify their knowledge and take it to be some divine message that is absolutely true and should not be argued against.

Critical thinking was replaced with blind faith.
Field notes turned into divine scriptures that can't be challenged.

Gaining understanding is a process of tinkering, experimentation, exploration, improving the prevailing wisdom about it.

Even if some of the philosophies produced by ancient India were profound, by forgetting the importance of the ecosystem: the free market of ideas that led to such profound discoveries, we make a grave mistake.

Progress in any domain of knowledge requires a free market of ideas. When we forget this truth, knowledge becomes polluted. Wisdom becomes delusion.

A free market not only produces great ideas, it protects their vitality.
