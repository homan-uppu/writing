I saw her briefly, from atop a walking bridge.
I was captivated by her beauty. A sort of beauty that wasn't just physicality, but also a kind that radiated pure joy. I could tell she was happy with her path in life. She had just completed her Yoga course.

Not sure where she was off to next, but it was clear that she was in no hurry. Savoring each moment. Blissed out in a way.

That's the kind of energy I would like to spend my life with. Radiant joy. Comfortable with the simple life. Doesn't require much. Doesn't chase after material possessions. Doesn't crave luxuries. Simple. For whom a small piece of land in the midst of nature is enough.

I have a lot to work on before I reach the level to attract someone like that.
Keep practicing and leave the rest to Nature.
