Education has many valuable components of which training / mentorship is just one of them. In my view, education must help with:
- **Discovery**: enabling a student to discover their unique talents, their natural strengths.
- **Training**: enabling a student to become excellent at their craft.
- **Credentialing**: successful graduates are “stamped” such that the world notices & values them for graduating even before they may do great work. In a world with so much noice, signaling competence is incredibly valuable for students to enable them to access resources and connect with the right people quickly.
- **Community**: ambitious, highly motivated, set of peers is invaluable. Most valuable learning happens through osmosis with the right peers.

These features of education go hand in hand, and I believe all of them are critically important. Let's see how personal tokens would enable each.
