This is what you need.

Some progress to build momentum. With baby steps.

The writing is fixed. There's absolutely no need to change this whatsoever. Just keep at it. Grind through it and build the ability to publish great writing, at will. That's a critical skill you need to do anything worthwhile in this world. It will help you think better and improve your judgement & decision making.

So yeah, there's no other path than to write these 7 essays. Once you're done, you're going to identify the mountain to climb, and you're going to methodically climb it. That's it. That's all you can do.

And have the right mindset: i.e. Karma yoga this shit.
