That's what I have.

I started off wanting to do a 30 day course. Realized on the first day that I wouldn't be able to do more than 10. And after 3 days I ended it.

I underestimated the importance of the right environment for a noob like me.

I need to become much stronger. I'm going to become much stronger.
Until I've built up significant strength, I'm not going to attempt longer full fledged courses from home (only up to 3 days).

I'll leave the longer courses for the centers. Or in specific areas that are conducive to the practice (nature, quiet).

I'm not yet at the strength to sustain such a course in the environment that I'm in (surrounded by many people in adjacent homes). Unless of course I have no other option.

I also went into this with a significant dopamine addiction (which I realized on the first day itself). Too much content consumption. Too much reading. Too much nonsense.

I have a lot to modify about my lifestyle in order to be able to build the strength that I need.

There are a lot of changes that I need to bring into my life from now onwards. Urgently.
