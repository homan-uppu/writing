- The Introduction is clear enough, precise, and makes me curious about the idea.   
    The order of second and third paragraph can be reversed. Also, the main focus is on token-holders selling their stakes in companies, which may be restrictive for the rest of your idea’s potential. This issues comes up at bunch of other places too, but I’m mentioning it here because the introduction will set the stage for whatever follows. In case, you do really want to focus on this, it would be good idea to focus on themes of “fostering entrepreneurship” etc.  
      
    
- The core-emotion does resonate but you need to expan upon how this idea empowers individuals, and how it’s different from the financial/lending instruments that already exist. So, the FAQ that compares the Network with college debt needs to come up early, and you can make other such comparisons that clearly put forth the idea’s value propositions.  
      
    
- Organization is the part with most scope for improvement. Also, in my experience, structuring is what keeps people reading any non-fiction piece of writing. 
    

  

You have 4 broad things to cover in the whitepaper:  
  
→ What is it? (The introduction of your idea)

→ Why we need it? (Use-cases)  
→ How does/will it work? (Implentation)  
→ How do we start? (GTM plan + Sales pitch)  
  
Everything should ideally fit into this broad structure, and currently the hierarchy of content is not clear. For example, under ‘Trust’ when you mention that the Network should be Trustworthy, Predictable, and Honest, I expect the sections that follow to be directly connected to these attributes. To some extent they are—decentralization contributes to honesty, say, or rules of admission foster more trust—but the connections are somewhat tenuous.

  

I believe a lot could be achieved here by tweaking the headings slightly and implementing what is called ‘parallelism’ in language.  
(The dictionary definition is, “the use of successive verbal constructions in prose which correspond in grammatical structure, sound, metre, meaning, etc.”)

What it means simply is that your bullet points, headings, or even clauses in a sentence have to be consistent. 

  

If one heading is ‘Trust’ (a noun with at least two meanings), then the others cannot be ‘Sufficiently Decentralized’ (adjective phrase), Reputation (another noun, yay), and Admission (another noun), etc. Since you are talking about Implementation in this particular example, I’d suggest alternatives like Trustworthy, Sufficiently Decentralized, Reputable, Governed by Rules of Admission, etc. To give an example via bullet points,  
  

  

- would have a sufficiently granular "score" so that different kinds of fraud would impact reputation according to how badly they impact the Network.
    
- quickly uncovers gaps between what a user claims is true and reality through a [community notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Notes) design, but also with a way to financially reward contributors based on their performance.
    

The better way would be,  
  

- would have a sufficiently…
    
- would quickly uncover…
    

  

A few other things

  

→ It would be a better idea to stick with the same personas throughout in videos, examples, use-cases etc. Instead of having Alice and Amy, maybe just have Alice. 

→ A question came to my mind early on that if X owns equity in Y’s token, and Z owns equity in X’s token, then how are Z and Y related? It is addressed later on, but you may want to move it up. It would be better to ask other people if they also got this question much before it was addressed in the paper. 

→ A section on ‘How the Network differs from A, B, C financial instruments’ would be really helpful. 

→ Remove the democracy example from Decentralization. Feels a bit off, considering all the profound philosophical work on democracy that is also quite popular. 

→ Assertions like “the US has the greatest concentration of highly ambitious individuals in the world today” reveal too much subjectivity in opinion and are generally not considered a good idea in non-fiction.  
On that note, also think about how much you want to write in first-person pov. 

→ The first two paragraphs in ‘Raise money’ look identical/confusing. 

→ Typo: “As with with personal tokens”

→ At some places, I found myself wondering about the audience being addressed—investors or regular token-holders?—and it would be a good idea to have a note-attached to each paragraph or section (just for your own eyes) that says whom you are targeting with it. Just a thought, not a hard suggestion. It would also help push  pain-pleasure narratives for different audiences. 

→ As mentioned earlier, there is a lot of focus on your idea’s implementation in the science-tech-startup ecosystem (for example, both the use-cases given after ‘Capital distribution’ are rooted in science). Even if this makes more sense to you financially, I believe adding use cases from other fields would make the idea more appealing and give it a revolutionary edge. For instance, independent journalists benefit from this sort of financing? Can it to do something to solve the museum-collector dependeny of the art market? Having this stuff in there will also make the narrative more vibrant, and your promises more convincing. 

→ By the time we reach the latter part of Implementation and move towards Governance, the tone becomes slightly defensive, then reaches a high pitch by the time we come to the first FAQ. That can be easily solved with a quick rewrite. 

→ A question I was still left with after reading through to the end:  
  

Is a personal token representative of the person’s net worth, for example their inheritance as well, or only of their financial gains after they sign up to the Network?
