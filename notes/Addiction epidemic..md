The modern human's struggle can be boiled down to one thing: staving off addiction.
If you can stave off addiction, everything else takes care of itself.
You're happier, stronger, and are far more likely to get what you want in this world: you're working with a fundamentally more powerful mind.
### Addiction changes the brain
You can see and think more clearly. Addiction warps our thinking in ways that we can't even see while addicted.
(There is some literature about how addiction literally changes the neural pathways of the mind).
### Instead of tackling addiction, we just change its definition.
This is the biggest problem in our ability to tackle addiction.
We've somehow accepted that carrying around attention grabbing devices in our pockets that would leave us in agitation if we were to be separated for more than a couple of days.
### Pre-existing addictions of the human condition
Most of us are addicted to our families, to our friends, partners, etc. This is a more fundamental addiction that has existed in us since the dawn of our existence.
