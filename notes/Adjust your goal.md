Focus on creating what you love. 
What you're naturally inclined to create. With a beginner's mind, but with ferocity.

Focus on products / services that can create 10 super fans, that may want to pay you $5 each. That's it. That's all you need.

Each project can be incredibly small. In fact, they should be tiny - at the start. Once you build momentum, you can start to aim a bit bigger.
