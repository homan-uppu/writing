In order to ensure that the Network consists of ambitious, long-term oriented individuals, it's tempting to be selective about who can get into the Network. But, this will backfire because being selective means that the Network functions at the wrong level of abstraction: instead of operating at the level of an open platform that supports different notions of what it means to be "investable", it operates at a level below: a selective, opinionated, sub-Network.

The Network should NOT be selective about who can join the Network beyond the bare minimum such as barring individuals who have been convicted of fraud in the world, as well as meeting any legal / regulatory requirements such as minimum age, etc.

Users will then be able to form their own "collectives" (or sub-Networks) within the Network which can be opinionated about who gets in. Collectives, in the world of companies, are like startup accelerators (like YCombinator) which have their own admission criterion, and invest in individuals that it accepts. The Network should be able to support many competing collectives each with their own admissions criterion, etc.

In other words, the burden to determine who is good to invest falls on the investors, not on the Network.
