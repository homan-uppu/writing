Create one short film (< 5 mins long) that you're truly proud of. An honest attempt.

Do nothing else until this is complete. Commit to it strongly. If it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out. That's fine. This is still incredibly valuable experience no matter what you do next because you're sharpening the most fundamental skill of all: *to elicit feeling*.

Study humans. Study what makes us petty. Silly. Hilarious. Tragic. Study the human condition. Study yourself.

This will be a worthwhile endeavor. I promise.

And *accept the crap inside of you*. It's that crap that will make for great art. Observe detachedly your pettiness, anger, fears, lust, everything. Every single quality that pulls you down. Also observe the positive qualities that enable you to rise. Study the conflict between the two.

Apply calculation / rational mind after the fact to gauge which imagination is worth developing further. Amen.
