Two individuals living a solo life can have drastically different outcomes.

One can isolate themselves in an apartment, eating microwave food, play video games, watch movies, consume content, satiate their urges through pornography, and drink a glass or two to "take the edge" off of the day so that they can sleep well. Over the course of weeks this person is bound to become depressed. They'll become less likely to engage with others, and when they do, they'll be struck with anxiety. Their mind will slowly, but surely, descend into darkness.

It's incredibly difficult to manage the mind when devoid of human connection. We desperately try to fill that void with all sorts of distractions that pale in comparison to the real thing: engaging with people in-person, looking into their eyes and feeling their very real presence in front of you.

For most people (myself included), I think it's safe to say that socialization is an important aspect of maintaining a healthy mind. Socialization helps us get out of our heads and keeps that dreaded feeling of alone-ness at bay. We're meant to connect with others meaningfully. We are programmed to derive great fulfillment from human connection.

Yet, there are those who isolate themselves, study their mind, better understand their habits, and train themselves to become stronger, better, and more calm. When they are seen, they seem to be more at peace with themselves, and more present and positive when engaging with others. There is a possibility for positive transformation through solitude.

There's an art to solitude.

I care a lot about understanding myself, i.e., understanding the human condition. And those who I consider to have achieved a great understanding have all reinforced the notion that for matters related to understanding what we are, how our minds work, and training our minds to be the way we want them to be, solitude is essential.

When we are with people, many parts of our mind are active that prevent us from seeing ourselves as we truly are. We morph ourselves to appear a certain way so that we're liked by others. We cover up inadequacies... or interestingly, we share our inadequacies so that we appear to be "vulnerable" because we believe that others appreciate vulnerability. Whatever you do, no matter how "authentic" you think you're being in the moment, there is always that subconscious process running which carefully crafts how you present yourself so that you're liked by others.

This was an evolutionary requirement. Those who were hated by the tribe weren't just left alone to "chill". They were ostracized, hunted, silenced, or killed. Those who didn't care about being liked by others weren't likely to pass on their genes.

It's tempting to push back and give examples of people who don't seem to care what people think about them. Even those people are far from actually not caring, they just might be a bit better than the rest of us.

In solitude, this subconscious craving to appear a certain way isn't as activated, allowing us to better see the crap that we really are, beneath the pristine, polished, image of ourselves that we're constantly trying to project into the world. And understanding what we actually are is required to be able to change ourselves to be something else.

Our individual evolution depends on self-understanding. If we can't even see the crap that's within us, what hope is there to overcome it.

- Understanding the human condition is valuable in every valuable human endeavor though it might not seem like it. Why is understanding how people work valuable for, say, making sense of some law in physics? Collaboration is often required to get to the heart of matters. Even those who've discovered things in isolation are adept at presenting their findings in ways that will allow others to build on top of their work. Every worthwhile endeavor eventually feeds into the collective. It is inherently social. There are likely many discoveries lost to us because the person who discovered it wasn't skilled enough to, or didn't bother to, share it with the world.

- Solitude is invaluable for:
	- Understanding the human condition.
	- Originality.
	- Taking a step back from the drama, and settling into the bigger picture. You need space from the emotional dramas that are constantly taking place in every social environment.
