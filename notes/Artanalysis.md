Two art critics intensely study a painting. They intellectualize the beauty of it. They notice the lines, the shapes, the contrast. They explore the *symbolism* in it.

Meanwhile one of their children behind them draws nonchalantly on a piece of paper.

During the discussion the paper flies into their lap. They're transfixed by its greatness, as the child gets up and runs outside to play.

The silliness of intellectualizing art.
