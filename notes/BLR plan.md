going to double down on Ashtanga yoga practice with Gururaja in HSR layout.
i'm going to rent a place there for a year lease (and will be OK bouncing early if need be).
## budgeting
currently have 18L.
i'm not going to go below 8L - this is my bare minimum emergency fund, i cannot go below that.

up front costs:
- 12k flight
- 10k few days rent at hotel / airbnb.
- 1.5L desk and chair setup.
- 1L deposit.
- 40k registering an LLC and setting up a new Mercury account?
- 10k cooking utensils (pan, pot, fridge?).
(3L up front)

recurring living:
- 35k rent
- 3k yoga
- 3k internet
- 4k maid
- 2k utilities.
- 4k on water cans (since i'll be bathing with this as well).
- 15k food (300 coffee + 200 food per day - cooking at home. i want to avoid cafes actually. just eat and grind out of home. keep things simple.)
(roughly: 60k / month).

recurring work:
- 15k / month on various services - including a buffer to spend on LLM inference costs during experimentation.

total: 80k / month.
this works out to be 5L for 6 months. 6.5L for 8 months.

IF my bank account reaches 8L, i'll need to pack bags and head back to Hyd. ideally i create value before that and don't have to go.

is this the game you want to play? it puts pressure on you to deliver something within a year. that pressure is fine. i welcome it.

or, do you want to play the safer game and go to Hyd after, say, a month on BLR.
In Hyd you can get by < 15k / month, and you can have a much larger emergency spend budget for compute / any resources you may need to ship great work.

that's the other thing with this plan: you won't have much of a budget to put towards the work you're going to do. e.g. if you want to shoot a great video, you're not going to be able to shell out much.

is this the way to play this game?

i'm def leaning towards it. the playing "safe" game in Hyd doesn't feel optimal whatsoever.
