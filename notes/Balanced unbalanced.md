Balanced internally. A calm mind is happier and more productive. There are no downsides.

Extremely unbalanced in how I go about life: instead of balancing multiple things, going all in on one thing.

You can’t fake obsession. You can only obsess about something if you actually love it. Always going all in shows you quickly what you’re meant to do and what you’re not. It’s the most efficient way to find what you love.

I believe we are most fulfilled when we do what we love. Becoming great at it is a natural byproduct of loving what you do.

When people say they need to take weekends off to do something else, or take a vacation, I suspect they don’t really like what they’re doing during the week. It’s unfortunate how this is seen as an inevitable aspect of “working”. I often see young people receive advice to not work weekends etc. whereas the right advice imo is to find something that feels like play such that you lose the notion of a “weekend” itself.

I strongly believe there exists at least one thing for each of us that we love to do, that we can naturally obsess over. Find it.

There is a certain inexplicable joy in working obsessively with teammates who are equally obsessed. It activates a primal feeling of belonging and sheer joy.

Don’t start a company (or band, or whatever) to make a ton of money, there are quicker ways. Start one to have the privilege of obsessing with others. There are few experiences like it.
