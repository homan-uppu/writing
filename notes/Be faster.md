I'm starting to agree w/ David Holz: 

"Many of my brilliant friends are paralyzed by their intellects. Thinking overwhelms doing. Many of my successful friends are less reflective, but quick to action. They are always focused on moving forward. Making as many 'probably correct actions' as possible. A winning strategy."

You need to act before you have a chance to think. Otherwise you'll psyche yourself out because any rational mind when it thinks through this path will shy away from it.

It's only the irrational mind that will pursue something that seems (and feels) batshit crazy.

So don't overthink it. Find the balance. And strike fast.

For example: you should be shipping ideas like the writing copilot really fucking quickly: like in a weekend - so that you can get a sense for it.

The problem with waiting IS the thinking. Lol.
At the same time, you do have to think because otherwise, you're not going to create the right thing.

Find the balance. Know when to strike. And bias towards action, not overthinking.

Tbh - you ought to be executing so fucking hard on every single idea, and operate the brain to be balanced enough so that you can move from one failure to the next without losing energy.

It's the losing energy that hurts. That's what you must avoid. Completely. Amen.

The fine-tuning to represent taste is where it's at. Seriously.

You have an incredible power to ship ruthlessly fast. So why not do that?

You also have to be incredibly careful about falling into short-term distractions - these are the things that will pull you away from what you committed to doing, and for the wrong reasons. Lol.
