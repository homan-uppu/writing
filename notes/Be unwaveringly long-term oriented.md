This is the space, the angle you're going to dedicate yourself towards. There's a necessary, meaningful contribution to be made in this space.

No matter what happens, you have to **push forward in this direction**. No giving up. If you need money, get some kind of part time job thing or borrow 10k to see yourself through till April (the rent term), and then move to a low cost arrangement.

But, realistically, you need to make some money. If you don't have some kind of breakthrough by the end of the year, you'll need to start some sort of business to begin generating revenue. You'll have no option but to sell your time for money, in order to survive.

But don't think about that state. In order to avoid it, focus on the road ahead: you have one and half months (by Nov 1) to get some form of traction on your ideas.

Here's the thing: all you need is a clear angle to run in. Once you have that, you should be in a position to raise a tiny round. You should build up your network by then (via the essays and outreach), such that in 3 months when you announce the direction you're going to work on and why, you should have enough of a network to raise. Amen.

That's the outcome to gun for. If you execute well, it will work out. Amen. Gun hard. Godspeed.
