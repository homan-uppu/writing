I've realized something important about my mind.
In its weakest moments, it craves to deviate from the path I've chosen for myself.

This deviation stems from an underlying agitation. As Goenkaji calls it, a "kick from within". Before you know it, you're someplace you didn't expect to be, doing something completely mis-aligned with what you set off to do. This jump isn't due to some creative breakthrough, but rather due to agitation that pulls you in the direction it wants you to go in, not in the direction you should be going in.

These kicks have pulled me down in life. I'm not going to let that happen anymore.

For this upcoming year, I'm simply going to create. No company. No filmmaking. Nothing but publishing my thoughts about the topics I find most important: how the world is changing. I'm going to see the future and write about it. That's it. Nothing else makes sense. I'm going to write as I train my mind to be established in mindfulness.

If I have ideas for a company or project, I'll write about it and reach out to people I can collaborate with to start fleshing out the idea with them. But we will not jump into it full time until at least June 7, 2025. I will not accept prematurely starting something without thinking it through sufficiently. Now, there may be exceptions to this, but, actually, there shouldn't be because if the idea is ambitious enough, you will have no choice but to take time to flesh out the path - because it will not be clear at all.

If you do collaborate, it will be an ideating sort of collaboration. Remember, with greater leverage, the possibilities grow by orders of magnitude, and the best paths become that much better than the rest of the paths. You must spend time thinking things through.

Buckle up brother. The game is just started. You've gotten started well. But you must be careful to not deviate. Think long-term. Balance the mind. Be patient. Attack. And guard the mind cautiously: the moment you succumb to your craving for external validation, you lose the balance required to do great work. The path is as narrow as a razor's edge. Walk it well.
