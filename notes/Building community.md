I think this is super important. And I need to do a better job at this. Seriously.

Use writing, and building, as a means to do this. Have a plan. A set of people that I want to connect with, and a clear reason I'd want to.

I need to work on this skill to build connections, a community of people working on cool things. Amen.

This is the only way to do it. Don't linger on the past. Don't fret about the future. Focus on the step that you're taking, as you take it. Amen.
