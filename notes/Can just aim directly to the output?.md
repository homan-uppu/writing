There's no need to write essays on the heuristics. You can just leverage them to execute. But: the execution is enabling others to follow the right heuristics right? Absolutely. So you have no choice but to write. Absolutely.

In fact, even as you design what to create and why, writing is how you'll do it. Absolutely.

Follow the shortest path of essays you need to build the education system that replaces them all. That is it. And then jump into implementing it (which is writing!). And there definitely is an implementation here that is quite powerful. Find it.

But, think about this: that can directly be the next essay right? Possibly. The timeline is shrunk. You don't need a few months or a year to get here. It's literally the next essay. The plan to completely redefine global education to be better. Amen. And in fact, that essay will contain all of the heuristics in a succinct way, and then the system to build is the one that will maximize the right individuals' ability to best apply those heuristics.

This completely sets the priorities. Take the fastest path to implementation. Yup. This is the priority. The focus. The time to launch is much, much sooner than anticipated. Remember, in a highly leveraged world things manifest much quicker than you think. You just have to seek the best path which is orders of magnitude more impactful and double down on it, without preconceived notions about how long it's going to take.

Here's a path:
1. Fear equality (explaining the rapid shift in the world)
2. How to thrive within accelerating asymmetry (optimal path) - there's probably a more 
3. What I'm going to do about this.
