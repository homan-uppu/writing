1. No useless content consumption.
2. No being over "plugged into" the ecosystem.
3. Stronger meditation practice. Weekly 1 - 2 day self course. Ideally someplace relatively remote. That I can drive to. Meditate. And drive back all within a single day. - Find such a place close to home and take advantage of it. Also, make a trip to Srisailam to scout spaces for a multi day course (up to 3 days) - that I could use maybe once or twice a month.
4. Impeccable Sila. Impeccable noble speech. Do not get entangled with anything that pulls you away from a better mind. A better mind is the most important thing to optimize for.
5. I want to become someone who sees things through. Someone who gets the job done. No matter what. This is something I'm going to invest in about myself. This is something I'm going to change. I want to become a do-er, not remain a talker. I'm going to overhaul my personality to support this. To optimize for this.
