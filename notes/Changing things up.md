Something needs to change significantly.
Need to sit a lot more
Need to bring food back under control.

Inner agitation is strong. Need to build concentration and balance in the face of the mental turbulence.

Remember each thought carries weight. Be cautious.

One of the worst days Iâ€™ve had. All I can do is bounce back. Amen.

Need to practice a lot more! Amen.
