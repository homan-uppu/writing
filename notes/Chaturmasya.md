**July 17, 2024 and will end on November 12, 2024**

"Chaturmasya is reserved for penance, austerities, fasting, bathing in holy rivers and religious observances for all. Devotees resolve to observe some form of vow, be it of silence or abstaining from a favourite food item, or having only a single meal a day."

This is literally a godsend. The start of my serious practice coinciding with a pre-existing period of practice without me planning for it is a sign from the universe telling me to double down on this practice.

Intensely focus on the practice. 3 x 1 hr today for sure. Aug 1 onwards make that 3 x 1.5 hrs. (and perhaps 2 sessions back to back in the morning to get started). Whatever the plan is, I'm going to be very disciplined about the practice. There is no better way to live life. Amen.
