There is a contradiction here. On one hand, I say that I'm serious about the practice. On the other hand, I say that I want to make something meaningful for others to experience as well.

You can't fully optimize for both. If you choose both, one will naturally take the backseat at any given moment in time.

This is problematic. You need to clarify what you're going to optimize for right now, and dig into it. There is no other way.

If you're going to commit fully to self-realization, this is not the place to be. You're going to slowly, but surely, make the move to Uttarkashi and lead the life of a seeker. That would be the top priority, and you'd practice every single moment that you can (basically outside of deep sleep). Every moment is used solely for the practice. 

You would go to Gangotri / the vicinity, ask for a place in an Ashram, or rent a small room nearby, and work diligently.

If you optimize doing work for the world, make that a top priority, and use the practice to enable you to succeed (while also making it a valuable preparation for when you fully dive into it).

What's it going to be?

There's no choice here. I can't let go of creating something "for the world" because of my conditioning. Until I've done something sufficiently meaningful. I can't go there feeling that I can't even do this, how can I do the more difficult task of seeking Truth within.

BUT. This external game is never-ending. Whatever you achieve, you will always feel like there is more you can do. And there will be. And there will be many, many distractions along the way.

But, yes. I don't see a choice at the moment. I'm going to do something meaningful in the world, strengthen my mind through the process, and then renunciate everything when the time is right. OK. I buy that. I don't see any other way.
