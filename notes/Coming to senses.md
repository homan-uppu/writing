It takes a while to come to your senses and be better at seeing the world for what it is.
It's all just games of the mind. Games with very real consequences on wellbeing.

Fiction impacts reality. Reality impacts fiction.
But mostly fiction impacts reality. The crap stories that float around in our minds that we believe to be true whereas they're far from the truth... they're just stories, narratives, beliefs planted in us by the world.

Everything is just conditioned.
