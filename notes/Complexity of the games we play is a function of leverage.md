The games we play to get the things we want are much, much higher in complexity than the games we discussed above, leading to far greater asymmetry. 

Yet, complexity alone doesn't help us understand why asymmetry is growing. If the games we play are more complex than the board games we discussed, then why haven't we always seen a great deal of asymmetry?

The complexity of the games we play is a function of leverage. By leverage I simply mean the time it takes to turn an idea into reality. The greater the leverage available to you, the less time it takes you to turn your ideas into reality.

Any human progress increases leverage, and spreads it to more people. For example, when a dictatorship is replaced by a democracy, the citizens often gain leverage because they are more free and therefore can manifest their ideas that they previously couldn't. When a new technology is created, it reduces the time and effort to turn your idea into reality. 

Computers, internet, artificial intelligence, government policies, greater individual freedom, etc. all work to increase leverage in the world. [^3]

Greater leverage increases the complexity of the games we play in three ways:
1. By reducing the time per move.
2. By eliminating the need to play simpler games (because technology does it for us).
3. By increasing the possibilities within any game, thereby making the game more complex.

When it takes a long time to make a move, the underlying asymmetry doesn't manifest quickly. Imagine a game of chess where each move took 5 years to make. By the time the players die, their differences wouldn't be that apparent. It's not that the asymmetry wasn't there, but that it didn't have enough time to present itself.  Over the past decade technology has drastically reduced the time it takes to turn an idea into reality - i.e. the time it takes to make a move.

As leverage increases, we stop playing simpler games. Before we had computers, a large amount of time and effort was involved in keep track of numbers and basic numerical calculations. As we had better technology, we were able to shift more of our time to playing more complex games: figuring out what to create and how to create it.

And lastly, games that were always complex become more complex with leverage. Our ideas are subconsciously limited by the leverage we have available to us because our minds don't like to dream about things that it believes are impossible. Most filmmakers a century ago likely wouldn't have dreamt of making a film about intergalactic politics, and constrained their ideas to films that could take place in the normal world. As leverage increased, filmmakers were able to dream bigger and wider. Their minds opened up to more possibilities within the same game, making the game more complex.
