The practice is essential not just for inner peace / development, but also to do great work. Seeking truth effectively requires a balanced, concentrated mind. Train it. Tame it. Hone it.

Keep sharpening the concentration. Keep the mind concentrated, collected, unified. Train a mind that does not wander.

You don't need a fancy work environment, or any of that nonsense. All you need is a concentrated mind. That's what this phase is for. Train it well. 

Keep the mind away from what it should not be on. Keep it where you want it to be. When it leaves, pull it back gently. There is no other way to win.
