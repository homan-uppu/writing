**What about those who no one wants to invest in for whatever reason? Will they be left behind?**
We will need some sort of [Basic Income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income). With the ability to invest in individuals, basic income can be implemented as a form of investment. Each individual receives some money from the collective in exchange for giving up some equity of their assets to the collective - such that each person holds equity in every other person’s (who is in the same country or network) outcomes. They could even trade their equities in others in a marketplace. 

This would enable each of us to feel direct ownership in the success of others. One of the greatest cultural challenges we’ll need to deal with is how the rising inequality of outcomes creates a hateful us vs. them dynamic. If each person had direct equity in those that do end up becoming quite wealthy, it may lead to a more cohesive society in which there’s less hatred for those who create a lot of value because it directly benefits each of us. Taxing the wealthy and funneling it back to people through government spending sounds like the same thing, but it’s far from it. When those taxes are funneled through a government bureaucracy and little of it, if any, arrives in the hands of the average citizen, we don’t feel any sense of ownership over the success of the winners.

**Fraud**
There will certainly be people who will try to cheat others out of money. Those who will claim to have certain skills when they in fact don't. Or claim to want to explore a certain field, but end up just pocketing the money and running. Similarly, there will be many who say they'll invest money and end up not doing so.

We will need a good way to prevent fraud. High trust is invaluable. Without it, such a system will never be adopted widely.

**Mental health**
As AI becomes more powerful and individuals can raise money on their potential, society will feel more unequal than ever before. Each of us is evolutionarily programmed to feel envy. This was a productive emotion back when we were hunter gatherers with less creative work, and therefore had roughly equal outcomes. Back then, if a fellow tribesperson say, hunted one more animal than you, the feeling of envy was productive because it would push you harder on the next hunt to contribute more.

That same envy backfires today. In a highly creative, leveraged world, there will be some who will be unimaginably successful at very young ages. Some of your peers in high school will leave to work on their trillion dollar companies, feature films, global warming research, videos, cancer research, etc. This is excellent for all of us because it pushes our world forward, but the envy will eat into those who haven't de-conditioned their envy. And that's a very difficult thing to do, and much of that also requires some maturity that comes with age.

Similar to envy, each of us is programmed to derive a sense of self-worth by our contributions to our communities and society at large. Therefore, whether we want to or not, we will each feel greater pressure to discover what we can be great at and to work incredibly hard to be great at it, because you won't be able to contribute without being great at what you do. No amount of basic income will satiate our craving to be useful to society. We will need to overcome this outdated programming as well.

But, I see no choice in this matter. Enabling individuals to invest in each other is a natural progression of our species. It is as natural as the inventions of money, democracy, and companies.

### It is a matter of when, not if.
