Make all of your information consumption pass through this "gate".
## Product
### Minimum
- **Beautiful reading experience**. Should make me want to read.
- **Works offline**. Most of my consumption will be offline. On this computer / monitor setup (=> not even mobile is required).
- 3 categories of content: done, todo, later. For bad knowledge, just delete it from the system entirely.
- Mark as done / undone.
- Highlight.
- Annotate.
- Within a particular piece:
	- See all highlights / notes for that piece in a "feed". I will just look at these instead of reading the entire thing again when I come back to it.
- Handle epub, pdf, and general text. All rendered in a beautiful website format (scroll based, non-paginated).
- A "notes" box for each piece that I can put overall notes in / identifiers like tags, etc. for later one when that will become relevant.
- Represent everything in markdown files and json (for the annotations) so that it can be backed up in GIT.
### Would be nice
- Summarize the entire piece, or even just the highlighted region.
- Tagging.
- Search.
- Chrome plugin: to automatically parse and save content from the internet. 
- Online sync and to be able to 
- Accurate Youtube transcription generation correctly identifying the different speakers. This would be super helpful tbh. But, can find ways to get around this for the time being (i.e. run it through Claude to clean it up and add the right para breaks).
## Design notes
- Stellar. Beautiful. A mix of Linear and Notion in terms of the visual minimalism.
- A feel that makes me want to read. And read actively with the intention to take notes where necessary. That is the key. There will be a lot of good knowledge gained through this system. I can feel it.
