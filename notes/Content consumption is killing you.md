I don't get why you keep devolving to it.
It's literally poison!
Don't worry about things out of your control.
Become a strong gatekeeper of the mind. Determine what thoughts you feed and which thoughts you simply let pass. Let go and allow the attention to settle where it needs to.
Improve Samadhi. Concentration. Do not cave. The penalty is a lot higher than it seems.

Remember the main goal - which you keep forgetting when you allow your mind to get sucked into the drama of the world. Bring the mind under your control. Master it.

Every second counts. Craft.

It's literally making time fly by faster. That's crazy!
I never thought of it like that. The 3 days sit felt like weeks! Yet, the one day out of feels like it was taken away from me.

I can control time. And the most important tool I have is to eliminate consumption. Amen.
