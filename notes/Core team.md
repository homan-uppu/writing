The core team will be responsible for designing, implementing and iterating on the Network. This will include people from a variety of backgrounds: design, engineering, legal.

The wallet associated with the Network token will act as the treasury for this team who can use the money in the wallet towards building the Network.

This team will remain as small as possible. In the early days, in order to make execution efficient, this core team will have authority on how it prioritizes its work. Over time, power will be more decentralized enabling every user to have a say in key decisions about how the Network functions, and which features to prioritize.
