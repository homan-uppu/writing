- i don't want to think of categories when i'm exploring. i just want to save. but i can only do this if there's an easy way to manage my clusters. the cluster management is a different intention entirely than during consumption.
- ideally: 
	- just add to a feed "to be clustered". and be able to take time out to cluster once in a while.
	- AI to automatically cluster according to my clusters (the name and descriptions of those clusters).
	- easily move items from one cluster to another (in case i rename / combine / etc.).

the lack of cluster management creates a mental friction.
