If you can do this for the first essay, the subsequent essays will take a fraction of the time required to achieve this standard. This investment is critical. Even if you take the rest of the year to just write this single fucking essay it doesn't matter. The skill is critical.

Quality is far more important than volume. Nail the quality first, and then increase the volume.

I honestly don't care if you take the rest of the year for this single essay. It doesn't fucking matter! The time investment is crucial because getting to the quality you want builds the muscle to achieve that quality whenever you want. And that is absolutely critical.

Build a great product first, and then think about scaling it: making more units, more quickly. But the ability to build a great product needs to come first. And the bar for what makes a product great (and a product can be anything) is accelerating upwards. So high that most people that create won't be able to reach it not because they don't have the potential, but because they don't know how to achieve that quality. It requires an entire lifestyle.

Allocate much more time than you think is necessary. It will take more time than expected. This is the nature of achieving world class quality. Amen.
