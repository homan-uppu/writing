What am I going to write about?

Keep the mind focused on what matters to you. Don't worry at all about "reception", "engagement", "audience", etc. Write what you would want to read. That's it.

OK, so what is it that I'm going to write about? Does it have to be a written essay? Can I instead write a video script? I'm hesitant to write a video script because I don't feel like that's the first step. But that's the point: the visual medium is fundamentally different than the written medium. Writing a video script is totally different from writing an essay.

There are no rules. If you feel like you want to write a video script, go right ahead! Nothing stopping you brother. But only start if you feel something you need to communicate through video.

I also feel like I'm unnecessarily tethered to writing about things in a certain style that doesn't suit me. For some reason it feels too mechanical. I ought to experiment with a different, more natural, style of writing.

I think more important than style is what you choose to write about.
