Lean into the creator economy. 

**The entire economy is about to become the creator economy. We are all becoming artists.** 

This is the connection Iâ€™ve been missing in my thinking so far. Lean into the creator economy. Build for the creator economy, and soon you'll realize you'd have built for the entire economy.

There is a new financial instrument to be adopted by the world. We will invest in individuals similar to how we invest in companies. We give promising creators capital to invest in their craft - well before they generate any revenue off of it, in exchange for equity in the value they create. Similar to how we do for companies, except one level of abstraction higher.

Any company this creator starts, any company they invest in, any revenue they generate through their work impacts the value of their "token".

Countries that offer universal basic income will give it in exchange for equity in the individual's token. This way, even if the individual moves and creates value in another country, the country that gave them the money to get started continues to reap the rewards.
