[[Opinionated AI (Seeking truth is the only skill)]]
[[Curated knowledge design exploration]]

---
### Problem
1. **Popular != quality.** Some of the most valuable knowledge is expressed by builders (who are actually shipping quality products) with only a few thousand (or tens of thousands) of followers on socials. Meanwhile the LinkedInfluencers / Youtubers who spout garbage have millions of followers.
2. **Free > Paid**. The best knowledge is free because the person sharing it has found much better ways to monetize their wisdom. In fact, if they're charging money for it, they're probably not as good as you think they are. (this is more of a feature rather than a "problem" per se - this feature enables me to work on this direction).

### Notes
A repository of useful knowledge suggested by vetted individuals who know their shit. Built for the next generation of builders / creators.

Ideally:
- It remains up-to-date over time.
- Incentivizes those who know their shit to contribute. Rewards them in ways they want to be rewarded.
- Strong curation. Everything is vetted. Only knowledge that I think is good stays on the platform. Opinionated. Not "every way is a good way", but "**there is a best way to do something, and we're going to seek it**".

Growth:
1. Beautifully, intuitively presented.
2. Experiment with better ways to deliver relevant information when the user wants it / needs it.

THE link to share when a builder asks: "what are some good resources to learn __ ?".
That would be the goal. It needs to be so damn good that anyone worth their salt would instinctively lean towards sharing this link with anyone that asks them this question.

This would be a 6 month project at the least. It would take at least a month to design it well (to think through all the possible ways in which valuable knowledge can be presented to someone looking to learn).

And this would be the first step towards an "opinionated AI". A ground truth for all the useful stuff out there. To not get distracted by shit that doesn't matter. And to present it in the best possible way. These are worthwhile goals to strive for.

All sorts of content: videos, books, essays, tweets, casts, whatever it is. Organize it. Present it in the best possible way.

There's a positive community angle to this as well: there is a powerful intention and cause here that will pull support from all corners of the community. That would be incredibly valuable.

If I were you, I would really commit to this. I would double down and execute it without worrying too much about 

The essay to kickstart this would be [[Opinionated AI (Seeking truth is the only skill)]]. Put down all your thinking there about the kinds of systems that would be incredibly useful to help us learn what we need to in order to thrive. - the philosophy behind it all. Then start the design process of exploring what it means to organize information like this and how to present it in the best way possible. Amen.

If I were to think about how to approach this. Start with what I would want to see. *Start visually, that's totally fine*. Imagine what you would want to see and why. The narrower the domain, the better off it would be imo. Should I start with something like "design"? Or should I start with something as broad as "building product"?

What does building entail?
- Design
- Engineering
- Sales
- Strategy
- Marketing
- Finance

There's also the angle of: you no longer have to stay up-to-date with socials every single day. You can rely on a platform like this (once you trust that it captures the most essential stuff), to show you what's been added over the time period that you were away.

There is a challenge of scale, but not really because the power law is massive. But nvm, there is a massive challenge of scale bec. even if the power law is massive, we need to see ALL of what is created to find the nuggets. It's going to be a brutal effort, but one that's going to be incredibly worthwhile. The world needs this, and it will teach us what it means to create an opinionated AI. Absolutely.

Don't worry about monetization just yet. Just focus on creating what the world needs. Because the intention is pure, there should be sufficient support right out of the gate. Take advantage of peoples' desire to "do good" in the world. There ought to be a solid monetization angle here, but will explore that later. First create. Do the hard work and create the MVP for a narrow angle, with sufficient enough content.

If you execute this well, this is your ticket back to the promised land. This is how you're going to get back. The path is clear. It's an execution game. The problem is crystal clear in my mind. I've felt it so damn often. There really hasn't been a good enough solution. Damn.

This is it. Do things that don't scale and get this off the ground.

The best place to figure out how to learn something. Only content from the best, who are vetted. **A few standard deviations better than the average content feed on the internet.**

**There are many ways to structure this**. Need to choose the better ones.

There's also an angle of "highlights": only showing the best, most important parts of a piece of content. Not everything - even from the best - is valuable. Time is of the essence.

"Text transcriptions of video" - to enable faster consumption. Audio (to listen on the go).

This is a worthwhile endeavor. I can feel it. And perhaps you're in the right place as well - you can find cheap labor here to help build the initial set of data and "codify intuition" in such a way that as LLMs become more powerful, they can start to take over more of the work.

"Codify intuition" - I really like this phrase. It makes a lot of sense. That is essentially what we're trying to do. Amen.

Do NOT worry about n=2 curators and what that would look like. It does not fucking matter right now. Imagine you are the only curator. Do not worry about curator incentives. Just give me the best fucking knowledge base for the next generation of builders. That's all you have to fucking do. Amen.

Put yourself in the shoes of a 17 year old looking to learn how to build something for the world. There are many pieces of knowledge that would be invaluable for them. Give that to them. **That's all you fucking have to do.**

Seriously. How deep you go is up to you. But you should certainly be able to get to a point of momentum. Can see from there what the right moves are, but get there first!

*Next steps:*
1. **Design**: imagine exactly what you would want from such a platform and why. That's it. Paper and pen - go through many iterations. Find the angles that are most promising. Invest the time you need in the design. Remember: the right one will be orders of magnitude better than the average. Fucking find it.
