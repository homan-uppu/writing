No one here seems to be serious about studying the Truth.
How much of a problem is this? But, I don't seem to have any choice in the matter.
You shouldn't let this affect you in any way. This is part of the practice. Just keep to yourself and study the Truth. That's all you have to do.

You don't need "serious practitioners" around you. You can be your own company. Just stop engaging with those around you beyond the practical conversations (e.g. offer help around the house, etc.). You should not get involved beyond that.

When you're disappointed in the people around you, and especially if you let them impact your practice, you're not walking the path. When you're disappointed with the situation, you develop a craving to leave. When you develop a craving to leave, what you do changes because you more aggressively optimize for money, when you optimize for money, it takes you off the path of pure creation and delays everything in the long run.
