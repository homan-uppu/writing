You need to work super hard to curb this. To bring your body and brain under your control.
Wow. Absolutely terrible feeling I tell you. Must get this under control asap.

Get the diet under control as well. The same food. The same quantity. Every single day. At the same time. Get on this program from tomorrow onwards as well.

And it's time to get an office space outside of home. This isn't cutting it.

Wow. I have never felt this "out of it". This is ridiculous. Must get on the right diet. Must stick to it. Amen. There is turmoil within. Must approach the problem at its root.
