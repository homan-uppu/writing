It's time to really deepen the practice.

I still don't feel comfortable committing to it fully. That doesn't feel like the right path right now. But, I'm going to ramp it up tremendously. That's the plan.

What are the ways in which I can do this?
1. Rent out a *meditation room* + office. (1 / 2 bhk out of which the meditation room is on its own).
2. Find an *abandoned building* / garden / something and just go there and sit.
3. Sit at the *temple* (near the railway crossing). - but the bathroom & water will be an issue. You can bring water in the car. The bathroom can be had by going on a short walk and just going.
4. Move to Uttarkashi, wear robes for a year. Get really serious. Follow the scriptures. Allocate some time every day to grinding materially. (but then you're not living up to the purpose of the robes). If you take up the robes (temporarily), for that period at least, the practice must be your top priority. Amen.
