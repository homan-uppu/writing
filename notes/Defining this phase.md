I have no option but to create until there is momentum. That is all there is to do.

I can’t define momentum. Any way I define it optimizes for the wrong thing. E.g.:
- Number of posts optimizes for quantity over quality.
- Number of words has the same problem.
- External validation creates a craving for status that pollutes what you create.

There can be no metric. The metric is purely a “feeling”. The moment you reduce it into something that is measurable, you start to game it. And gaming any metric is the path to mediocrity.

Momentum is a feeling. What is that feeling?
- Understanding
- Clarity.
- Meaningful conversations
- Meaningful new relationships stemming from the meaningful conversations.

Actually, this is good. The meaningful conversations and relationships formed is a good metric. That's when you know that there's something special happening. Amen.

Just keep writing. That's all you can do.
