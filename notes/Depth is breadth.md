*This is a great title. This is something that I believe deeply in. And I ought to flesh it out.*

I believe the most important skill is the ability to achieve a deep level of understanding about something.
 
Deep understanding is intuitive. Intuition is a feeling. A feeling for the possibilities. A feeling about what works and what doesn't. A feeling for how to prioritize.

While the rational mind is required to act on the intuition, it's the intuition that separates those that understand their craft well and those that don't.

It is a generalizable skill. The person who has the ability to explore something deeply in one domain is able to apply that to any domain they want because the underlying muscle to go deep is the exact same. 

A great basketball player is closer to becoming a great musician than a mediocre musician.
A great scientist is closer to becoming a great filmmaker than a mediocre filmmaker.

Understanding something deeply requires a level of mastery over yourself to withstand the agitation that comes from the various challenges you'll inevitably face on the journey. You'll be forced to understand the realities of yourself - the human condition - in order to deeply understand anything outside of you. 

After all how can you explore the universe well without cultivating an understanding the primary tool you use to perceive anything: your mind.

Going all in is also the best way to figure out whether a particular path is the right one because it reduces the time it takes to know if it's right or not. Surface level explorations don't give you the insight you require to make a decision on whether that's the right path for you.
