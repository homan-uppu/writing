Damn, tomorrow I really need to do one meal only. This is getting out of hand. Seriously.

I'm disappointed in myself for not being able to stick to this diet. I'm fine without caffeine, but cutting food has been the toughest thing to let go of.

I have such a strong addiction to food. That's simply sad. Fuck.

Abstinence is important brother. You must find a way to do this. Your life depends on it. Absolutely. 

I feel so full and lethargic. Yet hungry at the same time, as if I haven't gotten my nutrients for the day. Sigh... the worst of both worlds.
