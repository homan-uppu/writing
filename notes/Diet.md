It all comes down to the diet. This is the differentiating factor. Abundantly clear. The carbs, sugars, etc. are killing me. And I definitely believe it's the carbs not the caffeine (bec. of the whole milk matcha experiment)... So yeah, back to the tried and tested game plan. Amen.

Or, it could be the caffeine - that is the biggest change I made for the days leading up to the window. Fascinating. Perhaps try to do that again?

And then of course OMAD.

Yeah, the entire diet fell of course with the experiments to show me that yes, this is definitely a multi-fold problem, not just pelvic floor as I had previously thought. Great, get back on the plan. Amen.

The diet is critical. I would bet that OMAD is more important than keto, but the combination is super effective.

Another learning: you can't OMAD in the afternoon if you're working out in the evening. That doesn't work since you're going to be starving post work out. That's just common sense.

Also: slowly start to minimize the milks you use for the Matcha when you start the sesh. I believe that sugar content is killing you. Damn.

That's it. Tomorrow onwards, OMAD time. Amen. And you have Ashtanga.
