I'm finding it difficult to write about these concepts (e.g. free markets, etc.). this is because i don't understand them as well as i thought i did. that is where the difficulty stems from.

therefore, this process of writing it out is a way of clarifying these concepts for myself - an incredibly valuable outcome.

lean into the difficulty so that you can come out the other side with much greater clarity about how the world actually works, with a clear explanation for why that's the case.

Difficulty in writing is a great sign that you're learning something. It's a positive signal.

And it's OK if the output feels like crap! That's the first step.
