At many points of this phase, you're going to feel incredibly uncomfortable. But, at the very least, you will have no room for excuses. If you can't get what you want it will be entirely your fault. You will have no one else to blame for not getting what you want than your own lack of strength.

Will you last? Or will you perish like the countless others that have tried to do something meaningful? I'm not sure. Let's find out :).

The suffering is real. Whether you have 1000 people around you, or whether you're by yourself. Suffering manifests whether you like it or not, whenever it wants - outside of your direct control. All you can do is organize your environment (body, mind) in a way that Suffering doesn't like. There are environments in which even if Suffering arrives, it does so as a guest just dropping by on a walk to the park, rather than a parasitic guest that never leaves after they arrive.
