As things start to click in my mind, I begin to feel this impatience: this desire to implement it as quickly as I possibly can. My mind becomes more rushed and anxious. And in that anxiety, my judgement suffers.

I must train my ability to remain incredibly calm no matter the situation: in both failure and success. A calm mind sees clearly. And that clarity is invaluable. Especially as the power law becomes stronger because only the best execution will succeed.

With this direction, you have time. If you lay the foundation well, you will set yourself up to execute well for the foreseeable future. But, the foundation must be exceptionally strong.

And yeah, laying this foundation is going to take weeks. Of course, I'm going to go as fast as I can, but I can't afford to sacrifice the balance of the mind. My calmness must not shake much, else judgement suffers and everything crashes.

1. **Lay the foundation** through writing and deep thinking.
2. **Build an exceptional team.**
3. **Gather support** from the best of the best. Raise fuel to tackle a long-term problem.
4. **Execute relentlessly.**

That's what the path looks like.
The foundation is the most important. Take the time to get this right.
And, the foundation is entirely writing. That's how you think things through well.
There's really no other way.

You have the time to be calm. This is why you have to take a very long-term approach. It eases the mind. Yet, simultaneously, each week must be incredibly productive. But, first lay the foundation. And take all the time you want / need in order to do so. Any writing and exploration will not be wasted effort. Believe in yourself.
