You're making the fundamental mistake of categorizing your exploration. That poisons your exploration. It creates a narrative that you have to "play inside of".

Think back to when you were a child. Did you care about the *label* of what you were doing? Absolutely not. You just did it for the sake of doing it. There was something intrinsic that pulled you in that direction and you just went and did it.

The problem with getting older is that your subconscious gets more complex, polluted. It tries to figure out what to do in order to get status. And that's almost always limiting.

You need to find the child-like play, curiosity, wonder that you can just follow. It doesn't come from analytically approaching everything trying to "think" your want to some kind of solution. The direction needs to be felt. And if you can't feel it in the moment, give it some time and space to manifest itself. There's no need to hurry.

But even as a child you were seeking status. You just sucked at identifying it. I mean, you still suck, but you are a bit more aware of it.

True freedom of the mind is gained by overcoming craving. The degree to which you crave is the degree of your enslavement.

It's time to start the next essay. There really is no need to overthink this. You have a writing plan. Just stick to it.
