I know that you have this feeling that essays "don't cut it", and that you have to make videos in order to stand out or some other shit.

You're severely underestimating the power and reach of the written word.

Many of the smartest, busiest people still consume predominantly through the written word. It's incredibly powerful, especially for the most powerful.

Yes, eventually video is the ultimate medium for reach. Once you've sufficiently established what you're going to do, your thinking & philosophy. But, even when you do, having the writing foundation will be an invaluable asset. You can literally mold writing to channel into other mediums in the same way great filmmakers build screenplays from books.

Write without worrying about "reach".
Write to think.
Write to understand.
Write to share.
Write to get feedback on your thinking.
Write.

Don't stop writing. Even when you move to the visual medium, the initial step will always be to write. Don't forget that.

This is also why it's so important to make your website an excellent representation of what essays can be in the age of video. Make them powerful. Flex your taste. Tell great stories.
