What are your strengths?

1. Being aware of what I'm feeling and making sense of it.
2. Exploring, updating, and communicating my feelings through writing (for now).

This is it. Master these strengths. Do nothing outside of these strengths. And surround yourself with folks who complement these skills. I will not "engineer" from now on unless it's a very temporary exploration.

Completely double down on this. Think of nothing else during this phase.
