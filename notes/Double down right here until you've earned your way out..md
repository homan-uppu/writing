Remember the feeling after you stopped your self-course mid-way? You felt that you should have seen it through because your world did not improve by stopping mid way.

That is exactly how you will feel if you leave Hyderabad without seeing this phase through. I understand, it's painful to still be here. It's painful to have absolutely nothing. And it's painful to watch your own mind descend into despair.

But, the fact is that no matter where you go, you will feel the same exact despair that you feel here. You cannot escape it by moving. How long will you run? How far will you go? You cannot escape your own mind.

You know this deep down. That's why you're unable to move with the conviction that you're used to. The move back to India was swift. The move from India to the US in 2023 was swift. There was no doubt in your mind. The move was swift.

This time around you're hesitating. You lack the conviction that a move would be beneficial because you know the truth: that it isn't. You can no longer run away. It's time to pull up your socks, embrace the grind, and play the long game.
