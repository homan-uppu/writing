Artificial intelligence is rapidly making our work more creative by doing the grunt work for us. This shift breaks down our current education system because it directly challenges its core business model: charging money up front in exchange for an education and credential.

Charging money in exchange for education works when students have a reliable path to employment so that they can earn back their investment. But, as the creativity of our work increases, that reliability goes out the window **independent of the quality of the education program**. The fundamental nature of highly creative work doesn't allow for reliably becoming good enough as I'll discuss below.

Not only does reliability in getting good enough go out the window, but the outcomes for creative work follows the power law distribution: most results will increasingly be captured by a small set of top performers. This reduces the room for average performers to contribute because AI makes the best much, much better than the average in ways that we haven't seen before.

The only business model that works for training highly creative skills that have a power law distribution of outcomes is venture capital: giving individuals capital to fund their learning, in exchange for equity in their outcomes.

Future engineers, designers, analysts, creators, or anybody for that matter, will have to think like startup founders and raise money to fund their learning.

## No scalable & reliable way to become good at highly creative skills.

First, let me define what I mean by creativity: the more creative a task is, the more ways there are to do it. From a game theory standpoint, creativity is proportional to the number of actions you can take, and the number of possible states you can end up in. (This is called "complexity" - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_complexity - of the game, i.e. creativity is proportional to complexity).

A worker on a factory line only has so many ways in which they can assemble something. It's not that creative. A content creator has nearly endless possibilities for the video they make. Highly creative.

Early knowledge work was also not that creative. Many in your parents / grandparents generation will remember how in the 80's you could spend a few months to learn how to type and get employed as a typist or as a data entry clerk and make around $70k (in 2024 dollars)! 

As technology does the easy jobs for us, our training becomes longer and harder in order to get good enough to create value in the world. 

But when our work reaches a certain level of creativity, longer and harder training might not cut it because the reliability no longer exists.

For example, we haven't found a reliable way to train content creators, musicians, authors, entrepreneurs, etc. Most of them fail!

There are countless stories of creatives whose children who chose to follow in their parent's footsteps that end up failing to create any value, even though they had the best resources and mentorship possible.

Even if Mr. Beast started a college to train Youtube Creators, the majority of graduates will still struggle to make ends meet relying entirely on the income generated through making content. And even for the ones that make it, it's not clear, or predictable, how long it would take them. Some creators may take off right away, while others may have to endure a slow grind for years before seeing significant revenue, and most may give up before they get there.

Ycombinator is the world's most successful startup accelerator that funds and mentors startup founders. Yet, most of their startups fail.

Even if it were possible to design the perfect education system for highly creative fields such that most could make a living through a creative craft, we haven't found it yet, and I don't think we'll find it anytime soon for reasons I'll dive into in another post. But the lack of any evidence in the world today should suffice for us to acknowledge how implausible it is to reliably train someone to be good enough to make a living in a highly creative field.

And when the guarantee of getting a job if you do well in college goes out the window, then then the standard education business model of taking money to teach becomes invalid.

(note: I want to be clear, from an individual perspective, I definitely believe it's possible to become great at any creative skill. At the individual level, you are not a lottery ticket: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZM_JmZdqCw. At scale, it's not possible to reliably train. For example: for Bill Gates with this upbringing, barring any freak accident / illness, had a very reliable way of becoming world class because he was built that way + exposed to the right things in that way. My claims are for when we look at the entire population together. Similar for Mr. Beast, etc.).

## All knowledge work will become highly creative

"Wait!" you say. Of course you can't reliably train for highly creative skills. That's why no sane person from a not-so-rich family majors in art. And that's why going to a school for "business" doesn't change your chances of building a great business. This has been obvious for a while. But, what happens when all knowledge work rapidly evolves to become like the arts or business? This is what I see happening.

Let's look at a specific example: the software engineer. I'm choosing this because computer science is the fastest growing major, and most people studying computer science do so in order to become software engineers (as of today), so it's a good starting point for analysis. And I believe the lessons we learn studying software engineers will apply to other knowledge work.

In the mid 2010's, I would say that you could reliably train software engineers to be good enough to land great jobs in the world. While the best engineers were incredibly creative, and competent, and oftentimes an order of magnitude better than the average, there was still a lot of room for the average to contribute and grow within companies.

The average had room because someone still had to do the low creativity work of implementing things. And anyone who has ever written software pre AI knows just how much grunt work goes into translating a great idea on paper into an actual working breathing application.

But what happens when that grunt work is done by AI? Then, an engineer would focus on higher level decision making: architecture, system design, and perhaps product decisions. And they'd only drop into lower levels of abstractions when AI fails.

What happens when AI can translate a spec and design references into features reliably? What happens when a software engineer can command and instruct an intelligent, instantaneous, always available teammates to do most of the engineering well? They'd start focusing more on product, and business decisions.

The engineer is now forced to act like a CEO: obsessing over what products / business lines to build, how to serve customers best, and diving deep into the code when the AI fails. In fact, many of the best software engineers at the fastest growing startups already operate in this way.

But wait, we ended up at a role that looks awfully similar to an entrepreneur! Highly creative. Can most engineers reliably level up to becoming a great entrepreneur within their companies? I don't think so because I mentioned above, we haven't found a reliable way of training that skill so that everyone becomes good enough on a reasonable time frame.
## Power law distribution of outcomes

There's another phenomena that manifests as technology (AI) becomes more powerful: the best become much better than the average.

To continue the example above, let's say we have GPT-5 and now every engineer at a startup is being challenged to make more architectural, product and business decisions. The differences between those that are great and the rest will be stark. Much starker than the differences when they were doing less creative work.

The degree of power law distribution of outcomes is proportional to how creative the work is.

(visual comparing of power law between different roles).

What happens when the great engineers are now 10000x more competent than the average. They have better product sense, better business judgement, better taste, better communication style, and will generate orders of magnitude greater results than the average.

Would a company hold onto the average to try and train them for a skill they know is super difficult to train (that hasn't been reliably done before), or would they want to look for other great engineers to hire and fire the average ones? I don't think there's a choice here.

Mind you, this is a very different decision than if the best were only 5x / 10x better than the average and there was work for the average to do, and the average could be more reliably trained to become good enough.

GPT-4 / Claude 3.5 Sonnet itself has drastically leveraged great engineers. I would estimate that those engineers who were 10x more impactful than the average are now 100 if not 1000x more impactful. You'd believe me if you saw just how much AI has transformed some of these folks' workflows.

When each person can command a reasonably intelligent army of agents to do work, this gap will widen.

This gap between the best and the rest of the companies will widen as well. This trend has been ongoing for a while:

"Especially in software, many situations have winner-take-all dynamics due to network effects and switching costs. Being the winner means being in the 99.99-percentile. A winner at the top takes nearly everything, and only a pittance goes to the others â€” so being 99.99-percentile is worth an order of magnitude or two more than being just 98-percentile." (Peter Thiel / Joe Lonsdale - https://www.8vc.com/resources/lessons-from-peter-thiel).

But, it's about to be amplified even more. As more outcomes go into the hands of the best companies, no company that wants to win can risk hiring average because there's no longer a reliable way of making them great, as the skill itself is too creative now.

This is why there are countless new grad engineers searching for jobs that sadly won't get them, while there is simultaneously insane demand for great software engineers with never-before-seen sky high compensations. This is why companies are laying off in droves, while still hiring. This is why you'll be hard pressed to find new grad roles listed in many of the fastest growing technology companies now.

It feels paradoxical until you see that just in the past 2-3 years the power law for software engineers has become much sharper. The best are wayyy better than the average and the market is slowly starting to feel it. There is increasingly less room for the average.

In a sense, software engineering is the canary in the coal mine because it's the quickest to adopt new technologies, and one of the least regulated fields, and therefore the market is quickest to reflect the truth. I'd bet soon we'll see the same trend in other knowledge work domains (note: barring those that are super regulated like medicine, law, or ones that requires manipulating the physical world because we have to wait for robots).

## Venture capital to fund learning

As our work becomes more creative, people will no longer be able to pay money up front in exchange for education.

Only one business model works: venture capital. Putting money in the hands of bright young people with potential - to enable them to learn by doing, while taking equity in their outcomes. The few who strike big will compensate for the many that may take much longer to create value (or may never).

Why aren't we seeing this happen yet?

Firstly, I acknowledge that it may be happening, and I just haven't seen it yet due to my ignorance. But from what I can tell, there are a few big blockers.
1. Lack of the right financial instrument.
2. Cultural momentum. - (an important point here is that people will stick to the default which is college, even though at this point going through college is just as, if not more, risky than not going!)

## More thoughts, not sure where (or if) they fit in.

-> 

There are a few pieces of evidence that support this narrative. The first is observing bootcamps and ..., and the second is analyzing the software engineering job market today.

(cursor_ai team yt video link). In the near future with more advanced AI and the right programming frameworks to take advantage of the AI, I would bet that a small, cracked team like this can outperform a million software engineers from large Tech / consulting companies.

That's the future that I see.

On the one hand it's incredibly beautiful to see so much incredible talent rise. I feel grateful that we've come this far as society to enable such minds. At the same time we need to be very cautious of the consequences for those who aren't naturally inclined towards their crafts - as more people aren't. (this can come later - probably towards the end - i.e. the conclusion is where you can express your gratitude, etc.)

More evidence?
1. Bootcamps analysis.
2. Write of passage, etc.

Maybe this can go in some sort of appendix section. Hmm...
