Inequality in ability is a function of complexity. In games, complexity corresponds to the number of possibilities within the game. A simpler game has fewer possibilities, while a more complex game has many more possibilities. The greater the complexity of the game, the greater the inequality in ability, no matter how hard the players train.

Let's look at three popular board games: [Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) (simple), [Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess) (medium complexity), [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) (high complexity).

Tic Tac Toe is simpler than Chess because there are less possibilities (less possible board positions), and similarly Chess is simpler than Go.

As complexity of the game increases, the difference in ability between the best and the rest increases, no matter how much training the players have. We can observe this in the ELO ratings of professionals for these games. "ELO rating" is a way to calculate relative skills of players:

> The difference in the ratings between two players serves as a predictor of the outcome of a match. Two players with equal ratings who play against each other are expected to score an equal number of wins. A player whose rating is 100 points greater than their opponent's is expected to score 64%; if the difference is 200 points, then the expected score for the stronger player is 76%. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system))

Difference in ELO rating doesn't translate linearly to the difference in wins. Someone who is a few hundred ELO rating higher than another will almost certainly win.

In Go, the difference in ELO rating of the top two players is 183 ([https://www.goratings.org/en/](https://www.goratings.org/en/)), whereas in Chess, the difference in ELO rating of the top two Chess players is only 25 ([https://www.chess.com/players](https://www.chess.com/players)).

The gap between the best and the next best is greater in Go than in Chess. Meanwhile there's no need for ELO rating for Tic Tac Toe because every "professional" would draw: everyone's ELO is 0.

Inequality is not linear. The gap between the best player and the 2nd best player is larger than the gap between the 2nd best player and the 3rd best, and so on. The greater the complexity of the game, the greater the gap between the best and the rest, and the more skewed the curve looks.

***The more complex the game, the more equal players are in ability, the further they are from the best.***

Inequality in ability is independent how much training the players have. The players we've referenced above have dedicated their entire lives to becoming great at their game, and yet we see inequality because training for complex games leads to greater variance in ability - by nature. (I suspect this is because the most complex the game, the more we rely on intuition)
