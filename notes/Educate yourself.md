*Path to greatness:*
- Be more ambitious (Ambition is required more than ever)
- Fear similarity (to the degree of leverage, for the things that matter)
- Think more before you do
- Paying for education doesn't work.
- Study yourself
- Go all in.
- What we actually want
- Obsession
- Don't label yourself.
- High integrity.
- Build compassion.

*Each skill has the following components*
1. What it is.
2. What is optimal today (for today's leverage).
3. How will the optimal change. (i.e. how to update when leverage changes).
4. How to be more optimal. (What to implement to actually improve).

These may also be collapsed together in ways that I can't see right now. I don't think it will result in 14 essays as it looks right now.

*Other truths about the world that may be required to explain how to be great.*

- Changing yourself is more difficult than you think. ("Why I won't work with old people" - probably a better title).
- The anxious generation? There is a book about this. It would be interesting to explore this. If it's true and there is a fundamental shift in anxiety.
