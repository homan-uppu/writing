Based on what the economy wants, the right education is one that:
1. Helps an individual discover their unique talents as fast as possible.
2. Helps them become one of the best in the world at what they do.

Both of these goals are fundamentally different than what education is designed to do today: produce many average, similar, performers. Education as we know it today was a product of the industrial and information ages when there was ample room for the average employee: doing undifferentiated work at an average level.

Of course, all schools and colleges (especially the best ones) have always marketed themselves as producers of the next generation of original leaders who will run the world. But the reality is that the vast majority of their graduates are undifferentiated cogs in large machines that operate in finance, consulting and Tech. Even worse: the majority of schools and colleges only produce such cogs **at best**. Such institutes will be completely irrelevant in a post-AI world because undifferentiated cogs will create no value in a post-AI world.

The optimal education for a post-AI world looks very different than what we are used to. To help an individual discover their unique talents.
