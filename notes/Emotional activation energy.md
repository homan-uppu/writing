Why centralization snips many inventions in the bud.
Talk about pre 1993 India. Soviet Union. Many parts of the developing world in which central authorities seem to dictate what people can work on.

What I don't hear talked about often is the emotional activation energy required to start a project. It's not just capital, a team, etc. that's important. It's the feeling that what you're going to build can't be captured, or killed by some other individual with more power than you through unfair means.

This is where I see tremendous power for programmatically decentralized platforms (web3). The point is that they will enable a sort of experimentation that is at least an order of magnitude greater than the experimentation that non-decentralized platforms enable because the emotional activation energy will be met for an order of magnitude more people because no one can kill your baby unfairly.

The crux is about fairness. When a system lacks fairness, our blood boils. Especially a creator's blood.

OK, this extends beyond just developers. Even content creators - what are they willing to create knowing that they can't be demonetized or de-platformed out of nowhere.

Copyright laws will need to be updated. If you cannot stop someone from copying and publishing another person's work, and it's far more expensive to go after them, a lot more copyrighted content will fly right through. While this sounds like a problem, I think rethinking copyright laws is an important, positive step for the world. (and this is a separate essay entirely that I can get into later).
