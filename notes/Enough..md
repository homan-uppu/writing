This is now the highest priority.
Nothing is more important than this.
I'm going to overcome everything.

Drastic outcomes call for drastic measures.
Brainstorming some options:

Absolutely required: far more meditation.

If you can't conquer the mind, your life is a waste.
Don't wither your life away.
The greatest victory isn't "creating value" in the external world.
It's to master your own mind.
There is nothing more worthwhile to be done.
My problems are entirely within myself.
It's time to attack them.

But you can't take drastic steps without first preparing the mind to do so.
You can't move until you have a 90 day streak.
Or you can move and develop this there? I'm not sure how to think of this.

One thing is certain. Take the time off, but spend it wisely. There is no need to rush into the next thing out of a fear of missing out or falling behind. Be patient. If you have the right mind, everything else will take care of itself.

Whatever comes from a polluted mind is polluted.
Your mind is quite polluted.
Damn.
