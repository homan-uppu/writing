This also means that i'm going to create the website for this draft itself. amen.

What kind of feedback is most valuable? I would say the kind that attacks the core points on which the essay is based on. NOT the nitpick feedback / the line-by-line feedback, etc.

therefore, there's no need to allow readers to annotate. just need to give them an open text box at the end of the essay. that's all that's required. amen.

What kind of feedback am I even looking for? From whom? Is feedback via annotation even necessary? Or, will the most valuable feedback be big picture criticisms and questions that don't require annotating?

Who will I solicit feedback from at the start? Need to answer these questions before I can decide what the next steps are.

thoughts:
- Letting everyone see each others' comments does NOT work because there is a power law to the quality of comments: most will absolutely suck. An independent thinker when confronted with many comments that suck will not want to participate in that discourse. 
- And the mediocre comments are honestly quite distracting.

so yes, collecting feedback from each individual is important. that's what i want to optimize for.

Options:
- Can keep in Google doc and just share that for feedback. Cpaik style.
	- Should probably do this for the very first draft - the one I send to someone who is "forced" to give me comprehensive feedback.
- Create a static site and present the essay beautifully. Solicit feedback that folks can give me via DM / email.
- Create an app that allows readers to annotate aspects of the essay and submit their "review" and provide their handle / email along with it so that i can reach out to them.

Letting everyone leave feedback on the same doc such that each person can see everyone else's feedback? Need to think this through. This is what will decide the path to take.
