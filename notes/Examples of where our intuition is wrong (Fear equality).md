To illustrate how our intuitions fail us, let's study a young person (Joe) in today's world looking to build a great life. I'm making a few assumptions about this young person that I believe represent(s/ed) most of us:
1. They want what they do to be valued by the world.
2. They're not yet sure what they're great at that the world also values (and will continue to value once they become great at it).
3. They have desires for things to buy: a home, a car, and a few other things and at least live the quality of life their parents likely did. They want to make good money.

Each blunder is costlier than ever as it compounds more quickly than ever before. The following are failure modes for this young person that will cause them to fail far worse than a similarly skilled young person from just a few years ago. For the sake of time, I'm only sharing 4 blunders out of the many, many blunders they will make.

***1st blunder: what to learn***

Joe will be lured into learning less complex skills that will be quickly outdated as leverage rapidly increases the complexity of the games we play. Instead of building their intuition for how to make people feel, Joe will learn skills that are more disconnected than solving for feeling.

He will spend his efforts learning programming frameworks, design tools, etc. without spending adequate time studying the human condition: what makes people feel, how to create things that make people feel good (which includes how to remove their pain).

***2nd blunder: how to learn***

Joe's second blunder will be in how he goes about learning what he thinks is useful.

He will be lured in by colleges, bootcamps, etc. that claim that a high percentage of graduates get great job offers upon graduating. They claim "average $100k salary!". Basing an learning path decision off of the average salary is a massive blunder because what matters much more than the average is the distribution of outcomes, and what the highest outcome is. 

If this learning program does not have massive outliers, it is an outdated learning program given the leverage that exists in the world today because it means that they are teaching skills that are not complex enough, and therefore will not matter as leverage increases.

The ideal learning program in today's world that will best prepare a student for the future will have extremely asymmetric outcomes in ability. Of course, there is a gap between ability and outcome. Even though the best software engineer who can correctly leverage AI is likely 50x more productive than the average today, they will not get paid that much more. But, as the world becomes more fair and people are compensated more accurately, assessing the magnitude of the greatest outcome will become more accurate.

In addition to joining the wrong institution, Joe will likely take out loans or spend hard earned money to join such institutions. Paying money for education works in a more symmetrical outcomes world. Today, if the education is optimal, it means the outcomes will be quite asymmetrical, and therefore it's highly likely Joe will not get the return on his investment. Pay-to-learn is an outdated education business model in an asymmetric world.

***3rd blunder: choice in team***

Joe will be lured by teams that claim that everyone on the team is great. Given the leverage that exists in the world today, the best team will be far from having equally good members. If they're equally good it means they haven't upgraded their activities to be more complex, or they haven't upgraded their skills to optimally make use of the greater leverage, or they're deluded and aren't good at assessing true productivity.

Of course even the best teams will tell the world that everyone on the team is great. Joe will blunder by not spending time to seek the truth of the matter before they choose.

There is one exception for when an equally excellent team exists: when each person is doing a different, but similarly complex, activity. For example: a startup with an engineer, designer, and product / sales person. But even in this scenario it's not that they have equal outcomes, it's just more difficult to measure and compare how each is performing relative to the other. You can't find this exception in larger teams because we don't yet have sufficient leverage in the world to have, say, a single engineer running everything. Therefore as soon as you have a team of the same skill, you should certainly notice asymmetry in outcomes if they're a great team.

***4th blunder: delusional expectations***

Joe was born into an extremely deluded world. Truths about how the world works have become lies as the world changed.

Joe grows up believing there is a middle class waiting for him when he gets older.

Once Joe understands that a middle class doesn't exist as he wished, he will believe that he will gain access to some sort of universal basic income / welfare that will satisfy his basic needs.

Once Joe realizes that his wants in life will never be fulfilled by any universal basic income or welfare, he will believe that the only solution is to reverse this rapid rise in asymmetry. 

Joe won't realize that this is not possible without reversing the fundamental nature of all of our minds: we want things, and we crave to get them as quickly as possible - which underpins the incentives that govern our world.

Joe will not realize that any efforts to overthrow this system will only reinforce it, and therefore will spend precious time on efforts that go against the incentives of our world. Joe will be extremely unhappy as he will likely not succeed in the revolution he craves (unless he somehow manages to destroy all of humanity and everything we've created). He will also not have the skill to create value in the world, and will not be satisfied with the universal basic income offered to him. Joe will likely sadly turn towards addictions that he believes will help him cope.

Joe will be frustrated that he world has shifted from rewarding ambition to requiring ambition to get what you want. He will want to leave the rat race behind and leave the world to live peacefully in some remote area. Joe will then face a harsh reality that the ambition required to create value in the world will look far less than the ambition required to leave everything behind. He will realize just how addicted he is to all of the comforts of the modern world.

We must not become Joe.

There has never been a better time in human history to get what you want, including happiness. The world is increasingly become fair, and individuals have more knowledge and power at their fingertips than ever before. Yet, the path has become more narrow. We all need to up our game.
