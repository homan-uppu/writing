The real world is not like a board game. Life's not fair. Yet, fairness doesn't reduce inequality, it actually increases it.

Fairness means more accurately mapping ability to outcomes. In a fair world, someone who is more able than another will have better outcomes proportional to the difference in ability.

As leverage increases, we make more choices because it takes less time to implement ideas. Therefore, in a highly leveraged world, slight difference in ability leads to massive difference in outcomes because each choice compounds heavily. A person today lives many more lifetimes relative to a person from a century ago because we explore life more rapidly.

Not all explorations are equally valuable to the world. Someone who spends their entire life learning how to craft the best baskets to sell to their village will not have the same outcomes as someone who explored building software products for large audiences <FootnoteReference number={4} />.

Therefore we will find great inequality in a fair, leveraged world in which everyone does their best.

We haven't even taken into account the difference in our abilities at birth. It's silly to think that we're not born with different capabilities, different strengths and weaknesses, different emotional reactions to the same stimuli. The more complex a system, the more difficult it is to find two things that are equal: in Go, there are fewer equal board positions (in which both players have equal chance of winning) than in Chess or Tic Tac Toe. Nature is an incredibly complex system in which finding two things that are equal is almost impossible. No two trees are the same, no two rocks are the same. People are not created equal.

Unfairness can also cause inequality. But the shape of outcomes in an unfair world looks like a step function, whereas the shape of outcomes in a fair world looks like a smooth [power law curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law).

Unfair systems that tell you what you can and cannot do with your life, that have rigid class boundaries, that give some less rights than others are unfair and lead to outcomes that look like a step function: there aren't any individuals with outcomes in between the outcomes of the classes. In a more unfair world, all factory workers had equal outcomes, whereas all factory owners would have similar outcomes, but you'd find very few outcomes in between the workers and the owners.

Fair systems, such as a group of professional Chess players, will have unequal outcomes that look like a smooth [power law curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law). The curve is more extreme the more complex the game is, how quickly they make moves, and how long the game lasts.

Complete equality is possible in a fair world, but only when the activity is simple (like Tic Tac Toe). No complex activity, in a fair world, will have completely equal outcomes. If it seems that there are completely equal outcomes for a complex game, you won't have to look far to find the one asshole that sits above everyone else (who within themselves have equal outcomes).

Upward mobility will become more difficult in a fair, leveraged world because our activities are more complex and more difficult to be good enough to contribute to the economy. Therefore you can't use difficulty of upward mobility to measure fairness in a system. That's like saying Chess is unfair because I can't be as good as Magnus Carlsen.

Human progress makes the world more fair by increasing leverage and spreading it wider.

Today, even in many of the poorest communities around the world, many kids have the ability to create, and speak their minds in ways their grandparents couldn't dream of. They have access to knowledge through the internet that is barely any less than the richest kid in the world. Yet, the rich child who has access to higher quality, personalized, feedback, more competent, ambitious peers, a stronger safety net, and more supportive parents, has an unfair advantage. We must democratize these advantages to all. As we do, we'll find the world becomes more unequal.

A world in which every child has loving, supportive parents, the best teachers, freedom to explore what they want, no concern for how to make al living, with great leverage (takes little time to implement any idea) would be incredibly unequal: the richest person would be unfathomably rich.

In a highly leveraged world, slight differences between individuals are magnified. Slight difference in choices lead to drastic differences by death. The greater the leverage, the greater the difference between individuals at death because the more varied their explorations are.

Not all explorations are equally worthwhile. Someone who spends their entire life learning how to craft the best baskets to sell to their village will not have the same outcomes as someone who explored building software products for large audiences.<FootnoteReference number={4} />

***Twins born a century ago, on average, would have explored life less differently than twins born today.***

We haven't even taken into account the difference in our abilities at birth. It's silly to think that we're not born with different capabilities, different strengths and weaknesses, different emotional reactions to the same stimuli. 

The more complex a system, the more difficult it is to find two things that are equal: in Go, there are fewer equal board positions (in which both players have equal chance of winning) than in Chess or Tic Tac Toe. Nature is an incredibly complex system in which finding two things that are equal is almost impossible. No two trees are the same, no two rocks are the same. Humans are not created equal.

In a fair, highly leveraged world of complex activities, winners take all because outcomes in a fair world better correlate with ability, and complex activities have greater inequality in ability no matter how much training a player has.

Unfairness can also cause inequality. But the shape of the inequality caused by unfairness is different than the shape of the inequality caused by a fairness, leverage, and high complexity.

Unfair outcomes have more rigid class boundaries, and is more difficult to move from one class to another. Systems that tell you what you can and cannot do with your life, that you have different rights and than others, that make it difficult to move upwards based on ability are incredibly unfair.

The graph of outcomes in an unfair world looks like a step function. You will find different classes, and you'll see that there aren't any individuals with outcomes in between the outcomes of the two classes. All factory workers would make roughly equal outcomes, whereas all factory owners would make roughly equal outcomes, but you'd find very few in between the workers and the owners. This is a symptom of unfairness.

Inequality that stems from a complex world with fairness and leverage is a smoother curve: you will find individuals at all sorts of different outcomes. We can see this in the outcomes for our board game examples: though the difference between the best and the rest is large, if you plotted everyone on a graph, it would be a much smoother curve than the one you would see if you plotted all outcomes in the industrial revolution.

Unfair outcomes are actually more "equal" because they have more people that are making roughly the same, but just divided by classes. Whereas the inequality from fairness and leverage is far less equal because it's tougher to find even two individuals with the same outcomes.

Therefore unfairness should not be measured by the difference in outcomes of the best and worst, but rather by seeing the shape of the curve of outcomes. The more groups of equal outcomes, the less fair that society is.

Complete equality (like the outcomes of Tic Tac Toe) can be fair but only when the activity is simple. No complex activity will have completely equal outcomes - there will always be someone who sits a step above a group within which everyone has similar outcomes.

Many incorrectly believe the rising inequality in our world is primarily due to the world becoming more unfair. They point to how much more difficult it is to rise upwards. But in a highly leveraged, fair it would be incredibly difficult to rise upwards because our games are more complex and we make moves more quickly, therefore competing with the best becomes more difficult.

Therefore difficulty in moving upwards does not necessarily mean unfairness. Though we definitely have unfairness that causes difficulty moving upwards, which we must eliminate, as we make the world more fair we will find it more unequal than before.

Human progress makes the world more fair by increasing leverage and spreading it wider.

Today, even in many of the poorest communities around the world, many kids have the ability to create, to speak their minds in ways their grandparents couldn't dream of, and have access to information and knowledge through the internet that is barely less than the richest kid living in a Manhattan high rise.

Yet, it's undeniable that the rich child that has access to higher quality, personalized, feedback, more competent, ambitious peers, a stronger safety net, and more supportive loving parents, has an unfair advantage. We have a lot of work to bridge this gap. When we do we'll find the world more unequal than ever before.
