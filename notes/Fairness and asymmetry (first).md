Still, we can't accept any conclusions about asymmetry without thinking about fairness.

The real world fairness is not equally distributed. In Chess, if it were the case that one player had 10x more time on the clock than anyone they played would almost certainly beat them - given they've all had intensive professional training for their entire lives.

But the inequality that stems from unfairness looks very different than the inequality that stems from fairness.

*(image of two worlds - the more equal world looks like a step function, whereas a more fair world is smoother).*


In a world with greater equality of outcomes, an outlier is more likely a result of unfairness.

This can be true while it's also true that upward mobility is more difficult. But the reason is that upward mobility is more difficult because we have outdated habits, not because of unfairness. The level of unfairness is decreasing as a function of leverage (may need to substantiate).

(*Fairness has nothing to do with luck. It could be possible that someone finds themselves at the right place at the right time for some reason. That is very different than saying that there is inherent unfairness in the game. I'll explore in a later essay luck vs. skill, but a more fair world will lead to greater asymmetry.*)
