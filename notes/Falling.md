Accept the reality: you're falling. You're not in a headspace to create. You're just able to consume. But, the more you consume, the worse off you feel.

If you don't curb consumption, you're fucked. It is a slippery slope that will simply crush you. Crush you. Absolutely.

If you don't stop content consumption, you're definitely fucked. Start your climb out of this state of mind by fixing your foundational habits:
- Useless content consumption.
- Maintain strong Sila - come what may.
- Daily 2 hours meditation - at a minimum.
- One meal a day.

If you don't do these things, you're fucked. That's the unfortunate reality of the world.

You need a break. Seriously. Your mental state of mind is key. You need to figure out a way to kickstart it again.

I'm just not in the mental headspace. I don't think Hyderabad changes anything tbh.

Bro, you're just unable to handle the pressure here. And it's telling. You have to figure out a way to build momentum. Seriously.
