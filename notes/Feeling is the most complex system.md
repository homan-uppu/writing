I made a claim earlier that the games we play are far more complex than Chess and Go. A good reader would have been annoyed that I offered no explanation. Even though my intuition led me to write that claim, the explanation wasn't as straightforward as I initially felt it would be.

There is a hierarchy of complexity for the games, and the most complex games we play are the ones in which success is measured by how good we make people feel.

And the representational complexity of feeling is far greater than that of Chess or Go. By representational complexity I mean how easy it is to describe the state of the game at any moment in time. A game that has a much more complicated state, likely also has many more possibilities for what moves you can take, and is therefore more complex in general.

To see why, recall when you had to communicate how you felt. You'll remember how difficult it is to do so, and importantly that no matter how many words you use, you weren't able to fully, completely, represent your feeling in words. This is because a feeling has a much higher representational complexity than words. Trying to represent a feeling in words is difficult because we are trying to represent something of a higher complexity into a medium that has less complexity. Information is bound to be lost.

It's precisely this lost information that allows for the various interpretations of words. Every single person reading this essay will have different feelings as they read this. Even though my intention is to make you feel what I feel about this topic, there is absolutely no way for me to do so without any loss of information, no matter what medium I use: words, images, videos, symbols, anything - even if I spend my entire life trying. This gap is quite large.

The representational complexity of Chess and Go can easily be represented by symbols, and therefore I believe that any game in which success is measured by how good you make someone feel will be orders of magnitude more complex than Chess and Go (proportional to the difference in complexity between feeling and a sequence of symbols). Therefore, the underlying asymmetry that we are moving towards is quite extreme.

As leverage increases, we move up the complexity hierarchy to play games measured by how good you make people feel. A couple of centuries ago, most workers spent their time playing games that had nothing to do with how you made someone feel. They'd often assemble physical things in a factory. As that region progressed, they built better technology to require less workers to manufacture the same thing, and also offshored more simpler work to other places, leaving workers to move up complexity towards services such as marketing, support, design, etc.

We notice this trend today as well. Programmers are being asked to become better at thinking about what to build and understanding users, without just thinking about how to build something. Animators are being asked to contribute something meaningful to the story instead of only translating a rough sketch into a completed animation. Pizza cooks, and ice cream store employees, are being asked to tell their stories on social media to attract more customers. Everyone is moving towards figuring out how to make people feel good.

And our feelings are far, far more complex than games like Chess or Go, leading to far greater asymmetry in the world than we see in Chess or Go. 

To see why, think back to the times when you've tried to communicate how you felt about something. The difficulty in representing a feeling in words (or any medium for that matter) shows how a feeling has a higher representational complexity than words, symbols, pictures, videos, etc. This why the same sentence is interpreted in as many ways as the number of readers. 

We do not yet have a medium that perfectly represents what we feel.

Yet, Chess & Go positions can easily be represented in words / symbols, which is why I believe that they're far from matching complexity of feelings. 

(*I don't believe we will be able to represent feelings as a sequence of symbols anytime soon because the representational complexity of feelings is so high that the complexity of symbols doesn't grow fast enough. It's a scaling problem and precisely the problem we'll need to tackle in order to get AGI that reaches human level ability. AGI is a scaling problem. I believe we will need to invent many more technologies before we achieve it.*).
