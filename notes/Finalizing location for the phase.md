OK, what is this going to look like?

1. *Living* is fixed = w/ fam in Mokila. There's no need to budge from this.
2. *Sitting* = on the rooftop. Create a separate space / nook that's used only for meditation. Use that space for absolutely nothing else.
3. *Work* = I'm leaning towards a really high end co-working space like this. I think it makes sense to spend a little bit more. I don't think that's a problem if you ask me.

How long will the phase be? It could be years. That's the honest fucking truth. It could be years. You're going to need a space that lasts that duration.

You also need a separate space for serious meditation. That's just as important as the office space. This could be within the office space itself - but NOTHING else happens in that room besides meditation. Protect the energy of the space with your life. Naps, etc. happen outside of that room. As soon as you enter, your mind must automatically start to settle.

The *quality of your practice* is going to determine your success. Absolutely nothing else. Your mind without the practice is not going to make it. Brutal. Honest. Truth.

1. Living
2. Working
3. Meditation

Minimum 2 spaces for these 3 functions. Eventually I want 3 spaces, one for each. I'm going to make this happen.

Alternatively, you can just double down in the single room at home. Don't come out. Yes. Be thoughtful about this. I can make this work, but it's going to be quite brutal. Not necessarily in a good way. The frustration is real. I'm disappointed with myself. Perhaps this is what is required.

The highest priority is finding the right environment to sit. Figure that out, and everything else takes care of itself. Honestly.

Why don't you build a sort of **shed** on the rooftop? With a tent underneath it. Give it appropriate shade. Get your 5 hrs a day in it. Come back downstairs for work and living (which will be in the same room).

If you can get the **secluded space** to sit, then you're set bro. Amen.

*So, here's the plan:*
1. Run a **1 week experiment** to not leave the room. Everything happens in room / rooftop. That's it. Perhaps a cup of coffee in the morning. And that's about it.
2.
