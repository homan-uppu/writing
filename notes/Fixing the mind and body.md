A 3 month complete detox for the mind and body.
Training the mind to achieve absorption at will.
Spend the days studying the Dhamma.

I can't execute anything without this foundation. I'm not confident in my mind to do / stick to anything. There is something fundamentally rotting inside, and I'm going to fix it.

Setting the right foundation is critical to taking off in the right way. Invest in this.

Get to 170 pound weight (77 kg). This is the weight that I want to reach, and maintain for the rest of my life. My body isn't benefitting from all of this excess weight. It's not healthy. I'm essentially overweight and my organs can feel it. Fasting is the most effective tool for this.
