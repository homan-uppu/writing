*Some thoughts on what's important*

- Bring the **VC <> education essay** to a point that I'm satisfied with such that if I had received such an essay, I would give it my time and attention, and stick with it till the end.
- **World class visual assets**. Presentation matters a lot. Need great assets to communicate the core concepts in the essay.
- **Socialize the essay**. Solicit feedback. Sharpen your thinking and make it more truthful. - this process will be tough to get started, but once you do it for one essay, it will become a lot easier for the next one. Cultivating a small group of individuals to get feedback from is extremely high leverage. The people you end up working closely with will likely originate from these feedback sessions.
- **Research in public**. Once I flesh out the essay and start socializing, I need to aggressively start building research momentum, and structure my research in such a way that makes it easy for future collaborators to see the top things on my mind, what I'm researching so that they can pitch in.
	- <my_domain>/research - is where this would live. organize the top questions on your mind in this dashboard and systematically build sufficient understanding to execute this.
	- Before starting this, would be good to have a rough idea for the roadmap to bring this technology to life (e.g. what would the MVP look like, who would use it, how to get them to use it, what role we will play as a platform, how "open" will it be, etc.)
		- Incentives and functionality of the platform should be set up to attract people to come join.

Once the clarity is there, strike quickly and aggressively. Think big. Raise the capital required from the absolute best people to raise from. Build a spectacular team (no compromising on quality, take as long as required to hire only the best).

This essay is the foundation for a much larger research project.
