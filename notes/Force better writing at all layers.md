I've noticed that for most of my life I was fine leaving rough notes very rough. Just high level scribbling and moving on. Not forcing myself to flesh out thinking reasonably well for one idea before moving on has held me back.

If I don't think a thought is worth exploring for a minute or few, then I shouldn't even be writing it down. If I'm writing anything down, then I need to raise the bar for the quality of the thinking before I leave that thought.

I believe this approach will greatly improve my ability to seek truth.

But, does that mean that there is no longer a need for the "Rough" folder? Nah, there is a need - for the daily notes.
