There are too many distractions. It's time to bring the mind back towards what actually matters from a big picture, long term perspective.

- *AI* improvements and what that means for us. How will we adapt as individuals and as a society. What are the key skills to thrive in such a world?
- *Investing in individuals*: a foundational shift in how we collectively allocate capital. There's a **massive infrastructure** to build for this. Actually, there is no other way for the world to evolve.
	- Degree of decentralization is proportional to how capable artificial intelligence is to identify fraud, understand intent and keep the system functioning.
	- Everything is connected to leverage. How badly we need such a system depends entirely on the capacity of artificial intelligence. I predict in the coming years as inequality skyrockets due to advancements in AI, we will see a strong demand for such a system of investing in individuals.
	- I think laying this infrastructure is actually more important than writing about what AI improvements means for how we adapt. If we execute this well, the team that builds this foundation will also have a large cultural function: to shed light on what AI actually means for what we do and how we do it. Amen.

OK, this all makes sense. I think Investing in Individuals is an extremely high impact direction to build for. In fact, it's the necessary opposite wing to the wing of AI. Without this wing being as strong as the wing of AI, there will be far more suffering than required. The bird will fail to fly. It's essentially building another country designed in such a way to completely engulf the world. The world will not have a choice.

I buy this. Make writing this essay (comprehensively) the focus. Flesh out the thinking, design the future, and craft a plan (that will work) to get this off the ground.
