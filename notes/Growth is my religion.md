Free markets are my temples.
Incentives / laws of nautre are my God.

the craving for wealth will be what unifies the world and replaces all other forms of discrimination with only a single one: haves vs. have nots. i believe discrimination is fundamental human nature, and thus i believe the discrimination based on wealth is the best form of discrimination because it's the only one that an individual can control.

it's far more difficult to control for the color of your skin, language, religion, etc. than it is to have control over how much wealth you have (which can be changed).

**business / trade is what brings people together despite their differences.**
a trade oriented community optimizing for economic growth will be the one that most quickly overcomes identity based infighting (based on religion, language, or any other kind of identity). Identity based politics falls to the side as more people will work with each other in the pursuit of wealth.

but the craving for growth must be sustained. complacency with what you have creates opportunity for identity based fighting again. it's a constant struggle to keep aiming higher.

the invention of money and financialization of the world, our shared chasing for economic growth is what has pushed the world forward. many seem to think that we've improved significantly in terms of racism, slavery, etc. over the past century because of some newfound morality, self-awareness and knowledge that our ancestors didn't possess. to me that feels silly. racism, slavery, etc. would continue to be terrible today if not for the economic growth that we've had.

why is that? economic growth amplifies the incentives that push for more economic growth. think of it as a collective craving for growth.

the more we crave for economic growth, the more our morality shifts to weed out features of society that hold back economic growth. Fundamentally, the fact of the matter is that racism and slavery, etc. were features that were actually BAD for the economy.

That sounds surprising, doesn't it?

the incentives that power the world also point in this direction. everything will become financialized, creating strong incentives for creating value for others in any form human activity.

Similar to how stagnant water is a breeding ground for mosquitoes, stagnant economies are breeding grounds for identity based discrimination.
