it might make sense to be here for a while - even after you have some initial traction.

you have an excellent "studio" set up here that you can make the most of. this keeps burn exceptionally low. this is good. this is healthy. keep burn very, very low, until you raise money.

use this phase as an opportunity to lay the foundation to ascend the right mountain:
- **strong mind** through rigorous meditation.
- **strong physical health** through excellent diet (OMAD) & daily yogasanas + twice a week long runs (10k).
- thinking things through to a great depth through writing.
