Firstly, I want to be clear, if there's any community I'm going to be involved with, it will be the absolute best - globally. Some of them surely exist in BLR, but the majority are (and will be) in SF. Undoubtedly.
### For Hyd
- Better physical infrastructure: absolutely world-class new spaces. Know folks with great access.
- Access to the filmmaking network (I'm a degree away from world class filmmakers, musicians, etc.). - You keep mentioning this, but you've never actually taken advantage of this.

Yeah, there's absolutely no reason for BLR. I'm just going to stick it out right here in my birth city and make it happen. Amen. If it ever comes to it, I'll just bounce to wherever I need to go to.
