I have more stamina than I've had in a long, long time.
Daily hiking up the mountain is a blessing for my mind and body.
Lungs feel great. Cutting down on fat. Weight going down.

I'm going to keep at it. Soon, will incorporate more workouts (for upper body and core).
Day in, day out.
Just keep at it.
