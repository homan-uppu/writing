there were discussions of this idea during the last two crypto booms but I'm not sure what came of it. what do you know about that? and why? also, what is your model of how pre-seed investors feel friction around this -- I'm assuming they would be early adopters if this solved a pain point for them? (I know a few who do talent investing, and I'm not sure if financial instruments is a bottleneck for them, but I could be wrong!) I like the idea on paper, but I wonder what the tweak that is needed for it to work etc!

The attempts I've seen failed to ground the token in actual value (e.g in actual equity in companies, etc.), and therefore remained purely speculative that were driven by hype and popularity of the token holder. Hype is not sustainable.

Similar to company dividends, a personal token shareholder receives a portion of any capital that the token owner gains from selling their equity in companies / other personal tokens - proportional to how much equity the shareholder has in the personal token. Therefore, the value of a personal token is grounded in the actual value generated by the underlying assets (companies / personal tokens). Without such grounding, personal tokens wouldn't last beyond a short lived hype cycle.
