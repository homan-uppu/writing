When we haven't yet built an intuition for how to act optimally, heuristics can help us be better. A heuristic is a strategy or an aid that helps us act more optimally in a complex game in which we can't possibly analyze everything to be perfectly optimal. They're shortcuts.

The optimal strategy is a function of leverage.

Good heuristics are dependent on a phenomena that is easily measurable and timely. With regards to growing asymmetry, the best metric to track is leverage because we can measure it relatively easily, and because it leads to asymmetry. If we only updated our actions after asymmetry has risen, then we're too late.

The marker I use to identify leverage in the world is how powerful the latest AI model is for the tasks that I do. Whenever the most powerful AI system becomes more powerful, I know that it's time to update how I do things.

The optimal strategy is only a function of leverage when the rate of change of leverage is slow. For example, today we see that it still takes time to see a bump in the power of AI models. The jump from GPT 4 to 5 seems to be 18 months. Of course, 5 - 6 might be shorter.
