NOPE. i'm not committing to this place. i'm going to be based out of someplace that is sunnier, warmer, with a Yogashala i can go to daily to practice, and fast internet and other productivity related infrastructure. that would be the best setup for me.

i'm **committing to this place** until I achieve escape velocity (can move to SF). that's it. nothing in between. either the Himalayas or SF. not going to live anywhere else in India.

**there are many ways to handle the cold well.**. i'm going to run every morning - working my way up to 10km every morning (run on road up to Maneri). this should be sufficient to heat me up for the entire day. i may also add some Ashtanga yoga in the evenings to again heat up my body, to stretch it out, and to sooth it through Pranayama.

## Productivity
- 300mbps internet connection
- desk
- chair
- heater
- rent office room.

(don't need any of the following. just raise the laptop to a good enough height - just the back - and you have something that is more than good enough for this phase. just stick with this.)
- laptop stand
- keyboard
- mouse
- ethernet dongle
- usb-to-usbc-dongles.

## Winter wear
- 2 tracks (tight-ish).
- big jacket
- sweater
- gloves
- 2 full sleeve t-shirts.

3 layers: t-shirt, sweater, jacket. this is the way to go. this should be more than enough for now. should be < 2k max.

This is all you need. and even in this, try not to buy too much.

## misc
- post Dec 12th, hire someone for cooking. source quality ingredients - organic when possible, and whatever kitchen utensils. get quality materials.

that is all you need. roughly a 50k investment you can set up your base for the foreseeable future - for as long as you need to achieve momentum. this is all you need. and commit hard such that no matter what happens, until you have the 500k to be able to move back to SF, you're going to stay here. Amen.
