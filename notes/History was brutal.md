I was having a conversation with someone the other day who longed for the times when the world wasn't incessantly obsessed with money and economic growth.

I was shocked to say the least. This is the best time in our world's history to be born a human. History was brutal. The modern capitalistic western system based on individual freedom is the best system we've had so far (line needs some editing i'd say).

Some notes on just how brutal the world was that I contemplate during challenging times to instill a sense of gratefulness for being born in modern times.

We have killed, raped, pillaged, tortured many due to the lies we've believed about ourselves and the world.
