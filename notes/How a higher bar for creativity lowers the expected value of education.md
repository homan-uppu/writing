### Theory vs. intuition.

Becoming competent in a creative skill is fundamentally different than becoming competent at a non-creative skill.

I break down learning a skill into two components. 
1. **Theory**: the rules, principles, tools, and best practices that enable you to express yourself in that skill.
2. **Intuition**: a combination of judgement, experiential understanding, good taste that enables you to create something that is actually valuable.

For example, in software engineering, knowing theory would be having an understanding of the programming language and framework to use in order to build software. For making music, theory would be knowing musical notation, and the tools needed to make music. For writing, theory would be knowing spelling, grammar and sentence structure to communicate ideas in a way that can be understood well by readers.

[TODO: need to put an example of what good intuition looks like here.]

The more creative a skill, the less valuable theory is on its own because it's not enough to express yourself in the skill - in order to be valued, you have to actually create value with the skill.

For example, if you want to be hired as a designer, it's not enough to know design principles and how to work with tools such as Figma, but you have to actually be able to design useful solutions to problems in order to be of value.

And so the higher the bar for creativity, the higher the requirement for the intuition component becomes because theory on its own doesn't translate to value.
### It's far more difficult to learn intuition than it is to learn theory.

Why? 

### Learning outcomes for creative skills have greater variance.
