They absolutely need to happen simultaneously. I think mornings for writing. late aft + evenings for outreach and correspondence.

Why simultaneously? Because outreach for the recently published essay will always be necessary.

There will come a time when you can reduce outreach because you would have the brand that would spread your ideas with less effort on your part (maybe this doesn't hold up, but I think it'll at least be less effort since I will have more leverage: brand, delegation, etc.).

Spend 80% time writing. 20% time outreach / engaging with the outside world. It's OK if collaboration takes a bit longer to form because the most important thing is still to flesh out my ideas (and therefore my worldview).

Start with a 70/30, and then will figure out how to change this.

It's also time to start tweeting again. But don't plan this, tweet what naturally comes to mind. And definitely tweet the thesis of upcoming essays. Will force you to be more concise and elegant - a fantastic forcing function.
