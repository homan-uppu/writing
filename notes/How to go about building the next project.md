0. **Network**:
	1. Get a tight-knit group of people who's feedback I greatly value, and make them my team to help me iterate on this product.
1. **Exhaustive design**:
	1. Iteration on the idea in words and rough sketches.
2. **Build MVP and get initial traction**.
3. **Fueling** (do in tandem with getting initial traction):
	1. Get a fucking co-founder. Yes. Don't go about this without a teammate.
	2. Raise a small round. So that you aren't burdened by money in the short-term and can whole-heartedly focus on the company. This will likely be the only fundraising you do for this company.
4. **Sustainable business**. Ramen profitable.

This is the right way to do things. Think it through. Attack it well. **No fucking around this time**, you only have one bullet left in the gun. You have to hit the target.
