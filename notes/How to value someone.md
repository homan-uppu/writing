*With regards to their ability to seek truth.*

Prefer younger, less conditioned minds. The older they are, the more proof I need to see of their ability to think.

*What is proof?*
1. Their ideas: ideally writing, but sometimes can be videos (esp the interview kinds).

In fact, that is the only proof. If they're simply a part of a company that is doing well (or even started a company that is doing well), I can't value them on that basis alone because unless they publicly share their quality of thinking, I'm not convinced in their ability.

There are two categories for each person:
1. Status (low, medium, high)
2. Quality

The absolute ideal is high quality thinking + low / medium status. High status will be too busy to respond, but it wouldn't hurt throwing a few of them there.

Also: high status also means they're likely outdated. That's because the habits they've built in order to gain the status they did are outdated. They will find these essays too counterintuitive. For the same reason to avoid the old. Actually I take this back. This was an incorrect conclusion.

Those that have achieved high status can still be great truth seekers. For example: Kunal, Naval, Bret Taylor, etc. These folks have done great in the past, and I believe will also do great in the future because they have the deep thinking muscle. These folks are very, very different from most others of their age who are too outdated.

Young. Low / medium status. High quality thinking.

Let's define these more precisely:

Young: < 40. (with some exceptions). Ideally aim for 20 - 30.
Status: Ideally <50k followers on Twitter.
High quality thinking: this is going to be quite subjective. Fortunately I have a large internal library of content consumed from a variety of creators. I'll need to rely on that to an extent.

OK, all of this makes sense. What is the next step here? Create a Notion DB. As you study your intuition for what makes high quality thinking, write it down. Write an essay for "What makes thinking high quality?" to help you process this. Amen.
