Human progress makes the world more fair.

Someone born poor 2000 years ago had very little chance to move up in life. They'd likely be an indentured laborer or worse a slave. They'd have little to no freedom. They'd be unable to speak their mind against someone richer than them. There were rigid class divisions in society. 

Even a century ago, most factory workers would likely never be able to afford starting their own factory one day because their wages would never add up to be enough, and because they wouldn't have access to capital (far fewer investors). Generally only those that had wealth had the ability to create what they wanted.

Today, even in many of the poorest communities around the world, many kids have the ability to create, to speak their minds in ways their grandparents couldn't dream of, and have access to information and knowledge through the internet that is barely any less than the richest kid living in a high rise building in Manhattan.

Human progress reduces the barrier to entry and spreads it wider.

Yet, it's undeniable that the child that has access to higher quality feedback, more competent, ambitious peers, a stronger safety net, and more supportive loving parents, has an unfair advantage. While have a great deal of work to do, and we shouldn't stop pushing for a more fair world. But the world is more fair than it has ever been in modern history.

Every humanitarian effort. Every improvement in technology. Every advancement in medicine, government policy, etc. will all help us get closer to a fair world, that will simultaneously be more asymmetric, unequal.
