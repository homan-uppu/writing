Seeking truth is all that's there to do.
Tackle the most important questions you can think of.
And recursively continue down the path of seeking truth.

That's all there is to do. In fact, writing this essay will show me exactly what I need to do. Powerful.

I can also see myself doing this forever. I'm addicted to seeking truth. (the best thing to be addicted to, though eventually you should graduate from this as well).

And I'm also loving the writing process. The questions I'm asking are forcing me to better understand things. And that understanding is fulfilling.

And I'm also looking forward to sharing it with others for feedback, and I can't lie, for their appreciation as well. That craving for external validation is also at play, naturally. I can see it in myself. I just need to work towards de-conditioning the craving for external validation.

But, I should be thankful for the craving for external validation, because otherwise I wouldn't share any of my understandings. I'd just leave the modern world. Fascinating thought.
