Just have to start with the characters. Get to know them. And let the characters build the world for me. I don't have to do anything myself. I just have to follow the characters and **listen** to the story unfold within myself.

This is also seeking truth. You are not creating. There are no "gimmicks" here. No calculations. You are simply listening to the mind. That is all you are doing. Just listen to it.

I definitely feel the ability. It's there. You just have to channel it.
