It's the deep seated understanding that the "creative" path of filmmaking or something else is also, just as equally devoid of the deep, satisfying fulfillment that I crave.

The Truth has shown me that such a deep fulfillment is impossible in the external world. And hence I don't trust my intuition to just "try one more thing". Lol.
