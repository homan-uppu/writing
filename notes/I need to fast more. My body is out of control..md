I must, at any cost, bring my weight down to 75 / 80 (max). I'm at least 10kgs overweight. This is a monumental problem. Must overcome.

And yes. I'm burnt out. I need to accept this and work my way back. Firstly, my concentration is off. That's the biggest hurdle for me right now. Can't even put my mind towards something for an hour.

I'm suspecting the internal fungal overgrowth is impacting my concentration function. And that's why the one meal a day really improved my ability to think. It had an immediate, direct correlation on my ability to operate my mind. I must go back to fasting.

I'm back on it from this moment onwards. I'm also going to ramp up to a weekly 48hr fast (basically skip one day of OMAD and wait for the next one). I'm going to couple this new diet with weights / running (alternating between them).

Need to bring my body back under my control.

Just stick with it brother. This is the path. To reign in the mind, you must first reign in the gross actions. Only then will you have a chance at grappling the mind.
