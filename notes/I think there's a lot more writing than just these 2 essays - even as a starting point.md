But, ofc, don't think about this just yet. Focus just on these 2, and then later see if it makes sense to continue publishing more.

But, I'm feeling that I'll definitely need to continue this process of writing. There's just so much learning and growth through this process. Can't imagine starting anything without sufficiently laying this "foundation of understanding".

But, products are also an incredible way to learn about and study the world. Writing while doing something is also better because the writing is grounded in actual experiments that study reality directly (via the market).

Anyway, this isn't the time to think about this. Getting back to writing.
