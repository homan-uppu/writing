This is what i want most right now. this is why i'm going to lean into writing. i want to write and discuss powerful ideas with extremely sharp people.

this is a skill that will compound. as long as i keep sharing good ideas with the world, and keep engaging in thoughtful, meaningful discussions, i will keep growing in the ways that i want to grow.

i just have to keep at it. there's a strong intuition inside of me that says that i need to keep writing.

I have a lot of ideas on my mind. I guess I'm a sort of "idea guy" who can also build, but enjoys the process of coming up with ideas more.

Of course, I'm not committing to anything right now, I'm just going to keep at it whenever I feel like it. I've only committed fully to 2 essays. That is all I'm going to commit to for the time being.
