this place is magical.
my routine is working.
the mountains are quite literally showing me that my peace and happiness are found within.
there is nothing that i NEED from the world at large. my family, and my friends and acquaintances in this village are all i need. i can thrive without status, without crazy wealth, without recognition or validation from the world.
thus, i feel more confident in both myself about the path i've chosen for my life.
keep seeking truth.
