bec. i have access to OU - which is honestly unbeatable.
there is a beautiful 10k run through OU which is incredible.
rent is free (thatha's), giving me the means to invest in a great creative studio.

and i know i can get some place pretty much for free in amberpet / dd colony for as long as i want. a ton of family and flats in that area. for sure.

my burn would just be internet and food (one solid meal a day).

would need to leave home by 6am latest in the am for the run - before all the traffic, pollution, vehicles, etc. get home by 7 / 7:15, shower, sit, make chai and get started by 8:30 / 9am at the latest.

grind till lunch (around 11am / noon). rest for an hour or so. start up again till evening. sit. read. pass out. rinse and repeat until success. lol. life really is that simple. amen.

and feel free to invest however much you want on a stellar chair. you already have a desk you can take over. and buy a mouse, and you're all set!

consider this when the time is right.
