This chapter focuses on implementing the Network *at launch*, and not how it ought to be implemented later on as the Network matures. In other words, this is the implementation of the "MVP": minimum viable product.

### Network at launch

**1. Core functionality**: everything in the "How it works" chapter above - the ability to join the Network by creating a personal token, raise capital through discrete fundraising rounds, invest in personal tokens, and sell your equity in a personal token to others.

**2. Selective admission**: the core team will vet the initial set of users to ensure that they're "high quality" individuals who are ambitious and operate on long time horizons. Early users will have an outsized impact on how the Network evolves, so it's important to get the right people on board: people who are also invested in the system of investing through personal tokens, in addition to wanting to invest in individuals.

**3. Centralized power to tackle fraud**: the core team will have the authority to ban users who try to lie / manipulate for profit. Users can complain to the core team about anything they're suspicious about, and the team will evaluate and take action. In the early days, even a small suspicion will be enough to blanket ban users because we won't have the resources to deal with each situation in a nuanced way. Since there will be a lot of capital changing hands for each fundraise, it's better to be safe than sorry.

That being said, each decision to ban a user will be transparent: it will be recorded on the personal token itself (on the public ledger) with an explanation +/ evidence for why the user was banned.

As mentioned above, as the Network matures, this reputation system must become more decentralized and nuanced such that users are impacted according to the severity of their lies / actions. As decentralization happens, users that might have been banned earlier, will have more ways to challenge their bans and rejoin the Network.

**4. A web application** for users to access the Network and its functionality.

**5. High touch onboarding and support**. Raising capital through personal tokens / investing in personal tokens will be a new behavior for most users, therefore, it's important that we spend more time than we think we should to ensure that everything makes sense to users, and be quick to personally jump in and help nresolve any issues they may have. This personal, human, high touch approach early on is critical to build trust in the Network. Until the Network achieves critical mass, users transacting in the Network are not only betting on each other, but also on the technology of personal tokens, as well as the team building the Network. We ought to be grateful for their bet on us, and express our gratefulness by serving them as best as possible.

### Technical

Network will be implemented on: [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) + [Base](https://www.base.org/) (best developer experience, fastest growing ecosystem & the org behind it - Coinbase - is solid).

Transactions will use [USDC](https://www.circle.com/usdc) to eliminate unnecessary variables in personal token valuations, minimize volatility.

### Legal

A personal token is a new kind of financial instrument, and therefore, a large part of its implementation is in the legal instrument that represents a personal token and supports its functionality.

I'm working with lawyers to draft a clear legal implementation plan and will share details when the time is right. We will approach regulations head on by treating personal tokens as securities and working to remain compliant with all laws and regulations surrounding securities such as filing a Form D for each fundraise, etc.

In addition to the legal implementation, we'll need to make compliance simple for users of the Network, through education, standardized templates and filing on behalf of users wherever possible.
