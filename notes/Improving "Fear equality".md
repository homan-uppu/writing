*I think this is actually far from being great. And I ought to push to make it great before focusing on outreach. Give it another 2 weeks.*

- Fairness increases the correlation between ability and outcomes.
- I loved Nanna's analogy: "we live 100 lives in one" => 
- "Even if you're wrong to an extent now, this heuristic will only get better as the world becomes more fair - which it is - because fairness increases the correlation between ability and outcomes".
- There is a simpler explanation for how the best on an average team will flock to being average on the best team. People already understand this, but the forcing function to make them move isn't strong. As asymmetry grows, it will become even more evident who is better than the rest - to both themselves and the rest in ways that weren't as apparent in a more symmetric world. And since average teams accelerate towards being irrelevant, the best of average teams will have no choice but to quickly flock to being the average on the best teams, further aiding the fall of not-the-best companies. (this is the gist of the argument).
- Subtle differences in ability are magnified due to greater leverage. Increasingly small differences lead to massive differences in outcomes.

- Need to present the counterintuitive points up front. One paragraph is enough. Show the current tendency and how that will fail. This is critically important to have up front, because otherwise, people aren't convinced of how they're failing until you show a particular way in which they fail.
