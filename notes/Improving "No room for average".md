There's a need to balance this piece. It feels too negative that it's not delivering the message that I want it to deliver (to myself). After reading it I shouldn't end up feeling like I have no shot. I should feel inspired to take advantage of the opportunity presented.

The flow is this:
- There is increasingly less room for those that are average at what they do. By less room, I mean
- Average is a relative term: it is defined as __.
- You are probably average. I certainly am.
- We are tending towards a "winner take all" dynamic for most human activities.
- This trend is a one way street. It is not reversible without blowing up humanity and essentially reversing human progress in all the areas we care about: human rights, etc.
- Even making the world more fair: distributing access to opportunity more equally will actually amplify the winner takes all outcomes.
- (Something about: the complexity and time it takes to train to be great at it - is sharply increasing).
- We will absolutely require universal basic income as most individuals will not be able to be great (by definition! - it is a relative measure).
- Sadly, I don't believe a basic income will ever "feel enough", and even if that "enough" ever arrives it won't last. Even if you believe otherwise, it doesn't make sense to design your life in a way that expects it because that would be giving the keys to your wellbeing to someone else.
- Evidence in our current world: (show the "paradoxes").
- Therefore, if you're young, you have no choice but to be more ambitious and great at what you do. And if you can manage, you will see that there has never been a better time in human history for someone like you.
- **And for the first time in modern history: taking what seems like the riskier path will actually be the safer one for most people.** - I really like this framing.
- And the change will hit us sooner than we expect. All of us will be surprised how quickly the winner takes all (most) dynamics will penetrate every single human endeavor.

Then justify how these changes are a one way street.
And make something clear: being great at a new thing the world doesn't yet value doesn't mean they will value it someday - or value it before you die. - this is important to get a sense of.

Debunk the following:
- It is not temporary, it is a one way street.
	- *It is independent of how good we are at training ourselves*. The more complex the activity, the greater the difference between the outcomes of two individuals even if they had the best training program and spent their entire lives training - in the most optimal way. This means better education, training will not somehow make outcomes more equal as it did in the past. Someone even slightly better than the next will capture most of the outcomes.
- It is not just due to increased competition, but an increase in the complexity of our activities.
- It is independent of fairness. In fact, a more fair world would actually have greater asymmetry, and less room for the average.
- "Average" is a relative term. The degree to which there exists people in the world such that if they replaced you in your team, your team would do better, is the degree to which you are average. - yeah, need to define this much, much more clearly.
	- Eventually you will only be great if you do the thing that you are uniquely the best in the world at, that it is impossible to replace you with anyone in the entire world to do what you do better than you. (this is wrong! - there will be some people who are great at what they do that we will not care about).

Reduce the talk on why universal basic income will never feel enough. Just say that I suspect that it will never feel like it's enough, and also that if you're young and believe you have the potential to be great, you shouldn't design your life expecting sufficient basic income to come your way when you want it to - because by doing so you're basing your wellbeing on an external factor. Avoid it if you can.

- There is less room for average in any domain. Whether you want to be an artist, politician, a terrorist, or a human rights activist. An average terrorist will not be able to induce terror as there are greater protections due to increased leverage, it too will require a "great" one, and that one will be responsible for most of the terror in the world.
- This is not just due to increased competition. That is only one of the factors, but I don't think it's as impactful as a rise in leverage is. An increase in leverage automatically leads to the next generation to be better and more competitive. But increase in competition doesn't explain why it will always be asymmetric. Increase in competition could mean that eventually everyone trains themselves well to be great, creating more symmetric outcomes again. But that is not what will happen. We will not see more symmetric and then less symmetric outcomes, it is a one way street (unless we blow everything up). That is because the complexity of our activities are increasing due to leverage and that complexity is not going downwards.

...

The angle must be clearer:

1. No room for average.
2. Be great.
3. The bar is rising.
4. The power law cannot be stopped.
5. Progress makes the world unequal.

 The underlying is the same: asymmetry will rise sharply due to human progress. Great. Now, what is the conclusion of this essay?

Do we even need a conclusion for this essay? Can it just
