I want people to be more greedy. So greedy that their greed forces them to cooperate with those they previously considered to be too different, or beneath them. Greed is how we overcame slavery in most of the world, not compassion. Any race or community 

I want our battlefields to be the marketplace, not our borders.
I want kids to grow up craving to build better products than other countries so that they can take control, not to build bombs to bring them down.
