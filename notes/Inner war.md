The only battle is the inner battle. There is none other.

It's foolish to search frantically for an external solution when you already know that the only solution is one that can be sought inside of yourself, through the practice.

I know the exact cause of my inability to write - my mind isn't balanced enough. And it's not concentrated enough to see how imbalanced it is and work to achieve greater balance.

The weeks when I was incredibly productive were a natural byproduct of the increased samadhi of my mind. Anything else that helped only helped by contributing to the Samadhi. With that Samadhi I was naturally able to apply the practice to build balance and go deeper into my mind.

This is abundantly clear.

So why are you just letting time slip by when you understand the root cause? If the cause is in the mind, your solution must also tackle the mind, no? There is no other way.

I simply need to sit through and sharpen my mind in order to be aware of and see all the crap going on inside. That is the only path. There is no other way.

I also need to keep in mind Anicca. I was clearly attached to the previous "state" of mind, and now that I don't have it, and unable to be productive, I feel like I'm worthless. That's not what the practice teaches. That is nothing but the game of sensations. The goal of the practice is to build equanimity with ALL states and conditions of the mind, not just the ones you want.

And Samadhi itself is anicca: it comes and goes as it wishes. When it is low, it's my job to recognize it and then work extra to bring it back to acceptable levels.

**Recognition of impairment** of a critical faculty (Samadhi) is a critically important skill. And the thing is, you already do this, but you don't do it in the right way.

The right way is to not be dejected in any sense by the changes in your own Samadhi. Right now, when your Samadhi drops, you become dejected to an extent. It's getting better, but you're still reacting to it! And this reaction creates a vicious cycle of getting worse, and you drop into this pit.

So, it's time to pull yourself out of it.

What I'm going to do now:
1. Cut out all information consumption (including music). I need to consume nothing in order to write this essay. Everything is based on my bare observations about obvious things that don't require extensive referencing of any sort.
2. Start with a one hour sit. If you feel that you have the mind to write, then get to writing. Else sit for another hour.

The habit I'm going to develop will involve just sitting more and more until the mind is where I want it to be.

And until it's at a sufficient quality, I'm not even going to attempt to work with it.

That is the algorithm. And it's a quite simple algorithm. Amen.
