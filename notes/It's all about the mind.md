The city you're in doesn't matter.
The desk you use doesn't matter.
The quality of your chair doesn't matter.
Your internet speed doesn't matter.
Honestly, even your laptop performance doesn't matter. (you're just writing for fucks sake).

All that matters is your mind.
Do you have a sharp, concentrated, balanced mind? If you do, the work will be done. If you don't, you'll always feel like adding that "one last thing" to your productivity set up in order to finally be able to create what you want.

Fuck the set up. Fuck craving for things outside of states of mind. Make the most of what you have. Once you gain momentum, you can go splurge on whatever the fuck you think makes sense. But, you'll sooner or later be reminded of this lesson again.

It's all about the mind.
