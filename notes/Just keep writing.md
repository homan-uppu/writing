re. my strengths, I will never become one of the best engineers, and therefore I'm not going to spend a moment on that. Gain leverage and collaborate.

My speciality will be vision, strategy, story. That is all.

The starting point for all of this is to think hard about the education system. Show the flaws and paint the vision for the system that will replace it. This is my first task. Do not stop until you craft the right vision for this. Vision is everything.

Get momentum with writing first. This is the fastest feedback loop process to improve my thinking and storytelling ability. Gain momentum with writing. Use momentum to enter video. The first video itself should meet my bar. It may take a year to produce, that doesn't matter.
