Absolutely. This is 100% the place to be. This is where you're going to make it. Back against the wall. Written off by the world (pretty much). You have nowhere to go but up.

Drop the ego. Be genuinely helpful. Connect with those you respect. And see this phase through. Amen brother. Amen.

This is the formula to elevate your game. And, keep your head in the game: you have to focus on the game plan with intensity. Amen.

This is the sort of leaning in that's required in order to thrive. Absolutely.

I have the confidence in my self. I have the skill and wisdom (from my years of failing) to be able to see this through. Amen.

For the foreseeable future (at least 3 years), this is the place I'm going to be. This is where I'm going to do my work. This is where I'm going to build a team. This is it. Amen.
