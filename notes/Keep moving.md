I keep falling into this trap of waiting to feel like writing before I start writing. That's a limiting habit.

Inspiration is a byproduct of motion, not idly sitting around hoping for it to grace me.

The start is the most difficult. Once you get moving, it gets easier. You build momentum. Halfway into it you're so into it you forget what held you back at the start.

Keep moving forward no matter how you feel.a
