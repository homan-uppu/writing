I have a compelling path. I'm going to take it.

This phase will require me to be the *most productive* I've ever been.

*This phase will last:*
- Worst case: years (> 1 year)
- Best case: 3 months. (Raise and bounce).
- Realistic expectation: 6 - 9 months.

---

What I need during this phase:
1. All chores taken care of.
2. Solid monitor setup (the grind setup)

I agree with Dad: getting an office space near Mokila (or in Mokila) would be ideal. With rent <= 15k would be perfect. Grind at the office. Come home for dinner and to pass out. Can even do Yoga at the office. Amen.
