I agree. But, I also believe that the distribution is rapidly changing to become more skewed towards personal tokens because the power law distribution is becoming more pronounced in all kinds of work.

The degree to which personal tokens are preferable vs. debt is proportional to how extreme the power law distribution of outcomes becomes. The more extreme the power law, the more risky debt becomes because less will be able to pay it back (median outcome falls as power law becomes more extreme).

Which is also why financing startups through debt is so rare - because outcomes follow an extreme power law distribution.

Lastly, I'd like to share a personal story that shapes my feelings around this idea:

I'm an American who's spent half of his life in India (including 4 rigorous years of competitive high school trying to get into IITs - India's equivalent to KAIST). I personally know many peers from that time that were forced to study things they didn't want to because their exam scores didn't let them get the major they want.

That sounds absurd to most people in the west who I share this with, but that's still how the education system here works - you need a high enough score to get the major you want at a good college (or you can buy a seat - which only the rich can afford). For example, my best friend had to study petroleum engineering instead of what he wanted to: computer science. In such a hyper competitive education system, if you don't come from wealth, the world literally shoves you down a very narrow path of possibilities that takes a long time to climb out of. Most don't.

If personal tokens had existed when I was in high school, I'm confident that some of my peers would have raised capital and gone on to do great work because they would have been more able to follow their true interests. I don't think I was talented enough to be invested in (i promise this isn't false modesty). I lucked out because I was American and had the privilege of coming back to the US for college, but there were gems of minds that didn't have the opportunity to blossom the way they were meant to because there was no way to invest in them early on. A tragedy for both the individuals and the world. A tragedy that I don't want to ever witness again.

Firstly, I absolutely do. i spent around half a year dealing with my initial negative emotional response to this idea. i did not want to pursue it for exactly the concerns you mentioned (and tbh, i'm a bit shocked at how similar our concerns are).

I still have concerns, but I now believe there are ways to minimize the negatives, maximize the positives such that personal tokens would be a net-positive for the world. 

I'm also aware that my stance might have shifted to be more positive out of a subconscious desire to profit from this. Incentives can warp our minds. This is why I'm reaching out to people like you to help me see if the approaches I see to tackle these concerns are grounded in reality or not. A sanity check of sorts.

The primary concern I see is: young individuals raising capital may feel great pressure from investors to "grow at all costs", similar to the pressure that startup founders face, but lacking the life (and perhaps biological) maturity to handle it well. Without proper guard rails / protections, raising capital through personal tokens could exacerbate the many mental health challenges in the world, and could box individuals into a life path that is overly influenced by investors.

Approaches to tackle this:
1. There are absolutely no "voting rights" for personal token shareholders in ways that company shareholders have. There is no question of direct influence of decisions that a personal token holder may take.
2. **Reputation system**: Personal tokens exist in a network (both investors and individuals raising capital must join the network in order to buy / sell shares in personal tokens). There is a reputation system in place through which complaints made by a personal token holder about a shareholder (for example, that they are harassing them, or pushing them to move faster than they're comfortable with, reaching out too often even when asked not to), are used to impact the reputation of an investor in the network.
3. In the early days, only allow investors who are very long-term oriented and are patient to wait for long periods to profit. (I have a criteria for this that I can share later if you're interested).

On top of this, I strongly agree re. need for education: those raising capital through personal tokens must clearly understand what they are getting into, their rights, and what kind of behavior to expect from shareholders, and what to not tolerate. Especially in the early days, the team behind this network will be deeply involved through high touch support for early users (esp those raising capital), and will be involved in helping shape the norms for this personal token shareholder <> owner relationship. 

> So I would not want to help create a financial system that pushes young people to lock themselves into a particular career very early.

I believe raising capital through personal tokens is actually more freeing than taking on debt to finance education for those who don't come from wealth. 

In order to pay back debt, many are pressured to take low risk, immediately paying, opportunities in order to earn the breathing room to follow their true calling - to do the kind of work that they can be great at. Raising capital through personal tokens allows them to finance more ambitious explorations according to how they want to (assuming the investors are on the same page - which will be established at the time of the fund raise).

> What if the personal token holder never starts a company? What if they just work for Google for $5M/yr because they're an amazing ML researcher, or starts a freelancing business that takes off as a sole proprietor? Would you take a portion of their personal earnings? That seems rife with moral problems.

No, personal token shareholders never touch salaries / earnings. Personal token shareholders ONLY get a percentage of the capital the token owner gains from selling equity in companies / other personal tokens.

In your example, say you invest $100k into someone who never starts a company. You would still profit if the equity they gain in the companies they work at become worth a lot. I see this is a feature: personal tokens enable investing EVEN in highly talented individuals who may never want to start companies, but only join great ones.

> This feels like a pretty efficient market already, fulfilled by the talent/recruiting industry. What gives you conviction that there is further incentive here that isn't accounted for by current economics?

The market is far from efficient. 

There are many individuals who have the potential to create great value down the line, but must wait until they're ready to (or want to) start a company, or are capable of being hired, in order to be invested in.

Similarly, if there was a way for investors to invest in individuals *before* they are ready to start / join companies, they would because it is possible to spot talent much earlier on (e.g. a high schooler who shows glimpses of becoming a great, say, designer, but still has a lot to learn before they can be hired - would be invested in), but that talent market doesn't exist yet because there isn't a way to bet on talent at that stage.

The current market may be efficient (which I strongly doubt), but there also exists a very large talent market earlier in the lifecycle of individuals that doesn't yet exist, but would be very valuable if it did exist.

(more examples of the kinds of individuals who aren't being served, but could be: https://personaltoken.vc/white-paper#examples)

You could also argue that scholarships / grants already exist for this unserved audience, but the capital available through personal tokens will be far greater (by orders of magnitude) because the desire for profits scales capital far greater than the desire to do good.

> Why do you think this kind of financial instrument would be preferred to debt on both buyer and seller side?

(Seller side) From the perspective of an individual raising capital by selling equity in personal token: they are more free because they not burdened by debt and can therefore pursue more ambitious, risky ideas that they could not have if they knew they had to repay the capital... similar to how startups raising capital can be far more ambitious than companies funded through debt. 

(Buyer side) From the perspective of an investor, they capture far more value through equity. By loaning capital they'd earn a small profit on a high percentage of loans, whereas by buying equity they would earn a ridiculously high return on a small percentage of bets.

The power law distribution of outcomes is becoming more pronounced in all kinds of work (as a direct consequence of AI - I've explored this argument in greater detail here: https://homan.sh/vc-learning). The more extreme the power law distribution becomes for all kinds of work, the more it will make sense for investors to try and buy equity in the few, but big, winners, vs. small profit across many.

> What does a personal token derive its fundamental value from, apart from being a speculative store of value?

Similar to company dividends, a personal token shareholder receives a portion of any capital that the token owner gains from selling their equity in companies / other personal tokens - proportional to how much equity the shareholder has in the personal token.

Therefore, the value of a personal token is similarly grounded in the actual value generated by the underlying assets (companies / personal tokens). Without such grounding, personal tokens wouldn't last beyond a short lived hype cycle.
