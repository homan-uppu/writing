i could invest some money in an office space here. the right desk, and a good chair, and reasonable wifi. this would extend this phase indefinitely. yeah. no other place offers such a productive physical environment as this place.

my point is that it's not like BLR / HYD is going to improve productivity during this phase. the bottleneck is the thinking, not internet speed, screen size, etc. it's literally just about having great ideas.

think more about this AFTER working out of the homestay for a day w/ WiFi. that will help you understand where the infrastructure here is at.
