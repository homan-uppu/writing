organize your ideas.
write so that you give yourself clarity about what the most important thing to work on is.
and then build the right foundation: team, company, etc. and execute smart and hard.

get the idea and foundation right.
making sure you climb the right mountain is the most important thing right now.
once you get the mountain right, then shift focus towards the execution.

keep at it.
and continue to tame the mind.
nature helps greatly. so do hikes and walks through nature. 
prioritize access to such nature for the rest of life. this is super important.
