I'm looking to work with someone to help me improve the quality of my writing. Specifically, I'd like their help on:
1. Feedback

I'm NOT looking for basic spelling, grammar, or even sentence structure feedback, but rather higher order critical feedback on whether my words are communicating what I want them to, and my ideas are reaching my audience.

### Qualifications
- purpose
- job description.
- location.
- level of commitment.
- how we will collaborate.
- this is NOT a ghostwriting endeavor. you will be publicly credited for your contributions. (e.g. "thanks to <> for reading drafts of this essay and providing feedback").

ideal candidate:
- not just someone who can communicate well, but also has strong intellectual rigor and a deep hunger to understand the world.
- not limited by rigid boundaries. - your role / title / identity does not stop you from doing what you think is necessary to do a great job.
	- examples: 

i'm in no hurry / not desperate to fill this role immediately. finding the right person is the most important thing.
