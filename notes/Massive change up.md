There is no change up that makes sense. Changing location isn't going to change your life. Well... it actually can. But it has to be a significant jump without return until the milestone is achieved. Only if you take it with such a strong determination will it work out. Otherwise you will be worse off than if you had stayed here.

That strong determination can happen right here in Hyderabad. The office space is more than good enough.

But, there is a much more powerful possibility if you're up for it. An intensive sadhana in the *right location* for at least 6 months. Ideally a year.

I'm convinced this jump would be beneficial. Need to determine the optimal features of such a retreat.
