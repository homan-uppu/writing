There really is an exploration here of what it means to build a healthy mind, that I think is incredibly necessary to pursue.

And yes, there's a lot of work to pursue on this topic. For sure. 100%.

Once again, no planning whatsoever. Just take it one day at a time.

Do what comes the most naturally to you. Don't force it on the regular. Every now and then forcing is necessary to meet a deadline or something. But, on a regular basis aim to let it flow out of you naturally. With ease, yet working "intensely" to the outside world.

Zestful ease.

Finding a natural rhythm.

I'm really inspired by how the masters lived their days.

Doing nothing. Absolutely nothing.

> **Questioner:** And what do you like to do when there’s nothing to do?

> **Sadhguru:** I do nothing. I really do nothing. These days, I’m not getting that time, but if I shut my doors, I don’t read, I don’t look out of the window, I don’t turn on the TV, I don’t look at the phone. If I close my doors for four, five days, I don’t have a single thought for four or five days, and that’s the best time of my life.

That's actually brilliant. I definitely need to build this art of doing nothing. Without any stimulation whatsoever.

This is both an intention and a skill to be able to do nothing. It's an art. I need to incorporate this into my life a lot more. Seriously.

Drop your fear. Be in your natural state without any qualms.
