What xnote should have become.

https://hq.getmatter.com/ -> a beautiful product that is tackling a worthwhile problem.

This just goes to show the value of sticking to it, ignoring competition and building something great by actually innovating. Powerful.

One thing though: it would be nicer to have the discovery and everything on the platform itself? Right now, Matter's discovery is quite limited: only about a hundred or so writers / creators that they let you discover.

Anyways, there's a powerful curated creators + their content angle here.

I'd like to just give a link to someone like Shubham / Raghav / whoever I'm working with that seems kind of new to the field, I'd like to just give them a list of reading & people to follow to help them build their intuition over time. Hmm... interesting idea.

That's just one person curating. What if anyone could curate. And then you could follow curators as well, not just creators. That's powerful.
