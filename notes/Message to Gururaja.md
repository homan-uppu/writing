Namaste sir. All good. I have not been practicing regularly. Even when i do, it's not the complete sequence that i have learned.

I'm working towards slowly getting back into it. I would appreciate any guidance, though I know that it is mostly a matter of my own will and not something that anyone can really "help" with. I also find that if I practice at the Shala, I'm very consistent. But, I also don't want to have to depend on a Shala to maintain my practice because a Shala won't always be available through life.

Unfortunately my Bengaluru trip / move has been postponed indefinitely due to some work here, but I'm hoping I will come practice in person with you soon. Thanks for checking in on me, it means a lot, and is motivating.
