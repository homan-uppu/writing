Bro, just wanted to say I'm super proud of you man.

I still remember like it was yesterday the night we saw Schindler's List in the BioTech lecture hall, and while eating Pizza you shared how difficult that phase was for you.

You've come a long way. Whenever I hear you talk about how much you're enjoying your work and how well it's going, I feel a lot of joy. Anyone who knows even a fraction of your journey would feel the same.

Wishing you continued exponential growth. I'll be actively learning a lot from you these coming years - hopefully in person :).
