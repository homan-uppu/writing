OK, I'm convinced. I can easily shut myself in this room and really crank.
Basically run the highly efficient experiment again. This time you have a room that is conducive to it.

You can do the one meal a day easily if you don't allow yourself to leave the room and get distracted by all sorts of things. Amen.

Do the same thing: ask Amma to drop off the carrier upstairs at 6pm every day. I'll eat that food and that's it.

Only come out once the goal is reached. An intense Deeksha.
