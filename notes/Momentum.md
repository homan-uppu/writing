I'm quite excited about this phase. I'm finally seeing the right way to approach writing. Start the first essay at a very high level of abstraction. Dig deeper in subsequent essays if you feel the need to. Never start with a low level of abstraction - that's a sign of poor judgement, and that will hold you back greatly.

You will eventually get to being able to write a larger book. But that time is not now. You're far away from having the necessary intuitions about communicating ideas to be able to do so effectively.

Write short(er) essays, publish them and connect with people you're quite aligned with in the world. I promise you they exist. I'm excited to form those connections, and build up a tribe of peers that push me in the directions I want to be pushed in.

Keep shipping brother.
