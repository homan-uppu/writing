I see what I must do. I’ve spotted my weakness.

My weakness is that I experience a strong agitation “kick” that pulls me in a direction that I should not be going in. I need to build the strength to be aware of, and withstand, the kick, no matter how strong it is.

My mind is trying to jump to some other location to practice more deeply. Yet, this craving to practice in a certain way, in a certain place, is an unhealthy kick. If I actually go to Gangotri to practice, I will see that my mind is far from prepared. I will be eaten alive.

Before embarking on a longer meditation session, I need a solid foundation. My foundation is incredibly flimsy. It’s not even strong enough to maintain perfect Sila. I’m breaking Noble speech far too often. I’m not balanced. I’m wasteful (of energy).

I need to build a solid, imperturbable, foundation. Without this, I won’t be able to do anything meaningful. It’s time to level up my mind.

I need to give myself at least a year to lay and reinforce my foundation. Committing to anything less than a year for this program is stupidity and is a consequence of your agitation, nothing else.

I want the following routine:  

Every other day a full day sit (14 - 16 hours). The entire day. From when I wake up till when I pass out. One tiny meal during the day - if that. Fasting is also possible.

But, I will need a little bit of time to build up such endurance. I tried this out today and felt I need a bit more training to work up to being able to do this consistently.

Thus, for the first month, I want to sit 8 hours a day to start the day. 6am - 2pm every single day to start the day. Really sharpen the sword of the mind, and only when I’ve sufficiently balanced myself will I go onto work. Every Sunday I'll do a full day sit, come what may.

After the first month, I'm going to start alternate day full sit and see how it goes.

Regardless of the path, I know that I must be spending an order of magnitude more than what I am now, on the practice. The practice is the only thing that can save me.
