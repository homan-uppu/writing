I absolutely need to work on the mind. My mind is my worst enemy. I have all the opportunities in the world. I am the only one stopping me from reaching my potential.

There is a lot of work that I need to do.

How are you going to plan this? How is that "work" going to come? When will it come? Do you have the commitment or are you just saying things?

Another problem you have is the underlying understanding that all of your problems stem from your mind. You have absolutely no external problems whatsoever. All of your problems are internal.

Damn. There is so much work that I need to do on myself.

I don't even know what to say.

I also don't feel confident committing fully to the path. Why not? What's stopping you? **Why don't you explore that first?**

I've built up so much conditioning to "do something" in the world. And I can't seem to let that go. Even though I fully well understand that my external accomplishments aren't going to satisfy me. They'll never fulfill me at my core. They will always be superficial.

And even within the paths that I explore. I can't budge without giving an honest attempt at storytelling. There is something there that I need to run one serious experiment with. That's all I need. One serious fucking experiment. A validation.
