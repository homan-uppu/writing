There is no way to have great external impact without a strong foundation of internal peace. You cannot rely on external progress to give you the peace / "hit" you crave for. Your wellbeing must come from within.

It's only when your wellbeing comes from within, can you act optimally for the world outside of you.

This is so true. When my mind starts to dip (more sluggish, more "heavy", more difficult to work with), I find that it's due to craving things outside of me. As the mind rebalances, the craving reduces, and my mind is in a much healthier condition. Craving is the root of suffering. You already intellectually understand this, but need to reinforce this understanding frequently because it's difficult to internalize.
