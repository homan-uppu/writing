All I want is to connect with great seekers. That is all. The purpose of sharing my ideas is to discover and connect with them. Identifying and connecting with the most competent seekers is the higher priority action now, and likely for the rest of my life.

I'm going to reach out to 20 people today.

*Given this clarity, the strategy is clear:*
- Set up the infrastructure (Superhuman, Notion CRM, etc.)
- Define how you're going to measure progress: i.e. how many people to reach out to every day, etc. Keep a strong cadence.
- Craft the best messaging.
- Execute hard.

*Done for the time being (this will be revisited again).*
- Update essay to be more powerful. I have a sense for how to make it an order of magnitude more impactful. Do this first.
- Write the criteria for how to value someone (with regards to how good they are at seeking truth).
- Write about the strategy to seek great seekers: i.e. what does the search process look like in detail. Which platforms, etc.
