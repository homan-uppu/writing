My current path is simply to write. That is all I must do. Nothing else matters during this phase. 

Write to:
1. Build clarity on the path to take
2. To train my ability to translate feelings into words.

Train yourself to not worry about what the world is up to. Play your game at your pace. It's incredibly important to build sufficient clarity before jumping into a very long-term game. This time around, whatever I choose, I'm going to stick with it for decades. That's my commitment. Therefore I must make sure what I'm committing to is worthwhile.

Train your mind to be more balanced so that you don't veer off course. Writing helps you be accountable. Reference this note whenever you have questions about the path you're taking and why you're taking it.

When does writing fall from being top priority? When it's time to build. That's it. Until you have that sort of clarity required to build, all you're going to do is publish writing. That's it.
