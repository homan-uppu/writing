I think it has to do with the 3 day sit. My mind is working more smoothly than earlier.
I still have a great deal of inner agitation that I must work through. I had a glimpse of it during the self course. It's within the layers of the mind. The anxiety. The pressure. The burden.

The mind is still incredibly weak.
The mind still needs a tremendous amount of work.
Stay humble.
Put in the work my friend. Put in the work.
