I want to always be close to nature. And not just any kind of nature, but nature made nature: areas relatively untouched by humans, not the overly constructed / artificially designed spaces that are considered nature.

E.g. the mountains here in which people haven't planted the trees or arranged them in any particular way. everything is the way nature has designed it to be.

not only does it feel great for my heath, it's a wonderful reminder to surrender to the greater powers that dictate how the universe operates, to silence the mind and my inner drama so that i can experience Nature unfolding. Powerful.
