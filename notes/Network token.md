The Network Token is similar to other personal tokens except that:

1. It is not tied to any individual user, but rather to the Network itself.
2. Its shares can be traded freely without requiring anyone's approval.

Whenever equity in a personal token is sold on the network through a fundraising event, a small equity stake (0.1%) in each personal token is automatically granted to the Network Token as a "transaction fee". The more fundraising rounds for a personal token, the greater the Network token's equity in that personal token.

  

Therefore, the Network token's portfolio represents the Network itself.

  

The Network Token is divided into 10 million shares that can be freely traded, allowing anyone to invest in the overall growth and success of the Network.

  

As with with personal tokens, whenever a user sells their equity in any personal token, say Amy sells her equity in Jane's personal token, a percentage of the capital gains falls into the wallet of the Network token proportional to how much equity the Network token holds in Amy's personal token.

The wallet associated with the Network token is considered the treasury. To balance operational needs with shareholder returns, when new revenue enters the treasury, 30% is immediately distributed to Network Token shareholders, while 70% is retained in the treasury to be used for legal compliance, development of new features, security, and anything that's is required to preserve the integrity of the Network.The Network Token is similar to other personal tokens except that:
