1. Create a list of at least 100 (to start with) semi-popular individuals who write, that I desperately want to connect with.
2. Reach out to the relevant ones for essay feedback.
3. Eventually, reach out to more in order to get feedback on what it means to write well, and how to learn the craft. Publish this as an essay.
4. Use the learnings from the research above to design a writing copilot, or some training system, to enable a person to write more effectively. This would be when things launch. Interesting.
