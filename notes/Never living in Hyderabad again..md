After a month of being out of the city I can view my time there more clearly, more objectively.

Hyderabad pulls my mind back towards my younger days when I used to live there. That's not a healthy mindset to be in at all. More immature. Naive. And just outright stupid. Perhaps other areas of Hyderabad could work - living situations in which I rent my own place. Perhaps. But living outside of the city is much better for me.

Hyderabad will be the place that I might visit every now and then to see family, etc. But, I don't want to live there again.
