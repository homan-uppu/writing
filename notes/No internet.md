A strict block on information consumption from here on out.
I do not need to consume anything.
I do not need to publish anything.
I simply need to study what IS.
I simply need to process my life's experiences in my mind's eye. That is all the "external" inputs that I need during this phase - which could last days, months, years. Who knows.
