That's an itch I can't shake.

I keep coming back to it.

Now, it could be because I feel that it's unfinished business. It could be because I'm familiar with it. Comfort in familiarity.

I'm not sure. I'm not even sure if I should lean into it and follow it. But it is what it is. I'm not going to fight it. It pulls my attention so hard that I can't focus on other endeavors whole heartedly. I don't like the lack of agency in other areas: I'm forced to depend on others and external money in ways that I don't really like.

Perhaps it's the underlying craving for status that knows the direct path of product building and how that leads to momentum. Perhaps it's the craving for collaboration and building relationships with others that pushes me to take the quickest path for that craving. I definitely think the latter is a much more powerful craving than the former. I crave to collaborate intensely with others. I miss that feeling thoroughly.

Whatever path I choose, I must remember that it will not quench the thirst I have. Nothing will. That is the nature of the mind. If you forget that you'll keep thinking that "this isn't the path for me". That feeling will come up no matter what path you take. That is the nature of the human mind.

**The truth is that any path when taken deeply becomes deeply fulfilling. That is because you thoroughly enjoy seeking truth. You thoroughly enjoy learning, understanding concepts at a difficult depth. That depth itself is inherently rewarding.**

It doesn't matter if that depth is achieved through editing a film, designing a product, or writing an essay. The depth is what is important.

It's time to dive deep. Very fucking deep. So deep that you lose yourself.
