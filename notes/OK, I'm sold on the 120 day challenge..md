Just start publishing, and after a few posts I think you'll figure out how to position the newsletter (if you even want to).

Amen. This all makes sense. Let's get to it.

Go for a walk, come back and crank out that first piece before shifting focus to the writing feedback system (which should hopefully take up the majority of the day for me). Amen.

Build this momentum so that you can sharpen the ideation and communication aspects of the mind. That definitely needs work, so put the time in. Amen.
