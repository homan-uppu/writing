this phase is all about execution.
create a strong state of mind. body. and work.

find out when the crop burning period is, and go off to the riverside to meditate there - i'm sure the air will be cleaner there. it'll be cold, but i'm sure you can deal with it.

i'm not sure how intense i want this phase to be. maybe in a month or so it'll get really intense. but i'm going to start slow and easy. what does that mean?

definitely: 5 day course, and write on the weekends. i'm confident this is the right strategy - at least at the start. hmm... yeah, i do think the start should be a 5 day self-course. it's sort of required to sufficiently subdue the mind.
