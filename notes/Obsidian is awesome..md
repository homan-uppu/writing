Minimal theme (@kepano's) is brilliant. Feels just right. Everything is stored as just markdown files, backed up to GIT, giving me full flexibility for how I process my writing. And I know it's entirely in my control.

This is a powerful system. I'm going to lean into it for now. Use nothing else. Just lean into Obsidian for now.
