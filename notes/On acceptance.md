One of the keys to mental peace is accepting that any Sankhara could come to the forefront of the mind at any moment.

Accepting it allows you to minimize guilt towards it. When you're guilty of having a particular reaction, or you have strong aversion towards it, it actually makes it a LOT worse when you do have that reaction: it causes a vicious negative chain reaction, becoming worse and worse.

You must acknowledge and accept the hidden volcanoes.

Build moment-to-moment awareness of sensations in your body, and stay in the present moment.

Even if you're using your imagination to design, visualize, etc. do your best to still keep a part of the mind aware of sensations on the body.

And lastly, forgive yourself. You're going to have reactions in the future and maybe even in embarrassing situations. Pat yourself on the back and forgive yourself. That's will help.

Have the confidence that you're walking the path of Dharma. And that sooner or later you will overcome all of your unskillful mental tendencies / Sankharas. You will be victorious over your mind. Patience is required. Persistence is required.
Godspeed.
