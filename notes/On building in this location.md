Lack of solid internet is killing ability to build. Perhaps I can only focus on writing and reading without much building work possible. Not sure how to approach this / what makes sense.

Or, you can just Google Docs the damn thing / upload a PDF of it without worrying about having a "site" or any of that nonsense - at least for now, when you're getting started.

The primary goal ought to be to iterate on this idea well... not get prematurely caught up in the ornamentation. And, you can still make the images world class... but, probably not bec. it would be good to have a solid internet connection when iterating on those images, etc. so that you can use AI services, etc.

OK, so how to adapt to this reality? Ignore "building" anything and focus on writing + sketching things in the notebook. That feels like the best approach.

Before I share this with anyone though, I def want to build a stellar presentation. The presentation is important for me. very important.

OK, so what's the gameplan here? Knock out stellar drafts of 3 essays instead of just 2. Clearly describe the image assets you want to create in each image / animation location of each essay. Design the website. Don't think beyond that for now. Knock all of these out right here, and then process where you're at and what comes next. That's the way to go.
