i'm going to say **NO** to every single thing until I ship two essays:
1. Why venture capital will eat the world.
2. Seeking truth is the only skill.

i'm not going to TOUCH anything else until these are completed and shipped at an exceptional level of quality.

the only thing that is stopping me is my ability to ship things well. this is the muscle that i seem to lack based on anecdotal evidence. what stops me is my impatience. my inability to continuously deal with the crap that the product must go through before eventually arriving at something great. i'm going to build this muscle now, come what may, with a strong determination to see projects through.
