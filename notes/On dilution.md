Issuing *new* shares for fundraising rounds is better than having a fixed number of shares for the lifetime of the personal token because:

1. it helps the value of a share be more closely aligned with actual value created by the PT owner.
	1. without dilution, the early investors' equity appreciates far more than what it ought to.
2. it's more fair to future investors by not unfairly rewarding early investors, and giving room for future investors to participate meaningfully.
3. it gives greater power to the PT owner: they don't need permission from existing shareholders to bring on board new investors because they just issue new shares. this makes it easier for the PT owner to stay above a minimum equity threshold (which exists so that a PT owner can't sell off too much equity).
