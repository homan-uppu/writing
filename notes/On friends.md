Anyone who does not give me great feedback on my essay in my friends group, I will stop sharing with them my ideas. If they're interested in consuming them, they'll just have to follow my socials and consume it from there when it's published. I will also be quite cautious about engaging with them with ideas, or brainstorming because I believe they're not great at crafting ideas.

That feels overly harsh, but I don't see a better strategy. I need to minimize the time it takes to connect with exceptional people. The primary purpose of writing is to be able to discover and connect with great truth seekers. I only want to spend time with those people because they are the only ones who I'm aligned with.

The more I think about the paths that my friends have taken in life, the more differences I see between us. If I had no friends today and was tasked with making friends, they would not be close to the kind of people that I'd want to be friends with. Absolutely not.

This is a painful truth that I can't deny. As the Buddha said: "friendship on the path is everything.". That "path" could be anything, but whatever path you are walking on, you must befriend others who are walking on that path, not some other path. That is the only way to maximize your progress on the path that you are walking.

My friends and I have taken very different paths. We seem to want different things, and have taken very different approaches to life itself. The older we get, and the more moves we make in life, the more apparent our differences become.

This is the final test to see how aligned we are. I will only engage with those that give me great feedback on my first essay (jisnu.org/fear-equality). Those that don't, I will stop engaging with them with my ideas. And eventually, entirely.

The "entirely" is also important. Every conversation you have with people influences you. Conversations with those taking different paths will influence you in ways that aren't productive for progress on the path that you're on. Therefore if I want to maximize progress on the path that I'm on, I will soon have to eliminate all casual conversations with those I'm mis-aligned with.

To be clear, I will absolutely engage with the world through my work. But that sort of engagement is different than the sort I'm talking about eliminating. I need to eliminate the brainstorming, the casual conversations, etc. with those I'm misaligned with. On a work level, I will absolutely interact with many, many people who I'm misaligned with, all I'm saying is that I won't form deeper relationships with those I'm misaligned with.

This is the strategy I'm adopting. I'm giving my friends 2 weeks to show their ability to give me great feedback. And then that's it. They can always give me great feedback later and I may change my mind if they do, but I will categorize them as too misaligned at the end of these 2 weeks if I don't receive great feedback from them. That will be June 3rd e.o.d. Amen.
