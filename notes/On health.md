if you can strictly eat once a day (and one cup of tea or something a couple of hours before the one meal), you will basically solve the majority of health. you can augment this with Ashtanga yogasanas, running and the occasional strength training (specifically for the core and back), and you will be more than set.

this is all you have to do.
more than doing, it's about not doing.
do less, not more.
concentrate the mind such that it's at ease.

this is all that you can do. this is all that needs to be done.
the body is in a constant state of decay. there is only so much you can do. beyond that, you must surrender to the forces of Nature, accept reality, and find the peace within which is not conditioned by decay. there is such a possibility within.

absolutely fascinating if you ask me.
