if you can strictly eat once a day (and one cup of tea or something a couple of hours before the one meal), you will basically solve the majority of health. you can augment this with Ashtanga yogasanas, running and the occasional strength training (specifically for the core and back), and you will be more than set.

the biggest question is how to set up the system that best enables you to do this?

i have a desire to do a sprint in BLR 2 - 4 weeks in BLR. daily morning yogasanas at the Shala. weekly group sits (there's the HSR Vipassana group that sits together every Sunday I think?).

the advantage of going to the Shala is that i can benefit from a system that's already in place.
