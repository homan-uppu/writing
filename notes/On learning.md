In order to execute this app well, I'll need to significantly level up the following:
1. Spline. This is an absolutely incredible tool. I'm going to be using this for landing pages, in-app interactions and even scenes for videos! Absolutely incredible.
2. Figma. (General design sense).
3. SwiftUI. (Master it. Go from idea to execution stupidly fast).
4. Stellar landing page design and execution.

Growth:
- Waitlist based launch (Study the greats: early oneplus, mint, robinhood, Superhuman, etc.).
