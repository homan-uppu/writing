I have a growing desire to move.
Actually, the desire isn't to move. It's to socialize. I'm craving it. Deeply.
I think I felt it this afternoon at the restaurant. Surrounded by all of those people. I liked that feeling. I liked the thought of bumping into a friend there and starting a conversation.

I miss socialization. I really do. Absolutely. But what I realize I miss more is having a better grasp on how the world works. I'm finally able to think things through and arrive at relatively more of my own conclusions. And this has been illuminating. How I thought the world works is quite different than how it actually does. The gap is large.

So I'm going to keep at this. No matter how uncomfortable this phase is, I'm just going to keep at it. I honestly don't see any other way. There isn't. That's the truth. Seeking truth is the only thing you can do. The only thing that matters.
