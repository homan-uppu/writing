Don't talk about things that don't need to be talked about.
I had a divisive political conversation today that was absolutely unnecessary to have.

There's was no need for me to have a political conversation. It was not productive. It does not change the outcome of anything that I'm working towards.

I need to be much better about **not engaging** in such conversations. They hurt far more than they help. This is an invaluable skill to develop: to know what to engage with and what to slide by.
