This is a long path.

I've made a plan for the practice that will take me to a long course in 2025/26.

And from that point on, I will be doing a minimum of a 30 day course per year. And after that, who knows how often I'll sit.

It's so relieving to feel my path. And to not worry about the outcomes of "side paths". Amen.

And I'm going to use this "let it come" mindset even with work. Do the best I can, while remaining ever calm and patient with regards to the results. Amen.

Patience is everything. Amen.
