There exists a 10x practice and lifestyle. I'm far from what I know is possible.

I need to generate the optimal lifestyle right here. Right now. This is not something that I can only have when I'm living in some mountains somewhere. I must have the practice right here, right now.

I'm OK with doing a retreat. That is fine. In fact, I'd recommend that. Clear your mind.

But, the most important piece is a stellar daily practice. This is the foundation to build upon. I need to train a better mind. I need to remove all other distractions from my life. I need this.

Should be able to work entirely from this room. That shouldn't be a challenge. Mouna Vratam. Meeting absolutely no one until the job is done (except on weekends - meet people and work out of hip cafes).

I'm quite annoyed with myself. The present moment needs to be a lot more under my control... It's currently far from optimal.

The lifestyle has to change from right here. Absolutely.
