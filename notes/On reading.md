On days like this when I feel that my mind isn't sharp enough to create, I want to read the highest quality things that I can possibly read. I want a good workflow for this.

I also need to build a reading habit and eliminate watching habit entirely. When you do watch visual content, watch the best. Watch one film per week and pick one that pushes your understanding of what can be done visually. But don't consume visual anymore on the daily.

This will be tough to stick to, but I must. My mind will rot otherwise.
