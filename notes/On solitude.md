I want to be the kind of person who can thrive being alone, without the company of others. I also want to be the kind of person who can thrive in groups no matter how large.

Both modes of operating are incredibly useful. Both can become weaknesses:
- On the one hand, isolated people can quickly develop neurological disorders: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori.
- On the other hand, people can become addicted to socialization and feel unbalanced, and lacking, when they inevitably find themselves alone for some periods of time.

Of both, I think being calm and happy in solitude is far more difficult because it goes against our evolutionary programming. Even the most introverted introverts crave social interaction beyond a certain point, and if they don't receive it, will suffer greatly. Socialization, connecting with other humans, is inherently rewarding - even if it creates some initial anxiety when doing so.

To remain calm in solitude without hurting yourself is an exceptionally difficult skill, and yet incredibly valuable if you want to think independently.
