OK, let me give this a few mins first. I'm overthinking the next steps.
The only truth: I'm going to write my best drafts for the 2 essays: 
1. Why venture capital will eat education.
2. Ability to seek truth is the only skill. - present this well, but do NOT post this anywhere. This is the post that I will reference in a variety of places. It is my most core, fundamental philosophy.

This is what I think right now (re. what comes after):
1. **Revamp my personal site**. Implement the essays with stellar, minimal visuals that enhance the stories. Decide on the identity that you're going to move forward with.
2. Create a **DB of 100 people I want feedback from**. People whose opinions I respect. People who are at the top of the power law (or who I believe will be). Out of this, I'm going to start with reaching out to 30 of them who aren't yet high profile (bec. for those I want the essay to be buttoned up really fucking well - these are the PGs, Naval, Chamaths of the world. And there's also the crypto club that I need to hit up because there's a serious crypto angle here too). - this personal database you build is what is going to set you apart. find the best emerging talent and get involved with them. There's actually nothing more impactful than this according to the power law.
3. Having a **directional roadmap** based on my writing. Venture capital education essay will lead to many follow-up questions that I can explore. There is also a side product angle (curated knowledge base) that would be very interesting that I need to at least explore from a design angle. This roadmap could also just be more essays / other forms of content. It will take time for this to blossom. I need to be very patient. You can't rush great work.

I can do most of this here. At some point I will run into some serious friction (potentially), but will deal with it when I get there. And if it's too much that it's becoming too unproductive, I'm going to bounce / figure out a way to get solid internet here.

This makes sense. Ok, get back to writing.

There are no location thoughts. You must hit the required momentum first:
1. **Solid drafts of both essays**. (don't need great internet for these).
2. **Website updated with the essays**. (with updated design, and thoughtful, excellent presentation. May need internet, not sure, but if you keep it minimal, you shouldn't).
3. **CRM with 50 contacts to get feedback from**. Run the numbers. Don't expect more than 10 to respond and 2 to actually give you good feedback.
4. **Find an editor**. Someone in India who has evidence of excellent writing that you can hire on a per piece basis (e.g. 3k / piece or something). I'm hesitant re. how effective this would be. I think the feedback from the contacts above would be better, but nonetheless, this would still be useful to experiment with imo.
5. **Design doc, engineering spec, and memo of product**. (don't need great internet, or even any internet). - without a product / company angle to be able to make money on ( / raise money on), there's no escape velocity. therefore I need this in place. I might not execute on this idea, but I want to have something in my pocket. And through the design process I'm sure I'll uncover something quite interesting.
6. **Memo to self about what the direction is**. I.e. what is the problem I'm going to tackle, and roughly how. This is a memo I will write to myself to clarity my path. Doesn't have to be long. **But, it needs to exist.**

Without these 6 pieces in place, there's no way in hell I'm going to leave Siror, let alone Uttarakhand / India for that matter. Actually, it's not these 6 pieces. Let's take a step back.

You may freeze your feet off, but you absolutely cannot leave without these in place.
