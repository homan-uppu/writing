### The plan

Diet:
1. **Strict one meal a day**. No calorie consumption outside of that one, single, eating session. And strictly eating in a single sitting session (i.e. no refills, no 1 hour window, etc. Once you sit your ass down, that's it).
	1. For at least 3 months - towards the end of this year, it would help to be full keto.
2. **As Keto as possible**. No carbs except for naturally occurring carbs in vegetables.
3. **No caffeine**. This one is the toughest for me to adopt. I think I'll still need one cup of green tea or something in the mornings. Completely eliminating caffeine is a much longer program. Not going to be easy. (But yeah, you had a massive breakthrough you had no caffeine for a couple of weeks. That was tremendous.)

Exercise:
- **Daily Ashtanga**.
- **Special pelvic floor targeted session** of stretching and working it out. (This will also be done in bandhas, so there will be some overlap with your Ashtanga above).
- Bodyweight: pushups, planks, and other workouts targeting the core.

Lifestyle:
- Meditation to help relax the body and release any points in the body where stress has accumulated.
- Eventually shift to a floor desk, or better, a sturdy table like thing that you can sit on cross legged, and use the same table you're using.

If you can execute this for a year, you'll be in great health. Your body deserves this. You haven't been treating it well unfortunately. It's time to bring it back into health. Completely reverse metabolic syndrome.

I'd love to dedicate a year entirely to my health. Just writing and health. That's it. Probably somewhere in India. Or it could even be in the US. Just need a community of people practicing Ashtanga or something.

But you can't wait for that perfect opportunity because it may never come. You need to be able to implement this system NOW. Seriously. This is how life works. It'll never give you the kind of space and opportunity that you want, you must actively work to create that environment. That's the challenge, and you must rise to meet the challenge.
