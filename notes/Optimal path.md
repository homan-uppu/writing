*The "commandments". Lol. The strategy that enables you to benefit from a rapidly changing world. Everything is a function of leverage. Write it all out, and can then decide how to present - either all in a single essay, or multiple essays and then the aggregator essay.*

To do (there is no upper bound)
- Go all in.
- Overcome Jealousy / Build compassion.
- Don't get addicted / Balance your mind.

To do more (there is an optimality that is a function of leverage).
- Solve for people.
- Be more ambitious.
- Build intuition.
- Be more transparent.
- Do what you want. (But you don't know what you want)
- Distance yourself from the average. (how to identify the average).
- Think more before you do. / Be more creative.
- Pay less for education.

The culminating essay that I see for this body of knowledge is "How to educate yourself". This will put the entire body of knowledge.
