OK. Setting up a system that will deliver results.

**Given**:
1. Focus on **bridging the knowledge gap**. Either directly or obliquely (i.e. it might not seem that this is the goal, but it is). But, it must be something that I can benefit from as well. Knowledge consumption - a way to consume the best information out there.

**Writing**:
- I want a system that can help me write better. More powerfully, to the point, simply. It should help me see whether a train of thought flows or not.

Creation or consumption. These are the only two domains that I'd want to build for. They're the only ones that make sense to me.

Enabling creation, or healthy / better consumption of knowledge.
