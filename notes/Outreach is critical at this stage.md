It absolutely is. You need that initial set of peers to help you spread it wide. Absolutely.

And it's going to take effort to build that initial peer group that you can use as a launching pad. In fact, I wouldn't worry about writing the next essay before you get at least a few people to give you good feedback.

This is the right priority right now. In fact, it's not at all doing both! It's completely leaning into this and only focusing on outreach until you have that initial peer group. Amen.

Focus solely on this. Done.
