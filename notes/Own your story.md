I just want to focus on writing and communicating my ideas with the world. I want to find my voice.

And only after that, I'm willing to consider doing anything else.

From now on, I'm going to completely unapologetically live life on my terms. The way I want to live. Studying the things I want to study. And that's it. Nothing else matters to me.

Study what you want. Publish what you want. Be entirely yourself. Take things by the moment. Don't plan ahead. Don't commit to anything ahead of time. Follow the truth, no matter where it takes you.
