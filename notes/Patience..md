Building the foundation takes time.

Once you have the foundation in place, momentum will pick up more aggressively than you can handle.

This is the nature of great work. It feels too slow, and then all of a sudden it feels too fast.

Keeping the mind balanced and steadfast during all phases of the project is critical. You can't allow the slow pace to rush you into coming to the wrong conclusions and direction. You can't allow the fast pace to rush you into over-indexing on the present term and ignoring the long-term, or cause anxiety in your mind which pollutes thinking quality.

This is not going to be an easy path. Many of the ideas you propose will be highly unpopular with most. You won't be respected by the mainstream because it will seem that you are making the world worse by making it more unequal.

You need to become comfortable with solitude, feeling like you're crazy, and a certain underlying unease that comes from lacking the clarity on the long-term path. Each of these is a challenge to face internally. 

The practice will help you keep your mind steady, strong, and steadfast. Lean into it. You will need it to be able to walk this path productively.

Keep the mind steady.
Be your best friend.
