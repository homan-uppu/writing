Therefore, as our work becomes more creative, paying for education won’t make sense for most people because they won’t be able to earn back their investment. 

Unless we have a better way to finance education, access to opportunity will likely become more concentrated towards those who have wealth and can afford quality education. (todo: this may require an expansion. it may help to clearly frame the problem i'm trying to tackle: inequality of opportunity NOT inequality of outcomes - which is inevitable).

What options exist for young people in the united states?
- Scholarships to study at reputed institutions.
- Working at a company / apprenticeship.
- Study at free, state funded institutions.
- Learn on their own.
- Grants

**Scholarships**
While scholarships can be great for those who receive them, but they aren't available at nearly the scale required to be accessible. And the institutions that do have scholarships (merit and need based), have their own way of gauging who receives them and who is accepted - often a biased process that overlooks many with potential, but who are different than what is "expected".

**Directly working / apprenticeships**
Many young individuals who realize that paying a lot to go to college isn't worth it and are exploring ways to start working sooner. Apprenticeships seem to be available for many non-knowledge work trades, it'll be very difficult to break into companies without already having some tangible relevant skill that can create value right away. As our work becomes more creative, fewer individuals will eventually become good enough to create value within companies, and therefore companies will be more apprehensive about hiring for junior / apprenticeship roles.

This is already the case today in Tech: many new grads are struggling to land interviews, let alone jobs, and few, if any, of the fastest growing startups have any internship positions / new grad positions available. This wasn't the case in previous generations when you could more reliably train someone to become good enough.

**Affordable (or free) public institutions**
A natural reaction to the power law is to make education free for all. But, this won't democratize access to opportunity because as our work becomes more creative, the average education from the average institution will lead to no results, rather than average results as it did earlier.

This will happen because as AI gets better, and the power law becomes more skewed, the cost of quality education will skyrocket. This is somewhat counterintuitive because it feels that as AI improves it will provide quality education for all cheaply. 

But as AI is better at teaching something, the market will value something beyond that - just as how when computers could perform advanced number calculations, there was no more of a need to hire someone skilled at calculating manually. Similarly, if AI can teach how to code a certain kind of software well, then that skill becomes a commodity and the skill that becomes valuable is being able to leverage such an AI to create value.

As the power law distribution for a skill grows, so does the power law distribution for teachers of that skill. The more creative, the fewer good teachers there are, and the worse off the average teacher becomes. Therefore, in a highly creative world with an extreme power law distribution of outcomes, those who are capable of actually increasing an individual's chance of becoming one of the best at their skill will be invaluable and everyone will flock to them.

Making education free through the government paying institutions to keep them running only props up mediocre institutions with mediocre education. Nearly useless in a highly creative world because such institutions will never be able to afford those who are good enough at the skill to teach because their market value is far too high. And propping up such institutions may do students more harm than good because it will delude many into learning something that they'll find out in a few years that the market doesn't care for. These students will painfully realize that they've lost something far more valuable than money: their precious time.

**Learn on their own**

**Grants**
- Thiel fellowship
- Emergent ventures
- These make a lot of sense. 

Students from most other places in the world have even fewer options: if you don't get into the top colleges in your country, the next tier colleges are often incredibly mediocre.

(And most likely some combination of these approaches).

As a result, as our work becomes more creative, existing approaches to learning concentrate access to opportunity in the hands of those with sufficient wealth to finance their learning.

**this lack of access to opportunity IS the perfect segue into VC as the best way to finance!!!**

** disclaimer: this is for knowledge work. Non-knowledge work domains change far more slowly.
