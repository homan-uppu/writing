Therefore, as our work becomes more creative, paying for education won’t make sense for most people because they won’t be able to earn back their investment. 

Unless we have a better way to finance education, access to opportunity will likely become more concentrated towards those who have wealth and can afford quality education. (todo: this may require an expansion. it may help to clearly frame the problem i'm trying to tackle: inequality of opportunity NOT inequality of outcomes - which is inevitable).

What options exist for young people in the united states?
- Scholarships to study at reputed institutions.
- Working at a company / apprenticeship.
- Study at free, state funded institutions.
- Learn on their own.
- Grants

**Scholarships**
While scholarships can be great for those who receive them, but they aren't available at nearly the scale required to be accessible. And the institutions that do have scholarships (merit and need based), have their own way of gauging who receives them and who is accepted - often a biased process that overlooks many with potential, but who are different than what is "expected".

**Directly working / apprenticeships**
Many young individuals who realize that paying a lot to go to college isn't worth it and are exploring ways to start working sooner. Apprenticeships seem to be available for many non-knowledge work trades, it'll be very difficult to break into companies without already having some tangible relevant skill that can create value right away. As our work becomes more creative, fewer individuals will eventually become good enough to create value within companies, and therefore companies will be more apprehensive about hiring for junior / apprenticeship roles.

This is already the case today in Tech: many new grads are struggling to land interviews, let alone jobs, and few, if any, of the fastest growing startups have any internship positions / new grad positions available. This wasn't the case in previous generations when you could more reliably train someone to become good enough.

**Affordable (or free) public institutions**
A natural reaction to the power law is to make education free for all. But, this won't democratize access to opportunity because as our work becomes more creative, the average education from the average institution will lead to no results, rather than average results as it did earlier.

This will happen because as AI gets better, and the power law becomes more skewed, the cost of quality education will skyrocket. This is somewhat counterintuitive because it feels that as AI improves it will provide quality education for all cheaply. 

But as AI is better at teaching something, the market will value something beyond that - just as how when computers could perform advanced number calculations, there was no more of a need to hire someone skilled at calculating manually. Similarly, if AI can teach how to code a certain kind of software well, then that skill becomes a commodity and the skill that becomes valuable is being able to leverage such an AI to create value.

As the power law distribution for a skill grows, so does the power law distribution for teachers of that skill. The more creative, the fewer good teachers there are, and the worse off the average teacher becomes. Therefore, in a highly creative world with an extreme power law distribution of outcomes, those who are capable of actually increasing an individual's chance of becoming one of the best at their skill will be invaluable and everyone will flock to them.

Making education free through the government paying institutions to keep them running only props up mediocre institutions with mediocre education. Nearly useless in a highly creative world because such institutions will never be able to afford those who are good enough at the skill to teach because their market value is far too high. And propping up such institutions may do students more harm than good because it will encourage many into learning in a way that they'll find out in a few years that the market doesn't care for. These students will painfully realize that they've lost something far more valuable than money: their time.

**Learn on their own**
I'm starting to see some high schoolers correctly determine that paying for college isn't worth it (and that college itself is likely a waste of time), and are following their own curiosities to directly create value in the world through content, businesses, startups, etc. They explore and build with friends, cold message mentors for guidance, and are incredibly competent and resourceful. I expect many young, talented, individuals take this path in the coming years. They will build massive companies at incredibly young ages.

But, there's still the problem of how to sustain yourself as you create your own learning journey. For those who have access to some money (perhaps through family), this path works well. For those who have to find ways to make ends meet will need to get some sort of side hustle. While side hustles can be helpful to an extent, they quickly become quite harmful after a because they eat away at the time you can spend honing your craft. How much time you spend on your craft correlates to how good you can get at it. A rich kid with the freedom to create and build all of the time will likely do much better than someone who can only spend a few hours a day and weekends to hone their craft, even if the rich kid isn't as talented.

**Grants**
There are some grants available to enable individuals to explore and create on their own terms without the distraction of needing to sustain themselves. E.g. the Thiel fellowship (https://thielfellowship.org/), and Emergent ventures (https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures).

This is an incredible opportunity for those who receive it, but grants are too scarce and don't scale to be able to serve all those who would make great use of such money.

---

As a result, as our work becomes more creative, and given the paths available to young people, access to opportunity will become concentrated towards those who have the wealth to enable individuals to explore, create, and hone their creative skills.

While wealth is concentrated, talent is widely distributed. Therefore, most of the world's most talented individuals, with the potential to solve our most pressing problems, will be born into families without much wealth, if any. Without a better way to allocate resources to those with the potential, we significantly slow down human progress.

We need a way to finance education that doesn't burden individuals with debt that they most likely won't be able to repay, and also democratizes opportunity such that anyone with the potential to do great work will gain access to all the resources they need - regardless of the wealth they come from.
