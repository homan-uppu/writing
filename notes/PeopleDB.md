i want a way to "collect" interesting people i come across online. by "collect", i mean save a record with information about them: 
- who they are
- links to their profiles
- what they're interested
- why i want to connect with them
- what i want to learn from them
- notes from our conversations
- next steps (actions to take)
- have a way to manually fill out fields / even add entries. (this should prob be the starting point - without AI doing any of the heavy lifting. introduce AI once you have the flow down).

## Adding records
each day i will scour social network: X, Warpcast, etc. to find worthy individuals to add to the PeopleDB.

ideal experience would be to have a Chrome plugin and be able to just press a button (or keyboard shortcut) to save the information of the profile on the page.

AI should parse the page and fill out the fields of the record.
AI should also traverse the links on the page to their personal sites or other profiles and summarize what this person cares about.

## Enriching
- keep records up to date with periodic
