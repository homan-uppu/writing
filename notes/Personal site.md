- last published timestamp backed by a public GIT repo for just the /writing dir.
- a TODO block that visually distinguishes things that i still need to flesh out. be more comfortable publishing work with TODOs in it. reduce the time to publish.
- great feedback giving experience + good way to process the feedback. (and comments ought to be tied to a particular version of the essay).
- fix the image overflow issue on mobile.
- beautiful presentation: ascii art for essay "cover"s. that would be absolutely dope if executed correctly.
