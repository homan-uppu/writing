## some ideas
- Karthik Uppu written in cursive / Ji.
- Time to go back to using your actual name. Might want to cut some parts to make it good for SEO. Yeah, can't find a good SEO here. Unfortunate. Think about this later.
- "think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world" - put this quote on my landing page.
- "Work is worship"
- In addition to essays, I want a section called "shorts" that are much shorter essays without any sort of visualizations, etc. such that they can be rendered straight from a regular markdown file. I'll use these to mirror a tweet so that I can have it in my own record. or perhaps when the title is clicked, the tweet just opens up in a new tab. I'm not sure what the best option would be. Perhaps an "X highlights" would suffice.
- allow people to sign in with X / Farcaster and annotate the essay? interesting.

**newsletter**
- i def want a weekly newsletter in which i share what i learned, what i'm thinking about, what i did. it would be a powerful way to hold myself accountable and to think things through better (via writing). it's ok to skip a few weeks here and there... don't get caught up in the "schedule" of things. focus on the learning and the sharing.
- make it visually exceptional.
	- hover over a line item shows its bullet point summary floating to the right of it.
- fudge marketing a bit: "join hundreds and get my learnings in your inbox once a week (if that)."

- https://www.fostertype.com/retail-type/blanco - seems dope.

I'm going to spend time thinking about how this site can best represent me. It will be my "calling card". It will be something that I share with others often. It will be a **core part of my brand.** Make it great.
## brand
- 10^n: power law (capital). The 10^n is surrounded by all sides by the power law graph such that all the lines form to create a sort of square with a border radius. this feels right. the power law is what i'm basing all of my work for the world on. i'm betting the house on it.
