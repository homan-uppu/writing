1. need a "system" for outreach:
	- database - hit up every single person in your network without any shame whatsoever.
		- Doreen, etc. - every single person. without fail. the worst they can say is no. not an issue at all. don't allow the self to restrain you in any way.
	- daily quota
	- approaches:
		- email, X DM, in person events? - hit all the possible channels here.
