Hey,

I'm creating a financial instrument ("personal token") that enables an individual to raise capital by selling equity in their future ownership of companies (and other personal tokens).

Personal tokens incentivize discovering and enabling talent - especially talent that is overlooked & underrated. Therefore, personal tokens create the economic incentives to democratize opportunity.

I'd appreciate your feedback on an early draft of the white paper: https://personaltoken.vc.

*Cut:*
- *Personal tokens enable individuals to raise capital to finance their learning and -experimentation without taking on debt.*
- *Why? As artificial intelligence becomes more powerful, our work will become more creative, and outcomes will increasingly follow a power law distribution: fewer will capture the majority of the outcomes, and the median outcome becomes insufficient. [Paying to learn will no longer work](https://karthikuppu.com/vc-learning) because most won't earn back their investment on a reasonable timeline, if ever. Raising VC through personal tokens will become the best (and eventually only) way to finance learning as the power law distribution of outcomes becomes more skewed towards the top.*
