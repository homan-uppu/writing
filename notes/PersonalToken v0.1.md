### mechanism
A personal token is a fictional entity tied to a person (could be expanded to AI later) that represents their equity in other companies and other personal tokens (not personal assets such as homes, etc), that others can have partial ownership of.

Similar to CCorp companies, a personal token is divided into a certain number of "shares". Authorized shares are the number of units a personal token is divided into. Issued shares are the shares that are issued to people.

Say BobToken (a personal token for Bob) would have 10m shares authorized. With Bob's permission, Alice can purchase 0.1m of Bob's shares for, say, $100k. Alice would now be a shareholder of BobToken.

Whenever Bob sells his equity in another company or personal token, those who own BobToken would get their proportional share.

1 unit of BobToken would be valued according to what the market believes is Bob's potential to create value over the long-term.

BobToken exists within a network of personal tokens. In order for someone to buy shares in BobToken, they too will require their own personal token.

### notes

It may makes sense to limit the percentage of ownership in BobToken that can sell to others because while it's tempting to sell a lot of equity in exchange for capital out of desperation, it can destroy future potential because giving up too much equity in outcomes can kill motivation.

Preventing fraud is critically important. Investing in someone's personal token is a long-term bet. If investors are not confident that their ownership in a personal token will be honored well into the future, they will not invest. Fraud has been the major issue in NFT projects that has eroded trust. Cultivating and preserving trust is everything.

### On preventing fraud

Bob can only create one token in this network. This is enforced by collecting Bob's gov identification, verifying identity and using to ensure that one person can only have one token. (Or, can use something like [World ID](https://world.org/world-id))

Users need to be >= 18 years old, and in the US (required to have the backing of the court system in the case of fraud).

If Bob (who is selling ownership in BobToken) is found to be lying about how they will be using their raised capital in order to steal money (e.g. they claim they'll use funds to build products, but instead launder the money to an offshore shell company):
1. Bob will be kicked out of the network and never allowed to participate again (knowing Bob's real life identity helps enforce this).
2. Bob will be sued in court.
	1. Civil claims court?
	2. Securities fraud (involve SEC)?
	3. Who will 

As network becomes more valuable, being kicked out will hurt more. The hope is: there will come a point at which the long-term consequences of being kicked out of the network will outweigh the potential short-term gains through fraud such that there is minimal fraud. Yet, there will always be certain people desperate for short-term gains through fraud regardless of long-term consequences (human nature).

In order to enforce these rules, this network will need some element of centralization. There is no way to enforce 

### On implementation

Long-term it makes sense 
Crypto payouts. Perhaps via a Stablecoin to minimize external volatility.

Should probably build on top of: https://blog.variant.fund/world-network-opportunity-greenfield-builders. - need to study what Worldcoin actually is.
