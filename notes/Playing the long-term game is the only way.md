Linear, Substack, Vercel, Mercury, etc. have been consistently shipping for such a long period of time. And finally, their products have achieved a sort of quality milestone: high quality and spread across multiple product categories to offer a comprehensive one-stop solution.

It It took them many years to get there. Almost a decade. This is the kind of committed execution that's required to create a category-defining company. It takes consistent, persistent, long-term effort in a single direction (mission).

I see Farcaster take the same patient approach. I'm excited to see what they build. And ofc Perplexity is on that track as well, but will need to wait a couple more years to see how they turn out (though I'm quite bullish).
