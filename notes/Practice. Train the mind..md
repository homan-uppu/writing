Every single thing you need is right here:
- pollution free environment close to nature.
- great setup to do great work: desk, monitor, fast internet, comfortable chair, great mic and cam (phone) to be able to put yourself out there the way you want to.
- the space to explore within yourself: you can build an exceptionally strong practice here and ascend the mind.
- excellent filmmaking talent and studios close by that can help you make videos.
- you can hire a writing editor remotely.
- international connectivity: 40 min drive to an airport that can take you anywhere in the world - whether for short vacations or long trips.
- healthy food cooked for you by a loving fam.

what more could you want? this is more than what you need. i'm so damn grateful.

all that you need to do is take action and channel the states of mind that enable you to make the most of these resources you have access to.

if you can't create a system that works well here, you can't do it anywhere else. that's the crux.
