By fraud, I mean any kind of manipulation / deception with the intention to profit.

As discussed above, **investor confidence is critical for the Network to survive**. If investors feel that there's too much fraud on the network, or feel like they don't have a good recourse if they’re scammed, they far less likely to invest in personal tokens.

Fraud could be:
- **Identity fraud**: A user who has already created a personal token and raised money in the past creates another personal token on the Network in order to raise more money while hiding their history. This is something that a user who has already raised capital and has consistently failed to create any value would want to do to cover up their poor track record.
- [Rug pulls](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/tips-and-tutorials/what-is-a-rug-pull-and-how-to-avoid-it): a user raising capital by fabricating a pitch without actually having the intention to create long-term value. They raise money and aren’t seen again.
- **Avoiding capital gains distribution**: A user, after raising capital (and therefore has investors who own some equity in their personal token), intentionally fails to report selling company equity (outside of the Network) in order to avoid having to pay their investors their proportional share of the capital gained from the equity sale.




In order to make sure that a user can only have one personal token and can't hide their track record from investors, the Network will need to verify the human behind the user: via government ID verification, or perhaps by taking advantage of something like [WorldID](https://world.org/world-id).

In order to prevent rug pulls, it would help to have the backing of courts. This requires treating personal tokens as securities and complying with the regulations around securities. In cases of fraud, investors (or the Network’s legal counsel) can then file lawsuits under federal securities laws ([particularly Rule 10b-5](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rule10b5.asp)) for material misrepresentations or omissions made during fundraising. In the early stages, to minimize legal complexity, restricting the Network to only users in the US makes the most sense because of its ambitious talent pool and quality of investors.

To prevent avoiding capital gains distribution, the Network could require users who have shareholders in their personal tokens to submit their tax returns annually (which would reflect any capital gains).

Yet, prevention is far more valuable than cure. Having a strong community of high quality, ambitious users who genuinely want to do great work is critically important. Ambitious individuals operate on long time horizons and wouldn’t want to damage their reputation for some measly short-term gains. Therefore, the Network will need to be able to penalize bad actors such that they can’t participate in the Network.

Investors who believe they’ve been scammed can flag it and the fundraise will be investigated by the fraud authority: a team that works for the Network that is responsible for identifying fraud and taking measures to penalize bad actors.

Assessing whether fraud actually took place can be difficult. In order to have sufficient information to assess claims, it would help to encourage personal token owners and their shareholders to communicate within the Network itself, so that in the case that someone claims fraud, the Network’s fraud authority can inspect the communication between the parties, do research in the real world to validate claims, and come to a decision on whether it believes fraud took place and to what degree.

When this authority decides someone is a bad actor, they can freeze the bad actor’s personal token on Network, and the bad actor would be barred from participating in the future.

Blocked users should have a way to challenge decisions. When this happens, the evidence and argument produced by the fraud authority would be shared to a sufficient number of Network users who could vote on whether fraud actually took place (and thereby whether the user can be let back in or not).

Centralization (with a decentralized means to correct mistakes) is required in the early days in order to swiftly block bad actors so that they don’t do more damage to the Network. As artificial intelligence becomes more powerful, this function can be more decentralized: i.e. instead of giving a small group of people power, Network users instead vote on the prompts & examples taught to the AI to determine what is fraud on the network and what isn’t. Therefore, **I predict degree of decentralization to be proportional to the degree of intelligence of AI.**

We could also introduce a voting system to determine who is a part of this fraud authority. This will be important because there can (and will likely be) bad actors in the fraud team as well.
