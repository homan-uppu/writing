This is such an important lesson for someone like me. If you just play the simple game well, and just keep at it without worrying about what the world thinks about you, you're going to end up doing pretty darn well.

The biggest challenge for you is to insulate your own mind from comparison. To be satisfied in just plowing along on the path that you've chosen without comparison, worry, or over-anxiety. Just keep chugging along.

I now just want to quiet compound.
