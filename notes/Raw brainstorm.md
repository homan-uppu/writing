- Intention lacks force, as a result quite difficult to execute on any long-term plan. My first priority ought to be to build back up this force. To create a personal system, and to stick to it come what may.
- Text to graph. Presenting data really neatly. Well. This one could be interesting.
- Make and publish a video. Make it high quality, and get a feel for the process.

Lean into the Stable Diffusion creator world, and get a feel for it. Just get a sense for where the technology is at: how it works under the hood (i.e. how are these models trained), what is the rate of progress, what's the cutting edge that's possible with it, etc. Just play with it. Without any preconceived notions about what will come out of it. Just have... fun. For the first time in years, just fucking have fun. Absolutely.

Process would be quite simple:
- One "learning doc" to keep track of all the things that are going on.
- See what people are able to create.
- Start messing around with creating as well. Ofc, only things that you find useful / interesting.

If you can do this from a place of fun, and consistently, then everything else will take care of itself.

But, you absolutely have to find that fun. If it's not fun, you're not going to come out of this rut. And if you don't come out of this rut, your mind isn't going to be well enough to be able to create anything. An all round problem.

Just play. Seriously.
