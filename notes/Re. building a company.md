There are so many distractions. Social media is mostly a distraction. Looking at competition is a distraction. Everything other than thinking about the problem, building, shipping, and talking to users, and building / managing a team that aids in this process, is a distraction.

Directly approach the Truth. Doing anything else is a complete, utter, distraction.

You know what would be incredible? A software builder with world class UI/UX defaults. That would be absolutely dope. 

Can we go more primitive? Give a set of building blocks to enable creation.

How do you aid learning?
OK, think differently: what would you want to ace this phase really well? A tool to help me think well. Amen.

Don't fall into the short term thinking trap. Be long term oriented.
I don't feel there's anything to "create" in the short-term. I guess I just have to keep writing? I'm not sure how I feel about this. I'm not in a state of mind to create. The mind is compromised. I'm craving to disconnect from literally everything. Take a step back. And train my mind.

Writing is literally all there is to be done at the moment. Write to understand. With understanding and engaging with others, eventually, maybe, a meaningful angle will open up. But, you can't force it. That's the crux. You can't force it.

You can't force it. You can only sit patiently and do the work. Without any inputs from the world. Just do the work.

Just do the work.
