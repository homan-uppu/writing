What does it mean to be "political"?
- Internal politics vs. discussing "politics" the external thing (i.e. elections, voting, etc.).
- The best definition: anything that doesn't optimize for getting the results you want.
- (Yeah, it's important to define this really well).

**Examples**:
- My Salesforce experience.
- Pallavi's Harvard group thing - which is quite hilarious but is something that happens in almost every large group. ICGT, AIO, Tedx Georgia Tech organizing committee, group projects, companies, etc.
- There's a strong pull in all of us to be political. It's our natural instinct.
- Becoming political is a natural outcome of any organization. Absolutely any organization - including "spiritual" or any organization.
- People constantly jostle for power, and look to influence how the group functions - either directly, or indirectly.
- People form alliances, divide themselves into groups, operate to gain the favor of a particular group, etc.

**Downsides**:
- It often distracts from getting real work done. Look at Google. Politics taken to the extreme results in people posturing for approval & support.
- Incentives become warped: forming alliances, getting approval from the right person is more important than pushing the organization to actually create the value they set out to do.

**How to minimize politics**.
- Acknowledge that you're fighting against natural human tendencies.
- Politics also seems to be exacerbated when companies over-hire. When there's not enough work for people, they start playing political games - because we're restless by nature and can't sit around doing nothing, so we conjure up social games to play. Politics. So perpetually keeping the team smaller than what's "required" is probably a good strategy to keep politics to a minimum.
 - Strong culture in which everyone's responsibilities are extremely clear.

"In the background, there was a game-of-thrones political war raging within the ranks of upper management in the infrastructure engineering organization. It seemed like every manager was fighting their peers and attempting to undermine their direct supervisor so that they could have their direct supervisor's job. No attempts were made by these managers to hide what they were doing: they boasted about it in meetings, told their direct reports about it, and the like. I remember countless meetings with my managers and skip-levels where I would sit there, not saying anything, and the manager would be boasting about finding favor with their skip-level and that I should expect them to have their manager's job within a quarter or two. I also remember a very disturbing team meeting in which one of the directors boasted to our team that he had withheld business-critical information from one of the executives so that he could curry favor with one of the other executives (and, he told us with a smile on his face, it worked!).

The ramifications of these political games were significant: projects were abandoned left and right, OKRs were changed multiple times each quarter, nobody knew what our organizational priorities would be one day to the next, and very little ever got done. We all lived under fear that our teams would be dissolved, there would be another re-org, and we'd have to start on yet another new project with an impossible deadline. It was an organization in complete, unrelenting chaos." - Uber during 2015 - 2017 (and this environment likely existed well after this account).

-> This is an example of a company succeeding despite the internal politics. And so I think people assume that politics is fine since it exists in successful companies. Which is an interesting point.

-> Perhaps politics is a natural byproduct of some success. With some success, your company becomes more popular, and the MBA types start flocking to it.

-> Also, there is the kind of person who's primary skillset is politics. That's all it is. And I've seen them get quite far because they know how to create and play the political game really damn well. So I'm not here to say 
	- Yeah, this is a good point: being political can enable you to build a "stable" career. For sure. But I don't think it'll take you to great heights. Why? Because at the end of the day, you have to be able to actually get something done. We remember, and applaud those that do, not those that posture. History is full of "middle manager" type people that only played politics. We usually don't hear about them.
	- And if a company is successful, then in the early days at least I'd bet they weren't that political.

-> The antidote to politics seems to be the need to actually get shit done. 

But I think generally it's helpful to try and join a non-political organization because:
1. You learn the skills that actually matter.
2. Work is about work. Creating value is challenging and can require hard work, but politics can wear you down unless you're ready for that game - which is often a completely different game than doing actual work.

-> I really liked Brain Armstrong's message to employees to not mix politics with work.
