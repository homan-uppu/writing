If a user acts fraudulently, their reputation should be negatively impacted.

What would a good reputation system look like?

A good reputation system would have a sufficiently granular measure of reputation, perhaps as a score out of 100, to be able to represent the subtle differences between different kinds of fraud.

A good reputation system swiftly uncovers gaps between what a user claims is true and reality.

A good reputation system would have a rubric that correctly penalizes a misrepresentation proportional to how damaging it is to the health of the Network. For example: raising capital and running with it instead of doing what you said you would when you pitch yourself is an action that could greatly erode trust in the Network. On the other hand, failing to report capital gains from selling equity in a company (out of the Network) is far less damaging. These actions should not be penalized equally.

A good reputation system would interpret the rubric accurately for each case. Any good rubric will have room for interpretation so that it can generalize to many different scenarios. A good reputation system would apply the rubric consistently across cases.

A good reputation system would make a user's reputation score available to all who may want to work with them, to enable users to make more informed decisions.

A good reputation system would have a fair way to challenge decisions that impacted a user's reputation score.

A good reputation system would be sufficiently decentralized to minimize the impact of the biases (which are bound to exist, as well as grow over time) of a single authority.

Implementing such a reputation system is a massive undertaking in and of itself. Fortunately, we'll only need a small subset of features to be able to successfully launch the Network, while leaving the design and implementation of a full-fledged reputation system for later - when the Network is more mature.

At launch, I propose the following system: any user in the Network can flag fraudulent activity, and a centralized reputation authority would assess the claim. If it sees merit in it, the authority would ban the bad actor from the Network.
