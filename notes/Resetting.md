Not a great day for the mind. Not feeling at the top of my game. Agitation. Disillusionment. The problem is entirely internal.

The first problem is in my diet. I need to get back to OMAD ASAP. That is the foundation for the good life. No more eating today. Going to sleep without consuming another calorie.

How am I going to do this?
1. Get the diet back under control. This is the foundation.
2. Curb caffeine - overconsumption leads to unnecessary crashes. Don't hijack the natural dopamine system.
3. Cut out content consumption. This is straight poison.
4. Sit a lot more than you feel you should.

Maintain this. It will take a few days to reset. There is no other path.
