0. The practice. Including the strict Sila. Build the concentration of the mind.
1. I must get back to a strict one meal a day. This must stick this time around. Extra food impacts the mind in serious ways.
2. Cook your own food from here on out. Make the same exact meal every single day, and eat it at the same time every single day. I want to build this skill before I head out.
3. Add back in the **Ashtanga yoga** practice on a daily basis. And add in workouts to engage the core and help with your posture.

Make this the primary focus for now. Only when you get back to the right fasting, and the practice, will you have the ability to tackle the other aspects of life.
