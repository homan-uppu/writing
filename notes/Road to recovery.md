1. Going to **ramp up meditation significantly**. Study the self. Study the mind. Study your agitation. And build ease towards it. You need a baseline foundation before you're even ready to tackle deeper dives into the mind.
2. Strict one meal a day. No changes to this plan whatsoever. Don't eat until 7pm today. Get the workout in at 6pm (Ashtanga).
3. There is no more figuring out any steps. You just have to write. That is all you have to do. No more distractions. Just write.
