The world's ambition capital.
The home for the ambitious.
My home.

Any team that I build will be in person in San Francisco. There is no other place in the world that can support a highly ambitious team as well as SF.

I'm going to slowly, but surely, find my way back to that city - when it's time: i.e. when the city pulls me back to it through my work. I'm not going to force it. I'll only go when I'm naturally drawn into it.
