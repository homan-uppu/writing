i'm 100% clear about wanting my own creative studio to operate out of, that i have complete control over (i.e. no one can visit when i don't want them to, etc.).

my mind is getting quite distracted by this, so i'm going to put some thought into this right now. if i decide BLR is the right place, i'm going to leave tonight itself, if Hyd is it, i'm going to go finalize a place first thing in the morning - and will continue work once i move in there.

**non-negotiable: i'm moving out of this home - a few hours at the earliest, a couple of days at the latest. this is certain.** ... and i'm not going to get back to work until i'm in MY space. this is an important commitment for me. i'm going to see it through because i see no other way.

**reasons to stay in HYD:**
- financially better: cheaper rent, much lower deposit, no need to invest in a great desk set up and monitor.
	- this monitor & desk set up is actually a **huge productivity boost**. i really like working with this setup. to replicate it, you'll need to spend 1.5L. that's a lot, so what you'll do is you'll avoid it, and therefore incur a productivity hit. i don't want any sort of productivity hit in my work set up. i can handle it in other things, but i want my work set up to inspire me to come do great work and support a healthy working posture.
	- deposit is very nominal in Hyd - basically 1 - 2 months of rent which is solid esp since i'm likely going to move at a moment's notice.
- you don't have to fly anywhere and waste the few days to get set up in a new place.
- this is not the phase for any kind of socialization, therefore, the social advantage of BLR (which is huge btw) isn't worth it. i need to just lock in and execute. that's all that matters. it's basically time for a v. serious monk mode.
- come meet fambam when you feel like it - maybe once every week, or even every day if you live close enough (to eat lunch or something).
- burn is quite reasonable:
	- 20 - 30k rent.
	- 3k internet.
	- (and that's it if you live close enough to home to come home for the meal).

concerns about HYD:
- **the isolation might get to me**. i have to be a lot more intentional about getting out and meeting people in person, and also connecting with people online. this is an incredibly important skill i must hone.

**reasons to move to BLR**
- strong yogasana practice at the Shala. you will be forced to go every day - and this is an incredibly powerful foundation for a healthy life.
- stronger social scene:
	- interact with Gururaja at the Yoga shala and potentially other students
	- coffee / grind sessions with Naren every now and then (or just a general hang out once a week).el
	- challenge yourself to meet someone new every day / at least once a week. rebuild the social muscle.
- solid food eating out (Go Native Thali and you're set).

concerns about BLR:
- more expensive. burn will be up to 70k / mo. for the lifestyle that i'm looking for:
	- 25k rent
	- 3k internet
	- 3k water cans
	- 3k yoga fees
	- 30k food and drinks (cup of solid coffee and maybe tea later on).
	- 5k misc.
