Bro, honestly, all that's remaining is the grind. Everything else is pretty fucking clear. All you need to do is grind.

### Ideal work setup
I have everything I need. I literally don't need anything more. This is the truth. Just set up your monitor - would help as you iterate on design. Take the occasional drive to a cafe from Mokila to do a few hours pen and paper exploration. You have absolutely everything you need.

Don't over-invest in this. Use the cheap-ish chairs you have access to. Don't worry about all that jazz. Fasting + yoga + strength training will keep your back quite healthy. The chairs you have are fine.
### Mokila vs. DD Colony

*Reasons for Mokila:*
1. Morning practice with Dad. Knowing he's up pushes me to get up and maintain that schedule.
2. Much healthier food. Don't have to eat crap (though I can arrange that here with Lakshmi as well). - but still, I like Amma's cooking much better.
3. Spacious upper floor to use as an office space. Can keep all electronics and internet outside of the area where I sleep. Meditation space is separate from where I sleep and work. I can have a separate space for each activity - I think that's quite beneficial.
4. Spend time with fam - morning tea time.
5. Can work out of a cafe for a few hours every day. Come back home for another sesh, Yoga, dinner, and an evening sesh. You could even do this a couple of days a week - not an issue. Would be nice to get out of the house every now and then to grind.
6. Cut out the rent and other expenses (this is actually a non-problem because the point is that )
7. Can invest in physical things knowing that they'll never need to be moved (except the street down). Basically, can build a more "permanent" work set up that will last for as long as I want to grind there.

*Reasons to stay in DD colony*
- Strong infrastructure. But will need to rent out another apartment, OR stay at Thatha's and come here to work. The sleeping, working, sitting in the same place is really killing the vibe. But the "vibe" is purely internal. You should be able to overcome it by sitting more. It's an internal game. You can play it as well as you want.
- Meeting Thatha every day would really help him (and me) out. I have an opportunity to invest in a relationship in a way that I've never had the chance to before. That would actually be quite beneficial tbh. But I have a similar opportunity / responsibility to spend time with parents - who I have a deeper sense of responsibility towards.

*Decision:* I'm going to move to Mokila. I'm going to create a setup there that's going to be absolutely solid. I'm going to make that space my own. I'm going to commit to the area and the direction that I'm working on. I'm not going to give up on this (it's a direction that keeps coming back to me starting all the way back in 2015, but the timing really is NOW - LLMs are required to build the best feed. They are required to scale intuition).
