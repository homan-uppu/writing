This whole writing journey started with seeking truth. Let's come back to it and write that essay that I was working on.

There are many angles and topics related to seeking truth. The first step would be to list them all out to make sense of, and to really comprehend, what it means to seek truth and why it matters to us (i.e. it's the most important collective skill as well).

Explain what seeking truth means. And then quickly shift focus to the kinds of tools and systems that enable us to be better at seeking truth. What is knowledge? How can we organize and access knowledge in powerful ways.

This is simultaneously a concept, philosophy and product exploration. Make sense of this concept from all angles. Find the way to attack it. The attack is important. Can't sit around and idly just brainstorm forever. Be more productive in how you seek truth.
