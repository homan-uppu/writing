Why are our activities are more complex than Chess & Go? The most complex human activities are the ones that involve people and how they feel.

Human feeling is more complex than Chess & Go because it is far more difficult to describe its state. A system that has a much more complicated state has more possibilities and is therefore more complex.

Recall when you had to communicate how you felt. You'll remember how difficult it is to do so, and importantly that no matter how many words you use, you weren't able to fully, completely, communicate what you felt. Translating a feeling into words is difficult because we are trying to represent something of a higher complexity into a medium that cannot capture that complexity fully. Information is lost in translation.

This lost information is precisely what allows for the various interpretations of words. Every single person reading this will feel different feelings. Even though my intention is to make you feel what I feel about this topic, there is absolutely no way for me to do so without any loss of information, no matter what medium I use: words, images, videos, symbols, etc. - even if I spend my entire life trying. I believe this gap between the complexity of human feeling and the mediums we use to communicate feeling is massive. <FootnoteReference number={3} />

Chess and Go can easily be represented by symbols (text, pictures, etc.), and therefore are much simpler than solving for people. As we gain leverage, our activities move closer to directly solving for people.

A century ago ago, workers would assemble physical things in a factory and wouldn't need to think too much about people. Workers today are now more involved in building products and services that require them to understand people and their problems more directly.

Programmers are being asked to become better at thinking about what to build and understanding users, [without just thinking about how to build something](https://x.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1637087219591659520). Animators are being asked to contribute something meaningful to the story instead of only translating a rough sketch into a completed animation. Pizza cooks, and ice cream store employees, are all being asked to tell engaging stories on social media to attract more customers.

***Everyone is moving towards solving for people.***

Artists for thousands of years have been solving for how to make people feel. Which is why it's no surprise that the arts have always had extreme inequality in ability. Human progress is pushing us all towards the games that artists have been playing for a long time, and also towards the intense inequality in outcomes that artists have felt for a long time.
