I want to make this essay absolutely incredible. The best essay I have ever written - both in terms of quality of explanation, but also in the images, diagrams that I use, and also the overall presentation. It needs to ooze of incredible quality. those reading, from the get to, should feel like they're reading something special: something that the author spent a lot of care and hard work to create.

I also want feedback from at least 5 people who's great at writing / who's opinions I deeply respect. Who I don't know personally (will reach them via cold outreach). Also consider paying a great writer for feedback (nah - if they're accepting money for feedback, they're probably not that great). There are some great writers in Tech that I respect. Track them and your communications with them in a DB.

And embrace the grind brother. This is what it takes.

Don't get ahead of yourself. Focus on what matters. Focus on seeking truth. The results will come when they may. That is not your job. Your job is to work hard, and earnestly. That is all that is in your hands.
