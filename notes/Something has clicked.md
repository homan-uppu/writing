I see no other path. Let's see where this path takes me. I just can't see doing anything else. Absolutely nothing else makes sense.

I need to go inwards.

Everything I'm doing feels forced. My mind isn't cooperating. There's no shame in retreating in order to strike back. Ofc, this retreat will be brutally difficult - the most difficult thing I have done.
