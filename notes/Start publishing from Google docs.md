Get traction on the ideas first before sinking time into the presentation layer.
Just Google docs the crap out of it.

Get traction on the Google doc itself. This is a great starting point esp when reaching out to people cold because the https://docs.google is a safe, trusted domain to click. And getting feedback on the draft itself allows you to garner support for this idea before you publish widely such that they can help amplify the post.

This is a solid way to go about things. Keep your entire writing on Google docs (including your "website" which will basically be a doc w/ a bio and links to your essay drafts).

This is actually an excellent approach. And it ensures that I can grind hard with really crappy internet. In fact, the lack of a strong internet connection is NOT a blocker whatsoever. My mind is the only blocker for me.
