I take an oath that from 9/4/2023, I shall only eat one meal a day unless there is a strong medical reason not to do so (and even in that situation I promise to revert back to OMAD as soon as possible).

I'm done poisoning my body with more food than it needs, sending it into a metabolic syndrome.

I need to become a lot thinner. I need to drop at least 10kg. I don't need that much muscle, just enough to do my Ashtanga practice and that's about it.

Make this strong promise to yourself, and don't deviate at all. Amen.
