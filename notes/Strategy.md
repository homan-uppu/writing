Do not get distracted. There is a clear path in front of you. You must walk it. There is no other way.

I want to optimize for when I can start outreach. This is the only way to get in front of the people that I care about - until I have greater leverage (when people will start to come to me). In other words, I need a "product" that is worth reaching out with. That is the crux.

The product in this case is writing. I'm going to write something that is incredibly valuable, that paints a vision of the future and how we will get there. And then I'm going to execute on it.

Embrace the solitude for this phase. There is no way around it until you break through. You need a solid product in order to have a fruitful outreach. And you can craft such a product with time and effort. You must. Have no craving for the results. Focus on the quality of your thinking, and deliver.

This will take serious effort and discipline. I'm not going to waver from this writing path until I feel that I've fleshed out my worldview, and it's time to act on it. I'm not going to budge. This is when stubbornness is required. The strong determination. Grasping power. Amen.
