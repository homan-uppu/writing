By decentralization, I mean decentralization of power: distributing power to many, as opposed to concentrating power in the hands of few.

Naturally, there's a notion of "degree": the more decentralized a network of people is, the more individuals the power is distributed to, and the more evenly it's distributed.

Examples of decentralization of varying degrees:
- Dictatorship < representative democracy < individual democracy (every decision voted on by everyone).
- Social platform with one feed algorithm < Social platform with a marketplace of third party feed algorithms < social platform in which each user can create their own algorithm by training their own AI model.
- One centralized bank that controls all transactions < multiple competing banks < peer to peer transactions without an intermediary.

Unfortunately, in Tech circles, due to the hype surrounding crypto / web3 projects, people assume decentralization to just mean slapping everything onto a blockchain and calling it a day. Decentralization is a theme that is much broader than any specific piece of technology, and has been a growing trend for centuries.

Before we explore the pros and cons of decentralization and why it makes sense to build the Network in a decentralized way, it would help to understand what decentralization looks like in the context of the Network of personal tokens so that we can ground our discussion in the practical impact on our Network, rather than have it be a philosophical discussion.

#### Decentralization in the context of the Network:

**1. Decentralized ownership of personal tokens**: at the core of the Network is information about personal tokens: who owns how much of which token. Transacting equity in personal tokens is essentially just manipulating this ledger. By making this ledger decentralized, there is no centralized source of truth that can be easily manipulated by a third party.

**2. Decentralized admissions**: instead of a centralized authority determining who can get into the Network and benefit from it, that power is decentralized in the hands of the many investors: if you can successfully raise capital by selling equity in your personal token, you are officially an active participant in the Network. There isn't a singular notion / criteria for what makes someone investable, but rather many competing notions.

**3. Decentralized reputation system**. As discussed earlier, a reputation system must:
1. Uncover gaps between claims & reality.
2. Rubric to determine the degree of severity of a fraudulent action.
3. Consistently interpret & apply that rubric for specific cases.

A decentralized reputation system would have a distributed means to uncover lies (e.g. like a community notes system), multiple rubrics to select from, and multiple ways to interpret rubrics. Users can propose their own reputation systems and publish on an open market. As soon as a user "activates" a reputation system, it scores everyone in the Network according to its specific design. The reputation system that most people select over time will become the most popular and "de-facto" reputation system. And if users decide another one is better, they can switch to it.

**4. Decentralized discovery**: instead of a single algorithm (/ model) to match investors and individuals to invest in, anyone can create and publish their own algorithm that others can use.

#### Why decentralize?

A decentralized network is easier for users to trust, and enables the network to better evolve to match the growing needs of its users in ways that the builders of the network can't even imagine. I predict that with sufficient time, no system: whether nation, social platform, financial system, etc. will last unless it becomes sufficiently decentralized: distributing power among its users, and protecting that distribution through technology, without requiring users to have to rely on a fallible authority.

Therefore, in order for the Network to stand the test of time and last for centuries, it must be designed to be sufficiently decentralized at its core, and evolve to be more decentralized over time. As discussed earlier, opportunity will not be democratized overnight. It will take time. The Network must last.

A decentralized representation of ownership in personal tokens builds trust: it's not easy for someone (say an individual, or company, or even government) to manipulate your ownership in personal tokens without your permission.

Decentralization encourages people to build on top of the Network because they don't feel like they're building on someone else's land that can be snatched away from them anytime. 

For example, an application built on the Network could allow users to form "collectives" which invest in personal tokens together. Future educational institutions, and mentorship programs could be created as collectives on the network with the teachers, and perhaps even alumni, investing together in every new student they accept.

Similarly, there are many potential, useful, applications that can be built on a decentralized personal token network that we can't even imagine right now - in the same way that the early creators of the internet couldn't imagine the rich possibilities that could be created on top of the internet. Therefore, building a network in a decentralized way is also a form of accepting that our imaginations are limited and that we need the help of users and third party creators to build on top of the network in order for the network to best serve its users.

#### Optimal decentralization

Decentralization has a cost:
1. Less efficient in the early days. A centralized authority can make decisions more swiftly.
2. Can be less secure: when a transaction is irreversible by a centralized authority, individuals must be more careful because you can't simply reverse the transaction / easily recover stolen assets like how you can do with the [chargeback system](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chargeback.asp) with traditional financial transactions.
3. Takes more time to design, build, and iterate on.

What is the optimal amount of decentralization, and which factors determine optimality?

Decentralize too quickly and you end up with a system that makes it more difficult to get traction and grow. Decentralize too slow and you will be outcompeted by a more decentralized network. (E.g. the US attracted many of the greatest talents in the world by being a more decentralized, free nation). It's a balancing act.

I propose that in the early days of the Network, the ledger that keeps track of ownerships in personal tokens is decentralized (maintained on a blockchain), while the reputation system that tackles fraud be centralized in the hands of the core team. Building a decentralized reputation system requires a sufficient number of users and transactions on the Network which we will not have in the beginning.

This will allow us to ship the Network quickly, gain initial traction and then start to decentralize the Network more as the Network becomes more mature.
