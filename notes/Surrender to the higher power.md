Surrender to the incentives.

Surrender to the higher power that is working through you.

Silence your mind, so that the subtler mind can work without inhibition.

"Raagame yogamu ani" - similarly, your work is your Yoga: the process of union with Nature. Work is your worship. There is no higher calling.

Accept everything that higher power throws your way with a smile.

Work from a state of surrender, not action. Let the actions come to you through surrendering, not by reaching for them.
