### Struggle
*An artist ferociously scribbling. Tearing it up. Trying again. Camera slow zoom into the tense face of the artist. A tear rolling down.*
The artist's struggle is not to create.
It's to not get in the way of the creation.

### Creation
*In sheer frustration, he throws his head down on the desk.*
When the creation arrives, it illuminates.
The ego, starved, craves to show off the light.
Yet, when the ego grasps, the creation disappears.

### Witness
The artist's struggle is to be a witness.
To create without being the creator.
To do without doing.
To surrender.
