A key functionality of personal tokens is capital gains distribution to personal token shareholders when the personal token owner sells their equity in other personal tokens / companies - proportional to how much equity the shareholder holds.

This distribution of capital gains happens immediately when the equity sold is in a personal token because the capital gains happens within the Network itself, therefore the distribution can happen automatically (programmatically - whenever equity in a personal token is sold - the capital to be distributed to shareholders goes directly into their wallets, it never even reaches the personal token owner).

But, we need a way to know when equity in companies is sold by a personal token owner who has shareholders because this transaction happens out of the Network.

If a user is early in their career and may want to raise more capital in the future (by selling more equity in their personal token), they are incentivized to accurately report capital gains out of the Network because it strengthens their pitch for their future fundraising round: in addition to showing how their valuation increased, they can also point to how much money they earned their shareholders since their last round of fundraising.

Yet, users who don't plan to raise capital in the future have an incentive to conveniently forget reporting off Network capital gains to avoid having to pay some of it to their shareholders.

Today, it doesn't look like there's no direct way for the Network to access this information (individuals and their equities in companies) because it's not public information. But, there still may be some ways to do so, such as: requiring users who have shareholders in their personal tokens to submit their annual tax returns - specifically the Schedule D / form 8948 which has information about how much equity was sold from which companies, for how much. Or perhaps connecting with the platforms that hold this information (such as Angellist, etc.).

But, these approaches aren't "clean" so to speak: they still rely on individuals reporting information, which is difficult to rely on.

In the long-run, the Network should aim to be the de-facto source of truth for equity in companies as well in order to eliminate relying on self-reporting by individuals. I have no good ideas how to approach this in the short-term, but I predict that there will be some ways to make this happen as the Network matures and reaches a critical mass in number of users and market capitalization.
