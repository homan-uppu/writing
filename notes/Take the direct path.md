Take the most direct path to creating the change you want in the world. The absolute most direct path. This is where you need to prioritize incredibly well.

Think this through before getting back to the essay because this will determine how you publish it, to who, and what you do next.

*Beliefs that have changed:*
1. I need far less feedback than I thought. What's more important is finding the right people, not convincing anyone of anything. My writing is simply a search function. I don't believe my argument is off in any major way.
2. I need to craft the shortest path to identifying the implementation of these ideas.

What is the direct path?

Done
- Fear equality (how the world is changing and where our intuitions are off).

Next?
- There is no room for average. (as asymmetry rises, the average will not have any room)
- Solve for feeling. (Hierarchy of complexity)
- Depth is breadth.
