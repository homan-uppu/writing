The belief that AI will reduce the cost of education is misplaced. AI will only increase the cost of the sort of education that actually makes a difference in outcomes.

The more complex (and therefore creative) a skill is, the more difficult it is to become great at it, and the more difficult it is to teach it. Many adults can teach high school math reasonably well. Very few can teach how to build great companies, write well enough to make a living from it, make films, etc. because these skills are far more complex.

In addition, as the power law becomes more skewed, the value of becoming one of the best skyrockets. Any teacher that improves chances of becoming one of the best at what you do becomes that much more valuable.

AI and more content will make great knowledge accessible. But, _personalized feedback_ that gives you significant advantage over just consuming generalized content will be worth a lot more. As the number of teachers who are good enough shrinks (just as the number who are good enough at the skill will shrink as the power law becomes more skewed), their time will be worth a lot more.

talk about how making education free won't work as a result. yeah, this needs to be addressed right here bec it's the most obvious, important counterargument to counter.
