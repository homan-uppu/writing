I think I've underestimated just how bad large teams (and therefore companies) are at what they do. 



---
- Teams start strong and eventually collapse.
- What causes the rapid degradation?
- Lagging indicator of team quality and revenue (when things go well). Outward success masks internal rot.
- Employee number 100 is significantly different from employee number 1. And same from 100 - 1000. Add a 0, and divide quality by 2.
