- *Quality of execution* is critical. The "feeling" is just as important as the "value". They are more tightly coupled than it seems. I'm OK with taking twice as long for a much superior quality output. Quality compounds ridiculously in the long run. Don't sacrifice it at any step in the process. The product experience must be exceptional. World class. The best that anyone anywhere could produce.
- *Communication* is key. Simple. Clear. Lucid. Must flow like the Ganga. High knowledge density. Efficient. Nothing unnecessary. Heavily edited, yet feels natural. That's the deadly combination. Own your communication: build your own audience. Speak through your own profiles. Don't allow someone else to control the editing and publishing of what you say. Control the channel between you and the audience.
- *Transparent*. I'm going to put as much of my thinking into the world as I can. I'm not going to worry about copycats. The primary goal of sharing is to attract collaborators. Building the right team is 99.99% of the battle.
- *Experimental*. Everything is just an experiment. Everything except for the core mission is reversible. Be willing to wipe the slate and start over. Over & over again until you've found The Way.
