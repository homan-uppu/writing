he grew up in a much more difficult time. if you took a risk and failed, you'd likely have to eat shit for the rest of your life (and you'd drag down your family with you).

his risk-averseness is rooted in the pain of failure. when an entire family branch depends on you for their wellbeing, you can't afford to take risks.

but, because of his sacrifices, i have the opportunity to take great risks, and take risks i shall! i view it as my responsibility to take great risks that others are unable to, which in turn has a chance of pushing the world forward in a substantial way.

every single person that came before me contributed in some sense to my ability to execute today. this is a collective game. we're all on the same time. every effort that we put forth today will help individuals many generations down the line. every little bit of effort counts.

In yesterday's conversation with fam, I realized how much Thatha prioritized people - i.e. he had a deep intention to build and uplift community. That was a common undercurrent, and theme, throughout his life.

Which is also why this period of isolation has taken such a big toll on him.

I respect the way he lived his life. For sure.
