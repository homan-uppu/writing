Some seem to think that AI, decentralization, remote work, etc. power will shift power away from the US. New technology only amplifies America's advantage: a culture that supports the crazy & ambitious of the world. The US will be stupidly far ahead by the end of this decade.

Only the weirdly ambitious know how rare such a culture is because they're extra sensitive to cultures that don't support their ambition. They will continue to arrive on America's shores in droves.

The H1B bottleneck isn't as big of a problem as it may seem because most of them aren't ambitious. We need to ensure that those with great talent and ambitious ideas have a red carpet entry into the US. We're far from where we need to be.

The government is terrible at picking who has potential and who doesn't. Their criteria are too easy to game. The problem isn't that they're letting in average talent who gamed the system, but that they might be missing out on the greatest, most ambitious talent.

Most VC's who spend their lives trying to pick winners have terrible outcomes. It's not easy. The government is bound to be more terrible. By orders of magnitude.
