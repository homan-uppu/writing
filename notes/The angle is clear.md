I'm going to build a company at the intersection of AI and learning. 100%. The more I write, the more clear this is becoming. Wow.

A multi-modal attack to bridge the skill gap. This will require content, AI, products, community, everything.

This will be a 20 year project. Trust the process. Seek truth. Write.
