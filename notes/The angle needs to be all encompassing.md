I need to be able to literally embody the direction. I should be able to create content for it. I need to have the inner passion flow through me as I express myself through this product.

Actually, this angle is fixed. This is stupidly clear.

Fight fire with fire. Fight the algorithms that don't have your best interests in mind with those that do. We will arm you with the weapon that will protect your mind from being weaponized.

Don't overthink this. Don't see too far into the future. Build what works now, for yourself. And then think about it.
