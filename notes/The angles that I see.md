Sales driven
- A product for startups: 
	- The internal AI agents angle. An LLM client for fast moving startups.
	- Information consumption for founders.
- Indian lawyer copilot - target Rohit age group with a stellar product experience that is 100x Manupatra (which seems to be the status quo).
	- Can completely bootstrap this and eventually grow to some of the larger law firms in the country.

Consumer-ish
- **Attention copilot**: target internet addicts like myself and help them regain control over what goes into their minds. - Get through the design process first.
- A domain specific agent.

Approaches:
1. Curb ambition and go hard on a clearly winnable angle - aggressively sales driven. Should able to get to a few mil ARR in a couple of years. Don't even look at what the startup community is up to. Engage directly with the Truth. - Targeting India will restrict you, but this is also the space that is the most ripe for an aggressive sales approach that will convert in the short term. The starting point is conversations with dozens of lawyers.
2. Build for the decade. Take a problem and see it the fuck through.
3. No strings attached experiments. Products that you'd use. Shipped to yourself first, and then to the world.
