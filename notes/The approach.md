There are many ways to go about this.
What's most important is building a rhythm, actually shipping, and seeing things through.
### Mind
Managing the mind will be the most important challenge during this process. Why? Because only you can stop yourself on this path. You cannot follow the moods of the mind. That will lead you to hell.
### Physical health
1. One meal a day. In the evening.
2. Ashtanga primary series / long run.
### Building + writing.
Writing is thinking. You need great thinking in order to take the right paths.
