Paying to learn will no longer be an economically viable strategy for most because the gap in productivity between the best and the average is growing rapidly - leading to a world in which winners-take-most. If you’re not one of the best (in something that the world values) you will not be able to contribute to the economy. 

Soon, young people with potential to be one of the best will sell equity in themselves in exchange for capital, resources and mentorship. Investing in individuals is the only viable business model for education in a winners-take-most world.

Of course there is no limit to the kinds of activities we will have. The world is positive sum. But, within each domain the best will capture most of the value, leaving little room for the average.

This shift is inevitable. It is caused by progress. When we invent better technology, or improve human rights, the productivity gap between the best and the rest rises.

Variance in ability is a byproduct of complexity. The more complex our activities are, the more variance we see in ability for that activity - no matter the quality, or duration, of their training.

No matter how much training startup founders / creators have, there is bound to be large variance in their ability due to the inherent complexity of the skill itself.

For simpler skills, with enough training, it is possible to become close to the best in ability. The best factory worker is only moderately more productive than the average one. But, the best startup founder is orders of magnitude more productive than the average one: the average founder fails, while the best achieves unfathomable outcomes.

Even if the best entrepreneur or artist coached students 24/7 for a decade, the students would still have great variance in ability. There will always be some who are better at making things people want because the activity is far more complex. And most will fail to create something people value.

If we could plot the ability of professionals on a graph, we would notice it follows a power law distribution. The best player is much better than the second-best. The gap is smaller between the second and third best, and so on.

The more complex the activity, the differences are more pronounced. The gap in ability between the best creator and the next best is much larger than the gap between the best factory worker and the next best. By many orders of magnitude.

Our world is rapidly becoming more complex, leading to far greater variance in ability.

Greater leverage makes activities more complex by letting us skip simpler activities and by making complex activities even more complex. Leverage is how little time it takes to implement an idea. The more leverage you have, the less time it takes to manifest your ideas.

Before computers, we spent a lot of time crunching numbers. As we gained better technology, we could spend more time figuring out what to create and how - which are much more complex than crunching numbers.

Greater leverage makes what was once impossible possible, increasing the complexity of an activity. Building software got much more complex when the world adopted smartphones because there were many more possibilities in what you could build and who you could build for.

Our minds don't dream of ideas it believes are impossible to implement. More leverage boosts our confidence, letting us dream wider and bigger which also increases possibilities.

An increase in leverage, by definition, increases the rate which we make decisions. When implementing an idea takes a long time, inequality between individuals doesn't show up quickly. Imagine a game of chess in which each move takes 5 years. By the time the players die, their differences wouldn't be that clear. It's not that the difference in ability wasn't there, but it didn't have enough time to present itself as a difference in productivity.

The faster we make decisions, the more decisions we make, increasing the weight of each decision as it compounds more aggressively. With greater leverage, small difference in ability (in decision making) leads to a far greater difference in productivity. A slightly better player in a long, complex, fair, game making moves rapidly will have much better results.

Since our activities are becoming more complex leading to more variance in ability, and we are making moves more quickly, ***small differences in ability will have much larger differences in productivity***.

Any institution that charges money for education, will face pressure from both sides:
1. More graduates will fail to get hired due to the inherent power law in productivity for complex skills, making paying for education more risky.
2. The cost of a quality teacher increases because fewer individuals have the required skill to teach. And those who can, will be more expensive than ever before because they will increasingly need to be one of the best at what they do for their teaching to be valuable.

The best knowledge will be available for free because it will come from those who are one of the best, who will have other means of wealth that far surpasses anything they’d get from charging for their knowledge.

The best personalized feedback will be available for equity. The best would only invest time into someone if they have potential. And they would invest in them.

Most bootcamps, paid online courses, colleges will die. The ones that remain will not scale beyond a niche audience: those who don’t need a return on investment. The top colleges may linger around for a while because their primary value is in bringing together smart ambitious young people, not in the education. The rest won’t.

It will take some time for this to pervade the world. Leverage grows at different rates. We will see paying for education fail for software engineering much sooner than for manufacturing related skills.

Paying for education is trap. It doesn’t have the same value as it did in a less complex world in which you could predictably train yourself to be one of the best.
