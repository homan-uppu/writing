Let me put this craving into words, analyze whether I need to give it importance or decondition it, and then write down the next steps.

This craving is a desire for greater solitude. One in which I sit and write a lot more. I feel that the current home environment isn't conducive for the path that I'm on.

This is a valid craving. It definitely would be more productive to operate out of my own space. For sure. There is no denying this. It's a different ballgame altogether when you have a solid routine down.

Where is the optimal place for this? Need to think more deeply about this. I think DD Colony is the best place. There's no need to change this up. You have OU for walks. You have nature. You have a support system here that can take care of many necessities: food, cleaning, etc.

This can honestly be a place for great work. There's no need to re-create this support system elsewhere. That feels like a bad call. An unproductive call.

I think it's better to double down right here.

But, there needs to be a highly productive system. I need the schedule. I need the lifestyle. And I need to stick to it. This is the challenge.

It's much easier to stick to the lifestyle when you're all in. There's hidden momentum that you can unlock by just committing fully. Serious practice. Impeccable Sila. A diet and lifestyle that supports training.

The mind has to be settled a lot more than it is in order for the path to present itself. There is no other way. It's entirely a mind game.

Just sit and write. Fasting from here on out. There isn't much more to be done. Amen. Come back home late tonight. Get a sense for the mosquitoes, etc. The fasting is the most critical piece to this puzzle. You must lean into it. It's the foundation for the practice and everything else.
