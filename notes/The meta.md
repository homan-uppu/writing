Before you get back to tackling writing subjects, you ought to be clear about WHY your essays so far haven't been compelling. I can't even get myself to read them again. They don't sound like me for some reason. And I need to figure out that reason before I move ahead.

They don't have an engaging voice.
They've been cut so much that I've sacrificed heart for useless efficiency.
I don't want to be "efficient". I want to get my point across in the best way possible. And my "point" isn't just an intellectual thing, it's also emotional. I want to make others feel what I feel about what I'm trying to say. Chasing efficiency seems to toss aside that feeling as well.

I need to fix this problem before I move ahead to writing the next essay.

Also, you have to really WANT to get better at this. You have to deeply desire honing your craft of writing. To find your authenticity. Your voice. You have to strive deeply to find it. To hone it. To master it. This is the path that you're on.

It's going to be a relentless hustle from here on out. I'm going to write my heart out. That's all I'm going to do for this phase. Come. What. May. Motherfucker.

Outside of publishing the 2 essays per week (minimum), I'm not going to restrict what I do outside of that... but it HAS to be about writing. That is the craft that I'm going to double down on from here on out. Or rather, that is my medium of expression. I'm going to find my voice here. And then I'll enter into the visual realm. Amen.

This is going to require great discipline. And perseverance. You can't let up midway. You have to commit and go all the way through. Amen.

Just words. No formatting. No images. Nothing. Just fucking words. This is the bare minimum foundation to start with. Everything else is built on top of this foundation. => Get the damn foundation right. Everything else will follow. Amen.
