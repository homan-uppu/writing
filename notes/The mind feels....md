Nightmares.
Just unnecessary situations of the mind.
Crazy, hilarious in some ways.
Just shows how the mind just keeps chugging away its drama nonstop.

The negative feelings exist because you're unable to fully accept them. The trick is complete acceptance. When you accept and ease into the situation, the feelings lose their power. That is the essence of the practice.

Concentration required to feel the sensations.
And then wisdom is required to ease into it.
This kind of wisdom is a "muscle".
