To create a **human-like AI** that we can interact with to help us learn and create.

### The future
We will live in a world with many, many AI agents that we interact with as we interact with other humans. These agents, in many ways, will be more capable than we are. They'll do things for us. They'll help us create. And eventually, they'll be so essential to our daily lives that we can't imagine life without them. They'll be a part of us. We'll feel as lost as Master Chief did when he didn't have access to Cortana anymore. Many of us would feel as if we had lost a loved one when our AI companion leaves us / is taken from us.

What will it take to be able to create such agents? What's the nature of this work, and why?

### What can an AI agent help you do?
- **Learn**.
- **Do**. (productivity - lets you focus on the things that you care more about).
- **Create**. (create in any medium: code, writing, video, music, etc.)
- **Think**: ( / process) brainstorm, act as a sounding board, help you introspect, work through what you're feeling, etc.
- **Play**.

Some of these go hand in hand.

**Some thoughts**:
- The "intelligence via API" is just one part of the larger puzzle: how to build a human-like experience to connect with, and to work with.
- [[A new approach. A new identity]]

### Inspiration from art

Potential seeds of inspiration.

I specifically want to explore the agent that can help you learn something new. In an engaging, fun wa.

Fuck consumption, we're talking about chatting with AI as a lens into the world. That is consumption. That is thinking. That's a lot of things.
