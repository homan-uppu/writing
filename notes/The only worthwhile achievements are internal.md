The only worthwhile achievements are internal. Every external "achievement" is a distraction, and often misleading.

If you help someone and feel greater compassion and peace, that's a win. If you help someone and your ego is inflated because it feels like it's so important that it was able to help someone - then helping has actually hurt you.

The only barometer for progress is equanimity. At some point in your evolution, nothing should phase you. You should be able to work steadfast towards what you want without being swayed, disheartened, etc.

I ought to write about this - about how my internal state is what I want to optimize for. That's the only thing that matters.
