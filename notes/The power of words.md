https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpZQUihCRgs - this man is incredible. The right words, in the right sequence, delivered in the right way can cause goosebumps.

That's incredible. In addition to writing, I need to work on excellent delivery. With the right body language, rhythm, everything.

This is such an important skill. Possibly the most important skill for me to develop.
