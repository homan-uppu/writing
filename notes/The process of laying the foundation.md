There is no way around this process.
Must keep moving forward.
One step at a time.

The right foundation, the right direction, the right people together will lead to incredible momentum that you can't even fathom right now. Why it's so important to keep moving forward no matter how it feels in the moment.

And be OK with failing gloriously. But, at the least, fail in the arena, not on the sidelines / on the path to the arena.

Continue to build your physical and mental strength through the practices. Keep at it.
