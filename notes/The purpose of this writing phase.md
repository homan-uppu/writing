To build long-term conviction so that I can operate effectively for the upcoming decade (or more) towards a single direction with clarity and focus.

I want to play a determined long-term game.

Once I have conviction, I'm going to start product / experiment ideating to start executing with this conviction. Once you have the foundation, I can guarantee that you will have many great ideas. This time around, take the time to craft the angle well before you attack it. This time, have conviction and **be right** about it before executing.

This is the system you need to execute efficiently for this upcoming, important phase in life.

This writing isn't about building an audience, or getting a certain number of views or whatever. None of that matters. The only outcome I'm striving for is the internal clarity with which I can act decidedly and swiftly. The clarity that will hold me accountable on my journey. Amen.
