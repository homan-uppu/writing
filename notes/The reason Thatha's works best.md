1. minimal burn as you lay the foundation.
2. no travel necessary. every single thing taken care of by people you trust: from chores, to cooking to everything. the only thing you need to do is get up and grind.
3. at some point, based on progress, it might make sense to move to Gachi / Manikonda / etc. to set up a small studio to produce content. i'll probably need a few more months before i have the necessary foundation for this. may also have the opportunity to go directly to SF after this. no need to fixate on the future.

this gives you extra cash in hand. you'll basically be holding onto the 17L for the foreseeable future. you can utilize that money in powerful ways:
- high production value vid.
- hire an editor for feedback on a piece.
- make trips (other cities / countries) in order to meet certain people in person if that would help.

you basically give yourself incredible flexibility by keeping burn low, which is esp important as the roadmap / clarity isn't there yet. still nascent exploration. keep at it. follow your curiosity. be stupidly ambitious... that is the only way.
