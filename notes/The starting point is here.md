No matter where you choose to go (Himalayas), you're going to build a foundation here first.

41 days of exceptional conduct. Define what this conduct is, and go at it.

You're not ready to go to the mountains in a serious, committed way. But I do believe that is your destiny. There is undeniably a deep calling to go. But, there needs to be a preparatory phase first. You can't get around this.

Another angle: find a place in Srisailam for more serious meditation, and spend every weekend there meditating. Start building a more serious practice. This is essential. Slowly, that practice will become your default.

My interests are also quite clear: organizing the right knowledge to enable better discovery and absorption. I want to innovate at the most fundamental level of what it means to learn.

On regret: I've always regretted sticking to the education system. For actually going through school instead of convincing parents to let me be homeschooled (before age 18), and afterwards, just taking my own path of exploration in life. Formal education was detrimental to my development as a human being. Formal education applies a forcing function towards the average. It's garbage.
