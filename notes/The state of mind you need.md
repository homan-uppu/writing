"Complete awareness of body and mind in relation to the goal is known as 'zanshin'. Literally translated, zanshin means “the mind with no remainder.” In other words, the mind completely focused on action."

Zanshin: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanshin - "is a state of awareness, of relaxed alertness".

Every thought not directed towards the goal is wasted. This includes thoughts and feelings craving the results, comparing yourself with others, etc.

Every thought must be directed towards the target. Else you won't hit it.

This is **why the practice is critical**. The tougher the situation, the more important your practice becomes, and the more you ought to be sharpening the mind.

Every time your mind goes to the past "Oh, I wish I had done that then", or goes into the future fearing scenarios, you must pull it back to the present moment, back into Zanshin.

The better you are at this pulling your attention back to the present, the more effective you shall be. The rewards for this skill follows an exponential curve, not linear.
