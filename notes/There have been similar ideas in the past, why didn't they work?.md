I'm aware of 3 categories of attempts:
1. Value of the token grounded in future salary instead of equity in companies (Income sharing: [ISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_share_agreement)).
	- e.g: [Creator token](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/creator-tokens-and-community-tokens/)
2. Purely speculative: personal tokens that aren't grounded in actual value (based purely on hype / popularity).
	1. Buying NFTs hoping they will appreciate when the creator becomes more popular.
	2. [friend.tech](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-friend-tech).
3. [Publicly traded human](https://www.wired.com/2013/03/ipo-man/)

These approaches didn't work because:

A personal token must be grounded in actual value. Hype cannot sustain the valuation of a token.

Grounding a personal token in future salary does not work because the power law distribution of outcomes is rapidly becoming more extreme for all kinds of work - as a direct consequence of AI making all work more creative ([further reading](https://homan.sh/vc-learning)). As the power law distribution becomes more extreme, the median outcome falls, and therefore increasingly ISAs will be defaulted, proportional to how extreme the power law distribution of outcomes becomes.

Note: this is also why ISA based bootcamps are bound to fail: most won't earn enough from a salary to sustain the bootcamps investment. And more generally, any educational institute that charges money in exchange for teaching will not be financially sustainable in the age of intelligence.

And lastly, incorporating a human being as a company and selling shares doesn't work because many of the mechanisms that apply to companies (such as shareholders being able to vote on company actions) cannot apply to individuals. Also, incorporating such a "weird" company is too much of a legal hassle for most people to even want to try.

This is the time for the concept of personal tokens to take off because:
1. AI is about to take-off, making the power law distribution of outcomes very extreme across all kinds of work.
2. Personal tokens are inherently securities, and therefore require legal, regulatory support. The current US government is very pro-active about providing the necessary regulatory clarity required to implement personal tokens.
