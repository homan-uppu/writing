Than to understand what you are.
To accept reality in this moment. Whatever that reality presents itself as.
A choice-less observation.
To see what is there, not what you want.
To surrender to the forces that dictate what happens within and outside.
To surrender to the Dhamma: the laws that govern the universe.

What more is worthwhile.
