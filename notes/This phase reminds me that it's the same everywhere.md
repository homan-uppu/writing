Whether you're in the center of Tokyo, San Francisco, Banglore, Hyderabad, or the foothills of the Himalayas, it's all the same because you carry the same mind with you everywhere you go.

If you expect a place to give you a "better" experience than another - whatever that means to you - it will only be a temporary buzz. Sooner or later, the mind falls back to whatever habits, and its wellbeing depends on what those habits are. You may be able to distract your mind from your habits with some new novel, exciting experience, but sooner or later, the habits will pull your mind back to its natural baseline.

The only way to have a truly transformative experience is to work on your mind - at the level of its most core habits. The more you master your mind, the more profound your experience will be - no matter where you go.

So, strive for the great mind, not to be in a "great" place. Such a place doesn't exist.

Train the mind. That is the source of all of your experiences.
