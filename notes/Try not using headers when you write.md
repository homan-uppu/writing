PG does this a lot. This ought to be something I actually ask him someday.

My hunch is that it's because it forces a more natural narrative structure. A stream of consciousness, a flow of clarity, often doesn't neatly fit into rigid "compartments". When we visually see a header and then start reading, our minds subconsciously separate (subtly) the upcoming section from the previous one, as if we were somewhat starting fresh.

But that division / break / separation of one train of thought from another can be detrimental if the intention is for it to feel like a smooth train of thought as you may hear in a conversation with someone.

As I'm writing, I'm also finding that when I don't allow myself to use headers to break the writing into sections, I'm more mindful of the transitions. I'm more intentional about how I transition from one thought to the next. And not only intentional, I spend more time thinking about it! And the great benefit about thinking about how to transition to the next thought is that I often realize that the next thought I had in mind as the natural next step actually isn't! And that's it something else entirely.

This is what I think the greatest benefit to not using headers while writing is. I still think it makes sense to present with headers especially as writing gets very long. But using headers while writing may mask a suboptimal choice in the next thought.

I say "try" in the title because I'm not sure if this works or whether you'd benefit from it or now. It's something that seems to have tangibly improved my ability to write, and I'd love to hear the results of your experiment with this if you choose to try it out.
