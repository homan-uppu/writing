Venture capital is a form of financing for risky, high-potential projects. Investors give companies money, so that they can build their product, in exchange for some ownership in the company itself. 

Investors know many of their investments will fail, but they bet that the few massive successes will more than make up for the losses. For example, an investor might invest in ten startups knowing that seven might fail completely, two might return their money, but one might become the next big thing and generate returns hundreds of times larger than their initial investment.

This model works particularly well for financing things that follow power law distributions - where a small number of winners capture most of the value. Traditional financing, like bank loans, works best when outcomes follow a normal distribution (think of a bell curve) where most borrowers can repay their loans with modest success. But venture capital is designed specifically for situations where outcomes are highly skewed - where most attempts generate little value, but a few generate enormous value. This is why venture capital has been so successful in technology, where a single breakthrough product can capture an entire market.

If investors invest in companies, does this mean everyone has to start their own company in order to be invested in? How exactly would venture capital financing work for education?

An ambitious high schooler today, instead of going to college, can directly start a company and create something the world wants. They can directly generate revenue and / or raise money from investors for their project. There’s a growing number of young people pursuing this path, some with great success. As AI becomes more powerful and our work becomes far more creative, we should see many more young people directly pursue building companies. 

But, starting a company typically requires the founding team to have at least a rough idea of the problem they’re tackling, how they’re going to do it, and strong competence - else it’s difficult for an investor to put money in their hands. Developing this foundation of an idea and competence can take some time, which again puts disproportionate stress on those who don’t have the financial means to take the time to develop this foundation.

Some incredibly valuable paths also require more exploration before the individual discovers the important angle to tackle. For example, Charles Darwin required extensive exploration and study of nature before he had his breakthrough that shook the scientific community, and later the world. Darwin was partly financially supported by his family during the early stages of his career, which allowed him the freedom to thoroughly explore his interests and develop his revolutionary ideas over many years.

And lastly, not every talented person is going to want to take the risk of starting a company. Many who are great at what they do will want to join great companies rather than start one. 

We need a way to invest in individuals before / independent of whether they have a company they want to build right now.
