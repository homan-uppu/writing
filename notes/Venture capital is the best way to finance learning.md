Venture capital is a form of financing for risky, high-potential projects. Investors give companies money, so that they can build their product, in exchange for some ownership in the company itself. 

Investors know many of their investments will fail, but they bet that the few massive successes will more than make up for the losses. For example, an investor might invest in ten startups knowing that seven might fail completely, two might return their money, but one might become the next big thing and generate returns hundreds of times larger than their initial investment.

This model works particularly well for financing things that follow power law distributions - where a small number of winners capture most of the value. Traditional financing, like bank loans, works best when outcomes follow a normal distribution (think of a bell curve) where most borrowers can repay their loans with modest success. But venture capital is designed specifically for situations where outcomes are highly skewed - where most attempts generate little value, but a few generate enormous value. This is why venture capital has been so successful in technology, where a single breakthrough product can capture an entire market.

If investors invest in companies, does this mean everyone has to start their own company in order to be invested in? How exactly would venture capital financing work for education?

An ambitious high schooler today, instead of going to college, can directly start a company and create something the world wants. They can directly generate revenue and / or raise money from investors for their project. There’s a growing number of young people pursuing this path, some with great success. As AI becomes more powerful and our work becomes far more creative, we should see many more young people directly pursue building companies. 

But, starting a company typically requires the founding team to have at least a rough idea of the problem they’re tackling, how they’re going to do it, and strong competence - else it’s difficult for an investor to put money in their hands. Developing this foundation of an idea and competence can take some time, which again puts disproportionate stress on those who don’t have the financial means to take the time to develop this foundation.

Some incredibly valuable paths also require more exploration before the individual discovers the important angle to tackle. For example, Charles Darwin required extensive exploration and study of nature before he had his breakthrough that shook the scientific community, and later the world. Darwin was partly financially supported by his family during the early stages of his career, which allowed him the freedom to thoroughly explore his interests and develop his revolutionary ideas over many years. (Meanwhile many other potential Darwins were stuck plowing fields and doing work to survive that prevented them from following their natural curiosities.)

Lastly, not every talented person is going to want to take the risk of starting a company. Many who are great at what they do will want to join (or invest in) great companies rather than start one. 

**We need a way for individuals with potential to be able to raise money to fund their learning - regardless of when (or whether) they start a company.**

As a thought experiment, let's assume we have the following system:
1. A financial abstraction ("Human company") that represents all of an Bob's assets: the companies and the physical & digital assets that he owns.
2. Someone (Alice) can buy ownership in "Human company" such that Alice indirectly owns a percentage of Bob's assets.
3. With the permission of Bob, Alice can share her equity in Bob's "Human company" to someone else.

Like a regular company, the value of a "Human company" before an individual has create any value is more art than science because it is based on the individual's potential to earn over the long-run. Even if Bob has zero assets now, if enough people believe in Bob's potential, a 1% equity in Bob's "Human company" could be worth tens of thousands of dollars or more. By, selling stake in his "Human company", Bob trades some of his future wealth for incredibly valuable capital today which would help enable him to generate that future wealth.

Now, let's revisit the situation we analyzed in the previous section: Bob is young, ambitious and has shown early talent for designing products. Bob wants to spend his time tinkering and honing his craft, and possibly also exploring other avenues of expression he's curious about such as creating content. Bob would then raise money on this potential. If a handful of people (or even just one!) believe that over the course of the next couple of decades Bob will do great work that will create tremendous value, they'd buy equity in Bob's "Human company". Bob gets capital to fuel his tinkering and experimentation.

This is how an individual could raise money through venture capital (VC) to fund their education. 

In a highly creative world with a heavily skewed power law distribution of outcomes, VC is a much better way to finance education than all of the approaches we considered in the previous section: (*todo: list these out to re-introduce the status quo that we're comparing VC with*).

**VC scales**
When Bob raises money by selling equity in his "Human company", it may seem that from Bob's perspective it's the same outcome as applying for and getting a grant. Though it may be practically the same thing from Bob's perspective, when investors can invest directly in an individual's "Human company", we would see orders of magnitude more capital available to young people because investors would be drawn to invest their money in order to multiply their wealth like how starving bees are drawn to nectar.

Greed scales.
Greed is reliable.
Greed is anti-fragile towards economic volatility.

**VC aligns incentives**
When Alice invests in Bob, it's in Alice's best interests to help Bob succeed because Alice only generates wealth if Bob does as well. Alice would connect Bob to mentors and resources that would help Bob 

**VC will be the only way to afford the best teachers**
As the power law distribution of outcomes becomes more skewed, the best teachers will be far too expensive for any institution to be able to hire them. No business school can afford Elon Musk or Paul Graham to teach. No computer science program will be able to afford the best engineers. No design school will be able to afford the best designers. The gap between their market value and what an institution can pay them will be too great.

The best teachers will teach for free in exchange for equity in outcomes because the potential returns from that are actually meaningful.

We would see engineering / design schools run similar to how startup accelerators are run: those accepted are **paid to join** and learn from great mentors and peers, in exchange for small equity in their outcomes, which they would be more than happy to give up (unless they have better alternatives already).

**VC incentivizes distributing knowledge freely**
When the best teachers can directly invest in their students' outcomes, many will share all of their knowledge to the world for free as marketing to attract students to them because their wealth will predominantly come from the future success of their students, rather than by selling courses, etc.

As the power law becomes more skewed, and with the ability to invest in individuals, only mediocre teachers will be the ones putting their knowledge behind a paywall, because if they could actually impact a student's outcomes, they'd make far more wealth by investing in students directly.

**VC democratizes access to opportunity**
Greed will drive investors to discover and enable talent regardless of the wealth they come from. A budding content creator in rural Alabama, a high schooler in inner city Baltimore with a strong aptitude for engineering, or an affluent child in a Bay Area suburb with talent for design would all be sought after by investors.

Of course it'll take time for opportunity to be truly democratized. Those who don't come from means will continue to be underrepresented for a while because it's more difficult for them to develop sufficient skills to allow their innate talents to manifest due to environmental challenges out of their hands. For example: even if a child has a strong aptitude for design, if they grow up in a violent, neighborhood with parents who neglect them, their talent will have a difficult time expressing itself, and therefore investors wouldn't want to take a risky bet on them.

But, VC creates the economic incentives to create the right environment for an individual's innate talents to shine, because the more talent available, the more wealth can be generated for everyone involved: the individuals, and their investors.

(prob. needs some more expansion - explanation feels too naive).
