"**282.**Â Wisdom springs from meditation; without meditation wisdom wanes. Having known these two paths of progress and decline, let a man so conduct himself that his wisdom may increase."

There is no stagnation. Only accelerated progress or accelerated decline. Nothing in between.

Must practice.
