Intellectual understanding of how asymmetry is rising is not enough to act optimally.

We have two fundamental problems holding us back from acting optimally which both stem from the limitations of our minds.

Our first problem is that we do not have an intuitive grasp of exponential change. Even if you intellectually see the current asymmetry of the world and how it's increasing rapidly, you will certainly be surprised and caught off guard. We don't have to look far back to see why. Before the COVID-19 pandemic took off, many nations and institutions had the math right: they could all see the rapid spread of the virus. Heck, even I read an essay in February 2020 that predicted that we'd have a global pandemic. Yet, few, if any, of us had the appropriate emotional response. We lacked the appropriate fear and caution that would have enabled us to take the optimal path to preventing the pandemic.

Similarly, even if you believe everything you've read so far, I assure you that we'll all be very surprised as we see asymmetry skyrocket on an exponential curve. And if you want to act optimally today, you're going to look stupid and be laughed at by the world in the same way that anyone who wore a mask in January 2020 would have been. Interestingly, you would have also been ridiculed later in the pandemic because you would have stopped masking and taking precautions before most others did, and would have been hated for "putting lives at risk".

Since we all suck at responding optimally to exponential change, you will always look weird and stupid for acting optimally.

Any change you make in your life that is directionally correct will almost certainly not be a strong enough change. In the COVID analogy, if you believed the math that predicted it, even though the optimal strategy in Jan 2020 was to mask up, you would have just washed you hands an extra time thinking it's enough. This is because even though we understand it something intellectually, we don't have the appropriate fear (that manifests as caution) towards it.

Our second problem is that we don't have even a directionally correct emotional response to equality (symmetry). ***Instead of fearing equality as we should, we crave it.***

This makes shifting our behaviors to act optimally even more difficult than it would have been to act optimally towards a viral pandemic because we don't crave a pandemic (except maybe psychos), as we crave equality. Undoing craving and cultivating fear is more difficult than just cultivating fear. And it's not twice as difficult, it's orders of magnitude more difficult because overcoming craving is far more difficult than cultivating fear.

Our craving for equality blinds us to reality. The more disconnected our beliefs are from reality, the more we suffer. And reality is slipping away from us quickly. Through the following examples I hope to show you how our intuitions are outdated.
