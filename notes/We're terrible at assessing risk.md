(From discussion with Gautam.)

People generally overestimate the downside of doing something. The reality is many things in life are set up as: massive potential upside, and minimal to no downside.

Correctly identifying risk is an important skill because it enables you to exploit all of these asymmetries which contain most of the things worth achieving.

I succumb to this as well. In many cases, this miscalculation happens in the subconscious and the inherent aversion to it means that the thought doesn't even reach the conscious mind. PG calls this the "schlep blindness", and I think it's fundamentally connected to this theme of miscalculating / misunderstanding risk.

Examples:
- Walking into another college's career fair.
- Mustering up the courage to ask someone you like out on a date.
- Starting a startup / creating on the internet.
- Doing anything that isn't following a clearly defined path.
