BSK is too raw for my liking. He depicts characters that I honestly hope I never run into in my life.

Unfortunately, the reality is that I will run into them. A lot.

It actually makes me sad that those kinds of people exist. It's honestly sad that people think with such negativity. And are so jobless that they just sit and eat away all the money they have.

It's important to be productive. It's important to create value in this world.

I respect productivity greatly. There are few things as satisfying as an honest day's work.

When I see movies like this, it makes me want to help build a world in which people have the means to be productive contributors to society. I think there's a sense of fulfillment and purpose that it brings which is beneficial for an individual, and thereby society as a whole.

And, it also reminded me of the value of sacred spaces. A Vipassana center, an Ashram, or even a startup with a meaningful shared mission are all sacred spaces.

Powerful thought.

I have to thank BSK because he makes me see that which I never want to become. That I want to actively run from. Amen.
