You're caught up in the "Maya" of it all. The games beyond your control. The drama that your mind wants to partake in, but you really shouldn't. The moment you play the comparison game, the mind descends into hell. That is the reality.

Stay in your lane. Look down at the work in front of you. And focus.
Do nothing else.
Don't let the mind wander.
Practice more.
Maintain strong Sila.
And attack.

This is all you can do.
Build the rhythm. The momentum.
Amen.

Make this a "job". That's all you need to do. Amen.

Clean up the concentration. The attention must not wander at all. Amen.
