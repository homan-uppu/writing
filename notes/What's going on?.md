Dude. I don't know what to say.

Finding a great inertia in my mind. Because I'm not focused on the present moment. Am I burned out? I don't feel like it, but maybe I am?

Just such a tricky phase that I'm in. Just no energy to execute. Hmm... No excitement. No nothing. I feel like I'm in some kind of rut. Absolutely fascinating.

No drive to hack on something late into the night.

You definitely need a daily publishing cadence to re-energize the mind. I can't imagine any other way to kickstart this?

Do a weeklong fast to reset the body and mind? I'm really not sure.

I think I just have to lean into it. I can't give myself any chance for distraction. Take drastic steps: no content consumption until you've published your essay, and have a clear spec for the writing feedback essay.

Make sure you have impeccable adherence to your habits: diet, Ashtanga, meditation, Sila. These habits are what will protect you on this journey. Nothing else will come close. It's with these habits that you'll rise.

I honestly believe that writing is what will pull me out of this situation. Writing and publishing on a ruthless cadence. Fascinating.
