Yeah, I'm just going to figure this out now. decide and commit.
your wellbeing and productivity have more to do with the state of your mind than location. but a good set up still goes a long way. I would def be more productive with blazing fast internet and slightly warmer temperature (though the latter i think i can adjust fine)

I'm entering a higher velocity phase:
- i need to be able to dive deep into the history of companies, investing, the laws surrounding them, in order to craft a good spec.
- i need to build a database of folks to reach out to for feedback. I want to be able to add to this every single day.
- after my daily writing session, i want to be designing my personal site, and the presentation layer (images, animations, etc.). i should be able to organize my work to take up the entire day. and meditate in between deep work seshes.
- i want to consume inspiring visuals on Cosmos. i want to improve my taste. the right design for my work will be found as a nice mixture between these 
- i want to code the personal site and start seeing my essays come to life before i share them.

## requirements
- a nice place with lots of natural sunlight, fresh air, greenery.
- 1bhk. anything bigger is a hassle to maintain.
- i should be able to up and leave the country whenever the opportunity presents itself. without much baggage to deal with.
- ridiculously fast internet: 1gbps. minimize time to turn idea into reality. i.e. stream LLm responses, edit code w/ Cursor, Design with Figma, make videos as required.
- kitchen set up so that i can cook on my own.
- access to urbanclap / house help to come clean (and deep clean) on a regular basis.

be far away from any kind of family / friends. i'm not meeting anyone to socialize until i achieve escape velocity. only transactional meetings from here on out: i.e. only interact with people who can help me craft and bring my vision to life. that is it. no one else. i predict that most of these interactions will be online because the best talent is distributed around the world. this requirement is more important than i'm giving it credit for because people impact each other in deep, subconscious ways without even knowing it. one conversation about how much someone is getting paid / raising money pulls my mind to want to optimize for short-term money. that pull is incredibly dangerous. it will infiltrate your mind and control you from within. you'll only realize once you find yourself badging yourself into some company office. good riddance.



## finances

recurring:
- 2k - internet
- 3k - house help
- 10k - food related.
- 3k - yoga.
- 10k - misc.
- 10k - work related software services
- 30k - rent.

roughly 80k.

one time:
- 2L perfect desk setup.
- 1L deposit.

80k * 12 = 10L
=> total expenditure in a year is already 13L roughly.

this is bad because it reduces the money i have to increase production value. e.g. i'd like to spend 5L on a video creating setup. this will be required / invaluable when the time is right. perhaps i can skimp on this. actually i should: i.e. use AI to translate me into an Anime character or something so that i don't have to worry about lighting, etc. but, there just could be something important that i'd like to be able to spend money on to improve production value. what exactly i could spend on, for which aspects of the products, etc. are things that i can't predict up front.

counterargument: if you back yourself well, and publish great ideas, getting some capital won't be a problem. 
countercounterargument: if you're going to raise any kind of money, you'll need to show a clear path to making it back. and i don't want the pressure of having to pitch in that way. the mindspace that i'm in right now is open-ended research. it's exploratory.

there is something more dangerous than just "losing money", it's the impact it has on the subconscious.
