[Venture capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital) is a way to fund high-potential projects. Unlike loans that require steady repayment regardless of success, investors invest money in exchange for a share of future value. They know many of their investments will fail, but they bet that the few massive successes will more than make up for the losses. For example, an investor might invest in ten companies knowing that seven might fail completely, two might return their money, but one might become the next Google and generate returns hundreds of times larger than their initial investment.

This model works particularly well for financing things that follow power law distributions - where a small number of winners capture most of the value. Traditional financing, like bank loans, works best when outcomes follow a normal distribution (bell curve) where most borrowers can repay their loans with modest success. But venture capital is designed specifically for situations where outcomes are highly skewed - where most attempts generate little value, but a few generate enormous value. This is why venture capital has been so successful in technology, where a single breakthrough company can capture an entire market.

Bot uses this money to fund his learning: whether that's through an institution, o bu

But, don't we already have grants and scholarships to fund talented, yet not wealthy, individuals? What's the need for the ability to "invest" in the outcomes?
