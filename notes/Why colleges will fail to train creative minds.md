You have to start at the clearly defining the consequences of the rising bar for creativity. The consequences should neatly feed into the argument for why colleges / any transaction based model won't be great at educating masses.

What are the consequences of rising bar for creativity?
1. Power law distribution.
2. Training doesn't guarantee mastery in a certain time period.
3. Theory 

The flow:
1. Rising bar for creativity + consequences.
2. Using software engineering as a case study that shows what happens to a skill when it goes from non-creative to creative, and how the consequences above actually manifest in real life.
3. Why colleges won't train creative minds. (economics and incentives don't allow them to) - and by extension, any tuition based program, though alternate "bootcamps", etc. have a better shot than colleges since they have far less baggage.
4. Yet, college is tough to displace.

You also have to talk about the nature of competence in creative skill, the syntax / the tools are the easiest, smallest part of the puzzle. Go back to software engineering and show what a 10^n engineer / designer / product manager looks like.

These features of creative training makes the tuition-based education model not possible 

The primary point is that because the expected value of the education falls due to lower probability of mastery & no guaranteed timelines, people can't justify risking an investment that may not pan out in a certain period of time.

Can the price of education come down? Not without sacrificing quality feedback, which is critical.

What are the core points here?

1. **Teachers have to be masters** (both for curation, and personalized feedback).
2. **Emphasis on making something people want** (i.e. optimizing for the market).
3. **No guarantee on time to mastery**. (i.e. an "x" year course doesn't work - this is tough to justify actually. Hmm...). 

Teachers have to be masters because the more creative a skill, theory alone becomes less valuable. For creative skills, it's difficult to simply consume content about how to do something, and become proficient at it.

These features destroy the transactional education model.

Masters are too expensive. In order to make it a worthwhile training, the tuition would be far too expensive for a master to justify spending time offering personalized instruction. In fact, the best would much rather do a course and scale infinitely for free. But personalized feedback is where the greatest learning value is.

Variance on time to mastery means it's unclear when ROI on investment will arrive. This means that only those that can afford it, will do this - likely while having a job already. This is what we're seeing in the ed-tech space: bootcamps, cohort-based teaching, etc. target the already professional looking to switch careers / level up their professional skills.

The economics make can't target the 100s of millions of 18 year olds around the world that desperately need a high quality education because of the economics.

People can't afford this tuition not necessarily because they're too expensive, but because of its risk profile. There are many families around the world, especially so in Asia, that are willing to take out loans that may take a decade to repay, in order to provide a great education for their children.

People are willing to make such investments when there's **lower risk in the ROI**. Expected value = value * probability. Creative skills means the probability goes down greatly, thereby making the expected value of education too low to justify an investment.

And the variance on time to mastery means that you can't have lending since the outcome isn't guaranteed.

(Reference Austen's thought here).

(Exceptions will exist: masters who will teach for the sake of teaching, but unfortunately, we can't rely on individual benevolence to scale to the masses).

The more creative the skill, the better the teacher must be in order to be effective.

Personalized feedback is important. And the more creative the skill, the less it can be delegated to non-masters (e.g. TAs, etc.).
