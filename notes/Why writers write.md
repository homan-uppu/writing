"I think there are four great motives for writing, at any rate for writing prose. They exist in different degrees in every writer, and in any one writer the proportions will vary from time to time, according to the atmosphere in which he is living. They are:

(i) Sheer egoism. Desire to seem clever, to be talked about, to be remembered after death, to get your own back on grown-ups who snubbed you in childhood, etc., It is humbug to pretend this is not a motive, and a strong one".

This applies to most creatives. So that fortitude to be ambitious and to chase big projects comes from the ego, and achieving greatness in the public's eyes doesn't necessarily correlate with greatness inside.
