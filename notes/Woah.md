Yeah, I'm feeling quite stuck. Let me think through this situation to see what I can make of it.

There are two essays here:
1. Winner takes all (we're moving in that direction, it is irreversible).
2. Paying for education no longer works.

The important essay here is the second. It really hits the nail.

Leverage increases the complexity of our work.
The more complex our work the greater the asymmetry in outcomes.

I could re-organize in the following way:
1. Paying for education no longer works.
2. How to educate yourself.
