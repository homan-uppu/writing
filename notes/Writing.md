This is my craft for now. I'm going to double down on this until I get momentum. Just write. There is nothing else to do during this phase.

Build your worldview, understand yourself, find the angle of attack. Attack hard.

Craft a thesis that guides your life. That is what is needed in this phase. You must keep at it. Amen.

Your determination will be tested. Just keep publishing. Just keep shipping.
