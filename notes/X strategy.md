1. *Follow the right people*. - this is the most important task. It's the foundation. Stick to 200 - 400 people to start with, that should be enough. Ensure they're top quality (the kind of people I'd want to collaborate with.)
2. 3 well thought out comments a day.
3. Publish a post a day.
4. Wee kly / whenever it's ready - post an essay.

Who to follow? How to discover who to follow?

- *Young, generally ambitious* (the teenagers busting ass to change the world).
- *Young founders* (Aravind)
- *Idea generators* (Cowen, Thiel, Marca, Perrell, PG, Chamath, Taleb).
- *Old guard* (Pcollison, Brockman, Sama)
- *Arts* (Young, ambitious video game developers, filmmakers, musicians - just a handful).

Create some lists - define what those lists ought to be. But I tried this last time and I found that having no lists is better - just get the most interesting people and that's it!

For 70% of people you follow, follower count should be < 50k. That is the sweet spot. They're most likely to engage.

Don't overthink this for now, just go through profiles and add them according to feel. Pin the "Winners take all" post. Knock out 3 comments. Get back to writing essay.
