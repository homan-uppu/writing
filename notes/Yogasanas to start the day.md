this is game changing. i want to have an early start to the day. this whole waking up at 11 is nonsensical. it feels terrible tbh.

i still think back to the Ashtanga practice days fondly in 2021. Damn, it's been almost 4 years!? but yeah, that was when i earnestly started the practice. i remember all i had to do was get my ass to the Shala and that's it, the rest of the practice would unfold on its own.

it's important when your practice is not yet established to have a support system of other people who prioritize the practice, to help you get established. that's the way to do things.
