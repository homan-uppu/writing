It was a night and day difference.
You felt more... alive.
I can't even put it into words just how good that was.
I still remember those days sitting on the chair late mornings / afternoons staring into the park ahead. Looking at those trees. In a contemplative mood. With the body and mind at rest.

That was due to the concentration gains from fasting. Absolutely.
You're literally poisoning your body. Damn.
