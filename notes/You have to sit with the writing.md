And then the flow will naturally come.
You can't avoid the writing and hope that the flow will arrive and THEN you will sit with it. That's how fools write: based on the whims of their feelings.

The greatest writers write from a place of discipline. You write no matter how you feel. If you really don't feel great, then sit for a couple of hours and then get back to writing. It's not that deep.
