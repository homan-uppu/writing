~100 days from now, after serious Sadhana.
The necessity now is to transform the mind and body through a rigorous schedule. Sitting around and "pushing" isn't going to work. You need to open up the mind first.

You need to re-vitalize your body, mind. You need to firmly establish yourself on the path of ascension.

Only then will you find the approach. And during this, you should be diligently writing whenever the mind nudges you to.

If you don't feed the mind anything. And you are established in Yoga. The mind itself will unfold beautifully, without any effort. That is what is important.

Just have to keep at it. The practice starts right here.
