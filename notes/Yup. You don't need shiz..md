Just grind on the laptop itself.
No need for any kind of external setup.
But, when I do find a space to bunker down, I ought to invest in a keyboard, mouse, and stand instead of a monitor. This screen size is absolutely more than enough. Don't need anything more. And you want to remain hyper portable. Yeah, eventually. But until then, this is your driver. Make it count.

just shut the fuck up and write. LOL. That's the message that I need to hear above all else. Just get shit done. Amen.

OK, this is also pretty good if you ask me. The screen is further away but still somewhat do-able. No? Perhaps.
