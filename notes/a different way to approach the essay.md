It's popular to claim that our education system is "broken". I've been hearing this for at least a decade now, yet not much has changed. But, something IS different this time around. AI is changing the world rapidly in a way that invalidates our current education system, and more broadly, it invalidates any institute that charges money for education.

Our education system is going to collapse.

Why? And more importantly, what's going to replace it?
