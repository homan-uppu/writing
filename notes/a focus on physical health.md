feeling a strong desire to get back into running. a solid 10k every single morning. very early morning. a rigorous discipline to help fuel my work. to create a robust routine.

i guess OU is the best running spot i have. LOL.

do i really have no other options? i honestly don't think so. Mokila could work too, but there you're running on the road. not great. yeah, DD colony is unbeatable for running / exercise in general.
