this is outright stupid. i'm not going to spend much more time on this. will prob send the chair back to them via a porter service, ask them to repair / refund it, or ask them to come here, repair it and go back, and pay for petrol costs.

the most important thing: don't waste brain cycles on this. that is far more valuable than the cost of this chair and then some.

lesson learned: never, ever buy used products. buy them brand new straight from the company that makes it. and make sure the store is close to where you live in case you do have to go back to exchange / return it. or use services like Amazon, etc. that will pick up the product from home when you want to return it.

no more exceptions on this front. even do this for homes! if you buy a home, make sure it's built from scratch using material straight from a premium manufacturer. ideally you can even buy those prefab homes straight from a home startup.
