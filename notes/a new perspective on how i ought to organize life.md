1. the practice is top priority. the mindset should be that the practice is the foundation. don't waste a single moment. replace any and all mindless consumption with meditation.
2. diet: 
	1. ADF until you get to target weight (80kg), and then strict OMAD.
	2. whenever you go above 80kg, start ADF(rolling 48).
	3. cut out the coffees with milk, etc. no calories outside of the meal!
3. work:
	1. become more patient through the practice, while maintaining aggressive execution:
		1. aggression without attachment to results.
		2. patient with results. impatient with actions.
	2. you are not leaving Yashoda residency until you hit the exit criteria.
	3. when you leave, you go straight to SF. nowhere else.
