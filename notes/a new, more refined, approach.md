define how i'm going to operate from here on out, and stick to it.
1. **meditation** is the foundation. i'll cultivate a very strong Samadhi that will act as the foundation for my life. nothing will be more important than the practice.
	1. i want to ramp up to 5 hours a day. 1.5 hours to start. 1.5 mid day. 1.5 towards end of day, followed by 0.5 hours when i'm about to pass out (lying down). shorter durations just don't cut it because you don't achieve sufficient depth: the concentration remains very surface level.
2. **diet**: must get back to a strict OMAD. that is when your mind and body function the best. you know this feeling. it's a special kind of feeling + concentration + natural focus.
3. **focus**. toss aside your phone, you don't need it right now. stick to the grind. no social media of any kind (unless you're reaching out to people - in that case X is fine).

get back to the mountain schedule: i don't care when you wake up, but when you do, snanam right away and get to the 90 min. meditation. that's it.

notes:
- re. moving. take it one week at a time. ideally, you achieve strong momentum before you move anywhere. waiting until you have momentum would be the best way to play this phase. don't leave the damn room except for chores, and for exercise. that's it. even if you just want to walk - you can do it on the rooftop. minimize interactions with others.
- there is no use for regrets about the past. be laser focused on the present moment. else, you will just keep regretting things (including regretting itself) for the rest of your life. stay calm. accept whatever has happened, and get back to the present moment.
