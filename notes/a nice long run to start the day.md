i'm holding back from any BLR thoughts because i just don't have a way to go on a nice long run. for some reason, as much as i appreciate yoga, etc. my body just wants to run. i've been that way since i was a child. i just want to run. there's something about running that really sets my body and mind right.

there is honestly no place better than DD colony - and a 10k run through OU to start the day. absolutely nothing beats that. just stick to this for now. perhaps even rent a scooter or something so that you can get to OU faster without having to walk through the streets.

really not much that can beat this. no matter how hard and far you search.

the only challenge is, once you're back inside, you're going to have to stay inside. there isn't really a notion of "walking", etc. fascinating. - unless you get an office space in DD colony (the nice parts), so that you can go out and walk to your heart's desire.
