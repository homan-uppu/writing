a single hour-long sit is worth far, far more than 2 30m sits with a gap between them.

the path to a concentrated, collected mind isn't linear. it goes from very little to a lot very quickly: often in moments.

therefore, depth is necessary.

from here on out. the bare minimum sitting time is 1 hour. unless you absolutely have to (due to some external reason), don't sit for less than an hour.

do your best to expand this duration. try to get this to 1.5, and eventually 2 hours.

this is the only way.
