the practice is the foundation for my life.
the practice is also the foundation for work - especially as AI becomes more powerful.

i need a more robust system of practice.

on the one hand, i'm craving a **space that's dedicated to the practice**.
on the other hand, why can't i just craft a great practice right here right now? i have a dedicated meditation room. i can even buy earplugs if external sounds are a bother. i literally have a room that is completely disconnected from the world in which i can achieve deep states of the practice without any issues. i also have help around the home to make me food and do all the chores so that i can be completely dedicated to my practice and work. i can also go on long walks in the evening through OU - for an hour, hour and a half. my daily exercise can be easily taken care of as well.

AND from a work perspective: 
- you have the best infrastructure possible - as good as your work set up in SF. a great chair, desk, monitor, computer, peripherals, and importantly, blazing fast internet (500mbps has been phenomenal).
- you have access to the necessary infrastructure to create high production value filmmaking products - through the people you know who are well connected in this city.

therefore, there is no better place than right here - if you're optimizing for work, practice, and minimizing burn (for which this is also the cheapest set up you can possibly have - you can't pass 25k / month here no matter how hard you try).

build the practice right here, right now. in the same way that Thatha did: by making do with what you have. the work you have to do is internal. you have no excuses whatsoever. train the mind. master the mind.

therefore, just fucking sit. just fucking sit. keep pushing the daily sitting time upwards. and sit through the entire sits. seriously. focused. without distraction. make each sit count. and significantly clean up your Sila... of which Noble speech is exceptionally important. no more senseless, useless, distracting conversations. every ounce of effort must be towards the goal.

i want to turn my reactions into actions.
i want to create greater space to operate - between stimulus and response.
i need a much deeper practice to be able to do so.
