even if the progress you make is one para a day, but if that para is great, i consider that a success. quality matters most.

if this is the case, you ought to go set up an office space in Netala. that is the perfect place. you have the mountains, the daily hiking, meditation at the Bhairav Mandir, etc. the environment feels conducive.

even if progress is slow, you MUST work towards the essence. and you must work fast - you will inevitably cut much of what you create, but the rate of production must still be there.
