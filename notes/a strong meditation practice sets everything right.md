i guarantee that if you hit a solid 4 hours of practice a day, the mind becomes a different beast: less friction for any activity. you want to do something, you'll just do it. that's the kind of mind that's worth training. (the level of practice i held for a few weeks in Uttarkashi: when i'd pull long sessions on the riverbank).

you need to build up such internal "heat". a strength of concentration that turns the mind into a well trained tool that you can put to use towards whatever you want.

it's important to have such a mind. a worthwhile endeavor to train a well collected, well sharply concentrated mind that can perceive the reality within.
