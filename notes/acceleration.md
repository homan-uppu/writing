how can we turn the timeline into 2 weeks?

don't optimize directly for getting to SF. instead optimize for traction & SF will work itself out.

ways to accelerate:
1. **hire someone for growth**: cold messaging the right people and organizing outreach. will almost certainly be a temporary hire - i can't spend the time and effort to convince the amazing talent, but i can definitely bring on board a good enough talent that can def amplify efforts.
	1. basically handle all the bitch work for growth.
2. **outsource the video production**
	1. not necessarily for the editing, but definitely for the graphics, etc. that's a component that you shouldn't waste brain cycles on at all - AI will do that eventually.
3. **get others involved in the video production much earlier**. don't wait for a perfect script to get people involved. on the draft, start meeting professional screenwriters to get their input on how to craft the best story with the foundation that i have.
	1. e.g. get to Abburi Ravi caliber people much earlier on. => do this right after having the script ready (i.e. tonight).

for the filmmaking side, i predict that the right person will be in HYD... or MUMBAI - i think working closely with Raghav will be super beneficial, along with Sathwik, 

for the outreach side, i predict that the right person will be in BLR.

so no matter the path, it starts with having an excellent video script. let's knock out a draft tonight.
