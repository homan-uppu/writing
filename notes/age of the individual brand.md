Inspired by: https://cozyleigh.studio/ - Maisy Leigh. An incredible, multi-disciplinary creator with her on unique individual brand that simply cannot be copied. It's powerful.

Huge fan of what https://fonsmans.com/ has done. Folks like the cozyleigh, visualizevalue, davidperrell, really leading the way for the era of personal brand.

The compounding surely takes time. But boy is it worth it. Once you build that independent brand, there's really no way to knock you down. It's one of the most robust, anti-fragile achievements. (i think taleb actually uses this as an example of anti-fragility).
