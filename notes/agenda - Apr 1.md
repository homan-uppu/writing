now that i've reasonably settled in here, let me ease into some work.

today, i'm going to focus on writing and meditation. going to start cranking up the hours. and not going to get up from the sit until it is completely complete. no more half-assing sits. it's time to show yourself who you are.

AND: explore secluded cabin options: find a place where you can be secluded, and only socialize when you feel like it. run this experiment and see how much you get done. you can even just go get that cabin!
