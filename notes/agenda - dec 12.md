4. set up outreach 
	1. read the playbook.
	2. craft messaging
	3. superhuman subscription
	4. set up DB (and enrich a bit more).
	5. reach out. - hit the quota today.
	6. write down the system to follow (daily duration enrich + duration outreach)
5. personal token deep dive - all of my attention will now be only towards getting this off the ground. nothing else matters. create the spec, imagine the future.

this is the set up. channel the obsession. it's time. forget your "self", and don't fear success / failure. leave the results to Nature, and just do your job as best as you can.
