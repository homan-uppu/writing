- think through: creative studio. - i DEFINITELY need to get out of here... i can't operate the way i want to in such abundance. this is hurting far more than it's helping. i must fix this. i feel like i'm sinking in this abundance. it's killing me. i can feel it.

that's it. the priority for the next few days is setting up my own space. that is all.
