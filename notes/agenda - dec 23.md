train your concentration so that you can rise above the environment and lose yourself in your exploration. the exploration of this concept is all that matters. everything else is fluff.

thatha's place is perfect to develop this concentration. i can feel his concentration efforts in the Puja room. it's a powerful space. i must keep it burning.

spend an entire week at Thatha's before any kind of decision / purchases (e.g. a good desk, etc). just focus on building concentration, exercising, and working. there is no schedule. there is no routine. there is simply doing what you feel like doing in that moment. that is all.
