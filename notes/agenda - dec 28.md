- get through the personal token white paper
---
- AI as a human essay (publishing tonight at midnight).
- update personal website bio to link to the white paper (while clearly mentioning that it's a draft. and yeah, make the bio more expressive and informative).
- start thinking about the brand, mission statement and the landing page - keep spending time on this when you're on a break / in between things. this is naturally fun, so take advantage of that.

*i like the thought of publishing shorter notes on a regular basis. there's something appealing about building momentum that way. but once again, you cannot have any schedule. you can only publish when you've thought something through sufficiently well. amen.*
