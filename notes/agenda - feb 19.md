1. flesh out the [[ACTIVE]] priorities - based on the realizations from yesterday.
2. **landing page design**. completely analog. start very high level, and slowly bring greater detail into it. you need to give it the space to express itself. just run explorations today. do some figma drafts if you feel up for it, but try to keep it mostly in analog in the early stages.
3. high fidelity design in Figma.
