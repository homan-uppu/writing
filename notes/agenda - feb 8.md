i had a brief feeling yesterday that the video might not be the best approach at the moment. why is that?

- on one hand, i feel that there's potentially a way forward with a stellar landing page, instead of a video. or even if you do a video, it's highly constrained to just the idea, and not the entire "backstory" so to speak.
