- i would like to get through the thinking on decentralization & the entire governance chapter. (i sense that post decentralization, the chapter will flow more smoothly).
- i want to have a gameplan to tackle the implementation chapter. the most important section of this chapter is: MVP - this clearly defines the scope of the Network at launch, and this "spec" will help keep research focused towards just being able to implement this MVP. And this MVP will be the key explanation that lawyers will need to study to provide their feedback on the "legal implementation" section.

that's it. you're at the tail end of the first draft. push through it. i'd like to get to the editing table - which is where the paper is actually written (lol).

grind it out on keyboard - i think i've thought it through sufficiently well.
