1. **A renewed commitment to the practice**. starting today. it's time to get v. v. serious about this. make the practice the foundation. - take the time to write about this. pin it. read it every single day. think this through well. you need to keep reminding yourself about just how valuable this practice is - because it's so darn difficult, making it the first thing that your mind wants to drop. You must resist that temptation. if you get the foundation right, everything else takes care of itself. absolutely.
2. **white paper**. a complete pass through with edits.
3. **set up outreach system and hit today's quota**. it's a numbers game.
4. **videos**. 
	1. transcribe my thinking process from Sat. about why create content, and what the theme of creation will be. if you still think this holds, then write a quick draft for the first video.
