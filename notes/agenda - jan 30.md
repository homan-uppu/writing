1. think about content consumption. be **far** more intentional about this. consider building a custom tool tailored for your consumption.
2. writing is important. keep coming back to writing. be better about publishing your thinking to the world for feedback. personal tokens open up a new fractal of possibilities. there are nearly infinite topics to write about that are directly relevant to personal tokens and how they will play out.
3. the lows can be low. you're going to feel like shit. you're going to feel useless. don't try to run away from this feeling. look at it head on. lock eyes with it. observe it: how it rises, how it changes, how it influences your thinking. sooner or later, it shall pass. by trying to run away from it, you actually feed it energy. by standing your ground and observing it, you let it run its natural course and fade away as it runs out of the energy to overpower you. train this skill. it's the most valuable skill there is - especially for someone walking your path.

you're going to crack this growth puzzle. for sure.
