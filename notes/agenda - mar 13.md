- outreach strategy + commitment to hitting the numbers (which is what it's all about).
- content strategy (which, in essence, is personal brand strategy).
- the mindset of balancing outreach & content.
- execution:
	- outreach messaging + build the list + reach out (from 8pm onwards).
	- content execution: start working on the first piece, and look to ship it when it's ready.

- strict OMAD from today onwards. 
- you must go on a long walk (coupled with pushups, etc.) in the evening as a daily routine. it is incredibly unhealthy to avoid this... the body will deteriorate, and therefore the mind shall as well. don't neglect physical health.
