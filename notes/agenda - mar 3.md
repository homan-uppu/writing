- i'm going to explore some visual styles for the landing page and overall brand.
- craft a great website experience.
- review and edit the /why - consider adding an image (of the power law) + examples.

- get an X profile for PersonalToken.
- think deeply about the socials for homan and personal token (whether they are same at the start, etc.).

- consider a custom page for early access form.
- stronger CTA on the landing page - needs to be prominent in the body as well, not just in the Navbar.

---

once all of this is nailed, move onto thinking deeply about the outreach strategy (and the content strategy to go with it).
