- take a session to just put down a bunch of bullet points - as they come to your mind - about what you think should go into the manifesto. have no constraints on ordering or whether it even makes sense. assume most of what you write will not even make it to the final. that shouldn't even be a concern.
- rethink GTM: i'm leaning towards building the right founding team and going from there, instead of trying to pitch personal tokens directly. the latter will happen once you have a team that is aligned on the grander vision of the future.
- there is a 10^n better approach than what you have. find it.
