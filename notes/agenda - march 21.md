- decide and plan the move to the mountains. be very clear about what your schedule will be, and importantly, what your exit criteria will be. - you cannot go there without a crystal clear plan for what you want to do, and without necessary supplies to be productive (unlike last time when you didn't take your keyboard, mouse, and basically sat with terrible posture during your work sessions).

that's it. and, if you're not going (well, this isn't an option at this point. you must go. you're not going to achieve the breakthroughs you require sitting here. the solitude is absolutely required).
