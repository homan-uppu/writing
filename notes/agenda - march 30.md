- make a strong commitment to knocking out a solid essay draft from right here. whether it takes 2 days, or 2 weeks, or whatever. but, make the commitment strong.
- boil down the essence into a paragraph: if you were to describe the crux of the essay - the emotional core of it - to someone, what would you say.

- you have an incredible opportunity here to really build concentration. this environment is perfect to establish deep concentration. i haven't experienced a better environment other than perhaps CVC / a home in the woods in CA. lean into this opportunity. really hone the concentration. build some depth in the practice. it will serve you well.
- and it's really in the depths of that concentration that you seek truth well. lean into it brother. lean deep into it.
- this is actually a much better sitting position. quite convinced that i can knock this essay out of the park from this place. just have to give myself the time and space to ease into it. it's even OK if there are many people in this work space every once in a while (e.g. on the weekends, etc). as long as there are enough phases as calm as this, i should be able to make significant progress.

OK, let's get it. amen.
