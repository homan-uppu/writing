it's time to get the grind on.

today is a simple day. knock out the essay. that's absolutely all you have to get done.

and i'm going to ramp up my meditation to support my efforts to knock out the essay. need to have a solid draft by the end of the day no matter what.

and then create a solid research plan, get started on the next piece, and also find an editor to help knock out...
