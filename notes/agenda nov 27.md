follow up re. the space at 5:30pm. grind till then.

- **close the deal** with Payaswini for the space and go on a buying spree to get it set up. well, i can't go on a buying spree because of UPI limits lol. will need to see if the card works. hmm... yeah, will need to set up the space tomorrow.
	1. get whatever you need set up.
- work through the draft of the essay.
- super long meditation session to close the day out.

*damn, the coffee at true black is better than here. lol.
*this whole cafe working thing is overrated. nothing beats a great study environment*.

there are no flats available, and it looks like i burned the opportunity for the great 1rk that i saw... interesting.

the alt is set up a great space in Hyd and grind out of there. ship something great and just go straight to SF from there. all set. one clean transition. applies a greater forcing function to find the path to SF sooner.

perhaps i don't have a strong enough justification to grind out of here? not sure. for this price, can literally rent a solid Villa in Hyd LOL.

there are simply no good options. that blows. supply seems super low at the moment. what can be done? just wait it out.
