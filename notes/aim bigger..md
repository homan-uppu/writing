how to speed up this process 1000x?

ok, let's think through this.
what's the fastest way to get this off the ground?

there is an order of magnitude better approach here. you have to find it. to be able to find it, you have to be able to see it. to be able to see it, you need to concentrate, still the mind, and direct it towards this question until you have a good enough breakthrough.

let's start. unfiltered brainstorming:
- single minded focus towards actually shipping this. i mean actually - as in you should have everything in place to execute. this starts with the design of the network: i.e. visualize everything. if you appear to be laser focused on shipping it, and actually fucking serious about doing so, the world will rally behind you. but, it has to be dead serious: to your core.

ok, let's say i have $1m in the bank. i'm sitting in SF right now and i know people who can introduce me to anyone in the world (i.e. everyone is one intro away from someone i know).

how would i play this game?

firstly, i wouldn't spend even a second on things that are not on the critical path: e.g. the feedback system (because if someone really wants to give feedback, they're going to find a fucking way), the PeopleDB (completely unnecessary at this stage - just keep track of everything in a Notion database for now, and only when you reach the limits of that consider "upgrading").

i would write out what i think the critical path is, and i would practice intense Sadhana: minimize the number of mental cycles that aren't dedicated to the critical path.

priorities
- **attracting the right collaborators** - this is the most important. the right people working together on a shared mission will automatically produce the right white paper.
- **white paper** - the spec for what to implement.
	- this will require extensive research and collaborating with lawyers, etc. to get this right.
- **getting initial users in line** (before anything is even built). we will need a supply of VCs who want to participate in our launch. i'm v. confident the demand exists: i.e. individuals who want to raise money on their potential. heck i am part of the demand.
- **shipping**. execute the first batch of investments.

the path
1. work backwards: write the outreach email with the succinct description of what you're working on, why, and a clear set of asks (don't hold back on the asks. believe in urself).
2. create a Gdoc for research open questions that i'm trying to answer and why (that references the essays at the top). link to my research from the site (perhaps from the bio itself).
	1. let people leave comments on this (Chris Paik's framework style).
