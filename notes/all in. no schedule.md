grind until you pass out.
get up and repeat.
that's it. there are no schedules, no rules, nothing.
just make sure you drink lots of water, meditate, eat once / twice (max), and exercise daily. do these activities when it's naturally time, without any kind of schedule. just be. direct most attention towards work.
