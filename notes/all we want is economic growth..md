sure, we say health, freedom, safety, etc. but everything we desire is indirectly a desire for economic growth.

**greater health** = create more, leading to faster growth.
**greater freedom** = more unique ideas = greater economic growth.
**greater safety** = less unnecessary deaths and living in fear = greater creativity = greater economic growth.

similarly, optimizing for the economy also improves the other things that we care about on a long enough time scale. we live in a safer, more free world than ever before. 

### is this a universal truth?
