everything else will follow. this is the nature of writing.
the intro sets up the story. what is the problem, what are the stakes here?
it sets up the emotional foundation that pulls a reader's heart along with their mind to the idea at hand.

spend the entire day / week / however long it takes until you set up the Intro well. trust me, this will be worth it. amen.
