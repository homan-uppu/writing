seriously.
it's a core aspect of the right lifestyle because it literally prepares the body and mind for deeper meditation sessions.
that's the right priority.

need to optimize for this.
this doesn't necessarily mean run to the shala and practice there. being able to have a strong self-practice is critical to maintaining the practice through your life.

start the practice here.
build up your self-practice.
make this the focus.
