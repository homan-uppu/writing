all of my blunders stem from not being sufficiently mindful.
sufficient mindfulness requires sufficient concentration, which goes hand in hand with sufficient mental balance. all are connected.

mindfulness is the only antidote. and the practice is the best way to handle it.

the practice turns the mind into an exceptionally strong weapon that is under your control. must continuously hone this skill.
