i believe animations would drastically improve presentation quality.
i want to take the time to craft exceptional animations that present each concept well.
e.g. 
- how the Network token operates.
- a full example of a fundraise, selling equity later, capital gains redistribution, etc. with very specific numbers (i.e. premoney / post money valuations, price per share and how that changes over time - e.g. the user creates a viral demo of a project & the price per share skyrockets).
	- potentially an interactive way to show this.

this white paper will certainly be an "application" of sorts. 
publish it on a domain.
version with GIT.

amen.
