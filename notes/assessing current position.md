1. get feedback on the essay.
	- i believe i have a solid draft of an essay to send out for feedback. i do want thorough feedback from 2 people who i would consider to be great writers / thinkers / communicators. how much is this worth? up to $500. that's what i'd be willing to pay - if they're abroad. if in India i'd be willing to pay 10k. there has to be some folks in India that fit the bill. no? consider the publishing approach: keep publishing ideas and build a brand around it. get into making videos as well... - need to think this through. it might also be overkill and may actually slow me down. but i won't know that until i experiment with this... i don't see any other way.

		- Raghav and any friends that he may have
		- Ravali and her network
		- ?? focusing on India makes a lot of sense - there is incredible talent here (scarce, but it exists), and you would def be able to afford them.
		- Pranati - she would def know some folks as well.
