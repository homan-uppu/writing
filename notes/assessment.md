there's a sort of dopamine **feedback loop of progress** that i'm missing entirely right now. this process isn't sustainable if you don't have that dopamine loop somehow (OR: you ascend beyond it with a serious practice). don't bank on "ascending" this basic human requirement. you need to design a system to give you some wins - and those wins need NOT be external validation... they can simply be pieces of work that you're proud of. or even clear progress on something that you know will work.

while the overall process may be hell (which it naturally will be), the moment to moment must be enjoyable, even pleasurable. otherwise, you're not following natural expression. the "enjoyable" will likely be quite challenging. no doubt about that. but it's the kind of challenge that your subconscious loves.
### current state
- personaltoken.vc communicates the project somewhat well, but can be a lot more powerful.
- the manifest is partly there, and it has clarified my underlying motivations, my underlying mission: **to maximize the world's natural expression.** the personal token is one of many projects that can fit into this.

### other:
 - i'm not managing my health well enough. that is my bottleneck at the moment.
