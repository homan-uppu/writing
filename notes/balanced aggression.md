actually, don't even need to use the word "aggression"... it doesn't describe what i want to represent.

the more balanced the mind is, the more sharp it is, and the less it's inhibited, held back, by the notion of the "self": the fragile ego that's afraid of being judged, of rejection, of looking like a fool.

the best way to transcend that ego is to practice. the path is the antidote to suffering, and being held back by yourself is a major source of suffering.

the more calm and balanced the mind, the better life becomes, and naturally, the better your results are in any endeavor.
