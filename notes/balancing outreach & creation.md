timebox the creation. my feeling right now is that a third of your time should be on creation, while the rest is dedicated to outreach.

this is a good starting point.

in other words: dedicate the first part of the day to creation, and leave the outreach to the night: since that's when the target audience will be up anyway. you can be ready to respond as they reply.
