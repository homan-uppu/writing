## decisions
1. **rent monthly** or get a long-term place set up?
2. **agenda for tomorrow** - critical day, need to maximize what you get done. - make it dense.
3. **goals for the week**

---


## week goals
1. have a place set up to grind well, cook well, and in good proximity to the Yoga shala for a daily morning practice - which i will start this week itself - no need to wait on this.
2. get a **solid draft** of the essay complete (as best as you can get it without external feedback. this is the foundation for the work you're going to do for the next couple of decades, so get it right! and take all the time you need). i want to be able to ship for feedback by e.o.d Saturday. i do want an editor. this is super important. find the right person. ideally in BLR itself so that you can meet them in person on a weekly basis.
3. think through & perhaps get the following set up:
	1. **research in public** (figure out how you're going to organize and publish this information) - get this set up and start diving very deep into 
		1. start crafting the PersonalToken spec.
	2. **people DB** - i must figure out the best set up for this. there is no need to reinvent the wheel unless there is a compelling reason to do so - there are already many tools out there to make this happen.

## re. rental

**reasons to rent monthly:**
- no up front costs to get things set up. - cooking, laundry, internet, etc.
- no up front time investment to get things set up.
- leaving is quick and easy.
- you can still buy a stellar chair, use it, and park it somewhere if you choose to leave for a period to Hyd and come back (or you can even just ship it). so yeah, it gives you the most flexibility.
- have all the cooking utensils you need to cook.

**reasons to rent long-term**
- even if you leave in 3 months and lose all of your security deposit (though you likely won't), a long-term stay would be more affordable than blowing 50 / 55k on a monthly place, AND you can customize it to your needs.
- the space remains minimal - you would just have a desk, chair, and you would sleep on the floor. this is the perfect set up. i'm actually not a fan of having more furniture than this.
- blazing fast internet... you can actually just operate on 5g from what i can tell. there's no need to get an internet connection tbh. 5g seems to be blazing fast from what i can tell. (can avoid burning money on an internet connection).
- stability - no need to worry about where you're going to go in a few weeks, etc. you just plant here until you achieve escape velocity.

it all comes down to the level of commitment: are you going to stay here no matter what and figure it out, or do you think you might be going back to Hyd after some time?

take a strong commitment. as strong as you possibly can. think it through and decide. i don't like this approach of moving every month or so. it's not that productive to keep moving this often.
