i've decided to invest in a "lab", where I will invest in my exploration for the upcoming year. a stellar set up with absolutely everything i need in order to be highly productive.

this investment is necessary. do it. you won't regret it.

but, the 3 drafts have to be what i consider ready to publish (minus the visuals and executing on the site ofc). the words have to be there. i should be able to send a Google doc of the essay and get feedback from an editor. this will take time. perhaps even another month or so based on my current pace. but, i have no option. i'm not going to leave this place until i have the right foundation.
