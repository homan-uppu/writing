the first thing to do is put yourself back in the obsessive state of mind: you need to become one with the area of study. become intimate with it again. that takes some good foreplay. give it the time & space to grow. and stick to it without distraction. keep bringing yourself back to it.

this is the foundation for my take-off.

everything you do, do it well.

**build a good working rhythm.**  prepare for a long, long grind. there are no quick, overnight results. great results are the outcome of long, sustained, patient effort towards something.

by working rhythm i mean being physically sharp as well. go on the regular long run through OU, Yogasanas, etc. in fact, i could even just take my mat to OU and do some yogasanas in nature (in the eng college ground or elsewhere). - build this momentum. don't get stuck at home. get a solid run (level 2 cardio) this eve. keep it short and slow, but get it in. you cannot afford the body to get weak. go for a run at 5pm. going into nature on a daily basis is extremely important. and i must also condition my heart well.

don't think about *when* sufficient momentum will arrive. that is not in your hands. just do your work exceptionally well. that's all you can do. amen.

repetition. just stick to the same exact process every day. and grind hard. that's all that you have to do.
