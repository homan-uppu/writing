now that the foundation is set in place (more or less), what are the ways to really enhance the delivery of the story?

- grainy video background of some subtle movement. perhaps nature. subtle, natural, blur effect so that the hero text is legible.
	- https://www.humans.design/
- light border animating like a photon:
	- https://www.fey.com/features/portfolio - the initial shimmer / border lighting on the component in the hero.
- lighting.
	- e.g. the beautiful center lighting for each feature in: https://www.fey.com/features - that's really well done. i wonder how you can do that for light mode.


at the same time, i think it's wise to not overdo the effects. keep it fucking simple: https://family.co/ - is an incredible well done site, communicates the value prop and the product exceptionally well, and doesn't have all the "extra", which is actually really nice imo.
