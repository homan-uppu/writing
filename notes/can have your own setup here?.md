i think that can work out.

desk chair internet and a way to make my own chai, (and get quality ingredients: e.g the milk they use here is the Amul milk carton, not the regular nonsense watered down milk you generally find here).

with quality ingredients and a space to grind hard, i think i can do absolutely great work.

there is literally 100mbps internet right here. that is as fast as you need internet to get serious work done. i'm serious. you don't need anything faster than this. that's the truth, whether you accept it or not.

you could have a stellar setup with 10k / mo burn, as well as another 20k up front costs (for a solid desk & chair setup). and that's all you need.

the diff in quality of work from 100mbps to 300 / 500 / 1k is meaningless. there is nothing that you will be doing that will require such bandwidth. you're not making videos yet, and EVEN if you do, 100mbps will be enough bec. all it means is that you wait longer for it to get done. the problem with cell data is that it's spotty - and many times, waiting itself does not work (gets disconnected, etc.).

and i believe you can get steelcase, etc. to deliver here. it's all a matter of money. this place is extremely well connected by road. you can get anything shipped here. (don't over-invest until you're absolutely sure).

so yeah, if you want to make this the long-term base for as long as it takes to achieve escape velocity, it is completely do-able. you can get incredible food in this area cooked for you with great ingredients, not an issue. air is pristine. nature is heavenly. there is absolutely nothing lacking here.

if it gets cold, go on long hikes to warm the body up. drink chai. absorb sunlight during the day. winter is only a couple of months. no big deal seriously. buy a heater if you really need it. there are so, so, many ways to make this work. this place makes a lot of sense. but you do have to be really careful about plastic burning folks in the vicinity. it could get pretty bad tbh. be cautious about that possibility and vet thoroughly before getting any place.

make this call on Dec 1. done. until then, work hard to achieve escape velocity. make each moment count.
