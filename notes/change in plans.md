instead of deep, deep meditation, i'm going to focus more on setting up the right lifestyle, and grinding on writing. i want to make this more worldly productive, while doing significant work in establishing myself in Sila, Samadhi, Panna.

this is not the phase for a deep, deep meditation practice. that will come later. i need a much stronger foundation first.

i'm also going to start gunning for generating money. i feel really guilty right now - as if i'm sort of escaping from the world, instead of taking up my responsibilities. i genuinely want to do good work for the world as well as build my own wealth. there will be a time and place for my serious practice - once i've established a strong foundation of Sila, Samadhi, and have built reasonable wealth.

this is my new plan, and yes, this place works fine. deal with the smoke. adapt. you'll be fine. amen.

OK, this is actually a significantly better typing position. amen.
