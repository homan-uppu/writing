The greatest cause for the failure of a group is complacency. We are our worst enemies.

Complacency is a natural reaction to success. In order for the Network to last, it's not enough to have the right design & implementation. The most important factor designing a culture that never becomes complacent.

Unfortunately, I suspect this is a near impossible task because balance is elusive: the mind is either paranoid or complacent, and never at the optimal. Anyone who has done anything nontrivial understands this truth of the mind experientially.

Therefore, in order to build a Network that lasts, we must strive to reduce the barrier to compete with us. What would this look like?
1. Open source code. Anyone should be able to "fork" the network and spin up their own version of it quickly.
2. Make it easy for users of the Network to move to a competing network, or even operate in multiple networks simultaneously if they want to.
