far too many wandering, unserious, addicts meandering around life trying to "find the path" or some other nonsense. the serious ones are exceptionally rare. i actually find the most ambitious founders to be far more on "the path" than hedonistic, aimless, wanderers that plague the path.

i'm honestly a bit disillusioned. the seat of ambition really is SF eh? even when it comes to the practice, perhaps SF is where the practice will take hold the strongest? Nah, that's actually impossible.

i've decided: i'm out of here. these envs ain't cutting it. besides the internet here sucks.
