you are wrong that a fast internet connection is a bottleneck. or that not having a great desk / monitor set up is holding you back somehow.

the only bottleneck is the quality of ideas that you have.

the truth is that being in this nature is helping rejuvenate your mind and body in incredibly powerful ways. Gangamma is working her magic. and this place and system is improving the quality of the ideas that you have. you can't deny this impact.

this is a powerful opportunity to reset your system. you must give it time. patience is necessary.
