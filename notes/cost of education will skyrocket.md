Many people think that AI will help democratize education by enabling everyone to have a high quality education for cheap (or free). But in reality, the cost of the kind of education that meaningfully improves someone’s chances of becoming good enough to create economic value will skyrocket.

The more complex the skill, the more difficult and expensive it becomes to effectively train for that skill, and the fewer great teachers are available to teach the skill. There are many who can effectively train factory workers and even software engineering in a pre-AI world, but how many can effectively teach someone to be a good enough content creator such that they can make a living from creating content? Very few.

The more complex a skill is, the less you can follow a predetermined set of instructions to become good enough at it. A decade ago, you could learn a programming language, a software framework, have a couple of example projects in your portfolio and land a job. Today, you would need to have a knack for what to build, a strong design and product sense as well. It’s incredibly difficult to train the latter - heck most professional software engineers with decades of experience still suck at these skills.

Those who are capable of effectively teaching / mentoring for highly complex skills are rare, and their time is worth far more than what most students can pay for. For example, a teacher who can improve someone’s chances of building a successful startup, or creating viral content by even 5% would be able to earn millions on the market, why would they teach a student for any less? Another way to look at it: since outcomes are extreme, successes are larger, and therefore the value of increasing the chance of success by even a small factor is incredibly valuable.

The converse is also true: in a post-AI world, a teacher willing to teach for something a student can afford to pay for is almost certainly not a good enough teacher who won’t be able to impact the student’s outcomes at all.

Therefore, in a post-AI world, paying for education doesn’t work because most will not be able to earn it back (no room for average), AND because the cost of the kind of education that does make a difference will skyrocket.

Without a new way to finance education, opportunity will be further concentrated in the hands of those who have the wealth to afford the best education, and who can afford to explore various things to find their unique, differentiated, talent that they can hone to create value in the world. Without a different system, the billions who will be riddled with debt will not have the space to tinker, and explore to have a fair shot at creating value in the world.

- need to connect this with differentiation and excellence - i.e. mapping it more closely back to what the economy wants.
