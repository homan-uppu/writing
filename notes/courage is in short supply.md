robert greene:

There are two kinds of failure. The first comes from never trying out your ideas because you are afraid, or because you are waiting for the perfect time. 

This kind of failure you can never learn from, and such timidity will destroy you. 

The second kind comes from a bold and venturesome spirit. 

If you fail in this way, the hit that you take to your reputation is greatly outweighed by what you learn. Repeated failure will toughen your spirit and show you with absolute clarity how things must be done.
