this phase may last longer than you may want it to. design a space and system that will last.

it's OK if burn is somewhat high if it enables stronger execution.

is this a decision that must be made now or can it wait?

**it should not wait because:**
- getting into OMAD is top priority. i need an environment without food so that it aids my fasting process instead of requiring me to constantly exercise willpower (a failing strategy).
- comfort and love from family kills ambition.
- it's time to get back to socializing. meet interesting people. build connections. in person. staying here isn't conducive for this. it's time to get back into the real fucking world.
- you will be lulled to death here. you'll be significantly held back. when you stay with fam, the immature child in you manifests more frequently... this isn't healthy at all.

what if you wait a week? nope. trust me brother, this is very, very unhealthy. you must move out. but... hear me out: what if you gun for traction in the next couple of weeks? you can then head straight to SF... 

it's abundantly clear that i must move out. the only question is: where?

i'm not feeling like moving is the best thing and that i should rather just focus on writing the whitepaper and muster up whatever strength i need to do so.

but, that's the thing! you shouldn't have to "muster strength"... the right system will put the mind in a state of natural expression which will automatically write the white paper. that's what you have to strive for. i don't want a few evenings of inspired work, i want a system with which great work is a natural, consistent byproduct. amen.

i also can't stay here because there will be events and get-togethers coming up. this is not possible.
