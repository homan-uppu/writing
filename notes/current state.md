personaltoken.vc website communicates the gist of the project in an extremely mediocre way. it can be made 100x better for sure. but, the quality of this website is NOT the bottleneck at the moment.

in order to get personal tokens to the world, i need to find the initial set of users: the ambitious youth willing to raise capital by selling equity in their outcomes. only after you have such people (supply), will the demand see value in investing. without supply, the demand side isn't going to show interest because they don't even see the "value" of it all: the value comes when the see an individual worth investing in, who wants to sell equity in their personal token. only then will the emotional craving in the investors' subconscious minds is triggered. it's only then will they actually *understand* the value of personal tokens and how it opens up a completely new kind of asset to invest in.

therefore, trying to convince VCs to "invest" in a personal token without knowing the individuals they can invest in - is a complete waste of time. 99.99% of VCs are extremely fickle sheep: they didn't get to where they are by changing the world in a meaningful way, but rather by climbing up the ladder in a safe way.
