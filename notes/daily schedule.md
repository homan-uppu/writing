i'd like to sit more than i'm currently sitting. i don't think fully focusing on writing is optimal. let's lock in a schedule and stick to it. you will never regret a moment you've spent sitting. maximize it, at least during this phase when you have the opportunity to check out and practice.

6am - 7am: **sit**.
7am - 10am: write.
10am - 11:30am: **sit**.
11:45am - 1pm: write.
1pm - 1:30pm: lunch + walk.
1:30pm - 3pm: **sit**.
3pm - 8pm: write.
8pm - 9pm: **sit**.

this feels more reasonable. try this out for a couple of days and re-asses.
