get a great spot.
create the right set up.
don't engage with the world. just do your thing day in day out.
be right next to OU. go on a daily long, long run through the park.
cook your own food. make your own chai.
get a solid workout in every single morning.
that's all you need.
it will likely just be at Thatha's. can get some kind of 2 wheeler to quickly get to OU **every morning for a long, long run.** - i'm talking about something like a 10k every single day through OU. early in the morning. and just a long ass run.

BUT: i already know that it pales in comparison to the nature that my body is experiencing right here. this place is incredible. a hike up this mountain is 10x better than even a 10km run through OU in terms of its impact on my health.

and just look back at this year... where have you been the most productive? i would say right here. as you ramp back up your meditation, it will become clear to you.

spent the entire year in Hyderabad right, what did you get done? just a bunch of explorations that you didn't see through. right here, you're nearly complete with a draft of something you've been meaning to write for a long time, you designed and built a stellar personal site. you have clarity on what to explore / build next - i.e. the research. you've accomplished more during this one month here than you have for 10 months in Hyd.

there is no chance that Hyd is the better environment to grind. all it has is a bunch of baggage. seriously.

and ofc, staying with parents is the absolute last thing i'd want to do.

i'd much rather grind hard here, build a great foundation, and go straight to the lion's den in SF. i really, really don't want to have to deal with fam and their frivolous day to day nonsense. every day feels like a vacation - horrible vibes with which to do great work.

yeah, no matter how hard you think, you know deep down that there is no better place. fact. focus on the health. longer meditation sessions. long daily hikes. disciplined diet. this is the right priority. stick to it.

also, i don't ever want to live in a couped up apartment. i want to be close to nature: for long walks, hikes and runs. that is my groove. that is how i make it easy for me to be healthy. design the environment, and health takes care of itself. when health is taken care of, work takes care of itself. it's all a chain reaction.

**the only refuge you have, the only place you can call home, is within.**
seek refuge in the Dhamma.
the Dhamma can only be found within.
there is nothing else to be done.

ramp up the practice right here.
double down.
do great work.
transform your life.
