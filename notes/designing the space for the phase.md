i'm entering the idea socialization & intense research phase.

what does this phase look like? and how to best optimize for it?
this phase may take 1 month or 1 year (or longer). i'm really not sure.

i need:
- fast, high speed internet.
- a great desk setup with a monitor and chair that supports many hours at the desk.
 - nature in surroundings. reasonably quiet.

i want:
- a running / hiking trail that i can hit every day. that alone should take care of the majority of my health.
- access to a healthy meal (with variety), daily.

the house hunt will honestly be quite annoying, but i honestly can't think of another way to do this. don't have the infrastructure that i want here. I don't ever want to live in Hyd again. especially at home. i absolutely hate it.

you could honestly find a 20 - 25k nice, small, apt in HSR layout, invest in the setup you want, rent a scooter as well, and make it work for the foreseeable future.

what's holding me back is all that up front work and expense, only to move to an area that honestly doesn't give you a quality of life proportional to how expensive it is. the same dough in Saigon goes much, much further if i'm being honest. everything premium in saigon is absolutely incredible quality. can't beat it.

all you need is a laptop stand, good keyboard and mouse, and you're all set. seriously.

and you can more than manage < $1k in saigon.
alternatively, you could do Tokyo as well for 3 months. that would be a massive burn tho tbh. Saigon is significantly better.

yeah, this situation kind of sucks if i'm being honest. there is no good place to do long-term. it will be a constant moving around of sorts.

it does again seem like Hyd is the best option. Lol. the only burn you have in Hyd is finding an excellent place to be based out of. but that becomes a very unnatural life: there is nowhere to move around and about. unless you're in DD colony. yeah, DD colony just feels so much better than anywhere else in Hyd.

i think DD colony would make the most sense if you ask me.
