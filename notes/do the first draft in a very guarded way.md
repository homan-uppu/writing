don't present the full idea even to the technicians you work with. give them a higher level abstract that they can work with (with reference samples to work with). only you should have the end-to-end picture / vision.

why are you thinking of this approach?
- i believe the best work comes from a singular creative vision, unpolluted by over-collaboration. even when there seems to be collaboration, the greatest works are still driven by a single person.

guard even the first cut of the video (if you choose to make a video that is - which i think you should. it's an important form of expression, one that is required to infiltrate the subconscious. there is no other way.).
