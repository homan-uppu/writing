focus on shipping actual products that actually impact the world in some way. make your "personal brand" or whatever secondary. in fact, make ignoring your personal brand part of your personal brand.

your work is above you. it's more important than you. the ideas that you share with the world are what's important. not you.

internalize this truth. be guided by truth. be a vehicle, an instrument, for the truth to use to infect the world. an idea spreads as fast as light illuminating a dark space.

this process is simple. pour yourself into it.
