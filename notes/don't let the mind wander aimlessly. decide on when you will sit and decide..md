until the white paper is complete, i'm going to be right here in Hyd.
i'll go to BLR to start the outreach phase. i'm going to do that from cafes, etc. and meet people in person, as i build a strong yogasana practice at the Shala.

that's it. quite simple. quite straightforward.

till then, laser focus on knocking out the white paper. that's all that matters right now. knock it out, start aggressive outreach, start the content creation engine, and get this idea to the world. amen.
