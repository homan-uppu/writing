there is no growth until you actually fucking feel it.
you must absolutely bunker down assuming that growth can take months, if not years. this is the mindset you require.

ofc, operate each day as if the breakthrough will come today / this week! that will keep you moving fast. but be extremely patient re. the results. they may (and likely will) take time to arrive - if ever. the results are not in your hands - only your actions are.
