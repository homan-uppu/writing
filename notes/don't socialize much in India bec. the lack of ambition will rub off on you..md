it's better to be completely isolated here.
even the crowd in BLR that i see at cafes, etc. are really not pushing the envelope of anything because they are not building world-class products that any human being, anywhere, would want.

in fact, for that kind of ambition, you're more likely to find that in the streets of Hyderabad where there are filmmakers in places like Manikonda dreaming of movies that will challenge the likes of the James Camerons of the world.

the only world-class Indian product that i know is films. and you're in the heart of where the most ambitious filmmaking experiments are run in this part of the world.
