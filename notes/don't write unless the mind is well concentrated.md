develop a good sense for level of concentration in this moment, and whether that is sufficient for the work you're trying to do.

don't work on demanding tasks (writing, creating, brainstorming) until the mind is sufficiently concentrated. even if it takes hours to achieve such concentration, you have no choice, because 1 hour of work when the mind is well concentrated and balanced is more productive than millions of hours of work with an agitated mind. in fact, they're incomparable because you will never achieve the quality of output that a calm, collected, concentrated mind can achieve.

so you have no choice but to keep meditating until the mind is well concentrated.

fight the 5 enemies on the path to concentrating the mind. eat less. drink more water.

practice Jhana my friend.
