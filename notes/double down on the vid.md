i sense that there's something irrationally true here.
that, investing this much resources into the video isn't logical, yet it feels like the right move. in fact, it IS the right move. i know it, but i have no explanation for it.

it's the kind of truth that is above logic.

but, i'm going to try and explain why this is the right move - because i can't do great work without my intellect on board.
- amplifies my strengths:
	- my "edge" is me. the way i can communicate ideas, tell engaging stories. the medium of video provides a much larger surface area for my strengths to shine. i'm multiple orders of magnitude more convincing via video than i am in text.
- entry point:
	- this idea lacks an "entry point": an easy to understand starting point that gives them the "activation energy" to dive into the details (i.e. the white paper). the video would be an excellent entry point to absorb both the idea, and the intent behind it.
- long-term brand power:
	- in order to own the relationship with my supporters (esp since many will be on the younger side), i need to communicate my ideas through videos.

**and lastly, you don't know the potential of this medium until you try.** even if it doesn't work out, the learning will be invaluable...

this means that i'm not going to do ANYTHING until an excellent visual presentation is complete. amen. establish the foundation of the brand, of yourself, of the idea, and then get the ball rolling. done.
