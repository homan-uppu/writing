i'm apprehensive about traveling to someplace like Japan, etc. for a work-cation because the infrastructure to grind hard isn't that easy to set up. you're going to have to get an entire routine set up again, and the routine is where the magic is created.

what i want to do: set up an incredible creative studio - eventually in SF / LA, and in HYD for now. use the space to do spectacular work.

honestly, at this stage, the location does not matter. do whatever you need to do to put yourself in the right (most productive) mental state. that is all that matters.
