the email capture starts off as just a button with "stay updated" within it.
when the button is pressed, it turns into an input with the placeholder "email", with focus, and a smaller icon button to the right of it with the following icon:

<svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

<path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M12.6738 8.43445H0V6.69664H12.6738L7.20582 1.22863L8.43445 0L16 7.56555L8.43445 15.1311L7.20582 13.9025L12.6738 8.43445Z" fill="black"/>

</svg>

when that icon button is clicked, it transforms into a check mark.

therefore there are 3 states to this. make the transitions animate with framer-motion.
