- get through the /why
- think deeply about the overall design. make it consistent, cohesive. experiment with it a bit.
- knock out the early access form and integrate it into the site.

i think i'm ready to knock this entire thing out in this session. 
make it fucking count.
ship the site tonight.

i want to pull an all-nighter. when you feel tired, sit. but, no matter what, ship this site tonight... and set up outreach. amen.

- the more time i spend on X, the more confident i become that i'll have many people to reach. and i realize what i need: a tool to "capture people". create a beautiful people database - that is what i need rn. that is the missing link.
	- build this well. consider getting that cursor compose thing to see how it works. just speed up development.
