a crystal clear product direction that is backed with solid thinking (expressed in writing), fleshed out designs, as well as a clear technical spec for how i'm going to build the MVP.

as soon as i achieve this, i'm going to leave and set up shop wherever makes the most sense. and i'm going to invest in a great work set up - don't hamper productivity one bit. execute well. execute hard. and most importantly, execute in the right direction.

in fact, if possible, i would start execution here itself: flesh out the designs for the landing page as well, and start reaching out to potential users just to bounce ideas off of them. and remember, you can reach anyone in the world via email / twitter DM. only when you are severely restricted by executing here should you leave.
