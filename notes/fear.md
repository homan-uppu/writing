# Overcoming fear.

What can I do?

Accept it. This is the most important first step. By far. Accept it. Don't run away from it. It is a hidden volcano that is starting to rear its head.

Be compassionate towards yourself.

You have this tendency to beat yourself up over things. Try to stop. Be compassionate, understanding. Treat yourself the way you'd treat someone you meet on the street who's going through similar anxiety attacks.

Cut yourself some slack in the same way you cut them slack. Amen.

Second, I want you to lean INTO the situations that give you anxiety. In a slow, controlled way.

I think this phase of isolation is negatively impacting my mind. It's making a bigger deal than it should about ANY social interaction.

Therefore, I want to spend more time with people. I want to collaborate. More frequently. All the time if possible.

What can I do about this?
1. OMAD (Strict)
2. Cut out all caffeine (even tea).
3. Sit more. Include one evening sit every day (at the end), and another hour in the afternoon.
4. Read Dhamma.

Remember, there is no quick fix. It's all a gradual progression.
Pick a center, and use it for internal work.

And: start engaging with people in person. Absolutely.

Yesterday I had an anxiety attack.
I failed to ground my mind in sensations and remain balanced.
I was very agitated in that interaction.

I definitely have this underlying problem. And it's gotten worse in the past 2 - 3 years.

What happens:
- Heart rate increases.
- Breathing becomes difficult, almost as if I'm struggling to get the air that I need.
- I can't think straight because my body is literally in panic mode.

It even happened just now.
What is going on!??!

This is absolutely ridiculous. What is going on?

I remember this happening back at Salesforce as well.
In big meetings, if I'm unprepared, I have a reaction.

I remember this vividly. And I remember not liking that feeling at all.

Maintaining a calm mind is absolutely key.
