The audience for this white paper is broad: the users of the idea, as well as people interested in investing in this idea itself. This audience will be well versed with technology, and are reasonably optimistic about the future.

What I want a reader taking from it:
1. **Excitement** from witnessing the future: the reader can see how the world will be shaped by personal tokens and see why it will be incredibly valuable.
2. **Clear understanding** of how it works - from the perspective of a user (i.e. if they were to raise capital through personal tokens, or invest in someone else's personal token).

the white paper is divided into 3 main chapters:
1. intro
2. how it works
3. implementation
each chapter has multiple "sections" within.

Feedback priorities (ranked):
1. **Intro**: most people will NOT get past the intro unless it is spectacular. Nothing else matters if the intro doesn't work.
2. **Is the core idea resonating**? E.g. like at the end of a novel, or a movie, is the core emotion the artist trying to convey registering in the audience? In our case, does the audience feel like they grasp what a personal token is and feel good about what it will bring to the world? (note: this is about feeling, not necessarily about internalizing specific information).
3. **Organization**: 
	1. should there be more sections in a chapter / should sections be moved around?
	2. chapter / section naming: are there simpler words we can use to express a concept?
4. **Chapter**: 
	1. do the sections unfold in the right order? does it feel like the story is building, or does it feel like a bunch of disparate pieces stuck together?
	2. is the chapter missing something important (e.g. you have an obvious question you think many will have, but it's not even addressed)
5. **Section**: 
	1. (same as chapter, but with respect to the concepts within a section).
6. **Minute details**: making a paragraph simpler, making the words flow more nicely, replacing overly complex words / complex sentence structures with simpler ones, etc.

The better your feedback is, the more you will force me to write / edit this white paper. 
I welcome (and expect) ruthless, brutal critique.

These are suggestions, feel free to ignore any / all of it. The most important thing is to help me achieve the goal (generating excitement & clear understanding), the process does not matter.

Thank you.
