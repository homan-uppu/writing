this is kind of frustrating.
i never had this earlier. this is a new feeling. a new kind of phase. hmm...

but, i'm DEFINITELY moving. there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that it would benefit me greatly to be in a new, more challenging, environment. one that requires a great deal out of me every morning through a serious yogasana practice, meditation practice, followed by an exceptionally strong working day.

decide this now.
