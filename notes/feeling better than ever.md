I don't know what it is, but i feel better than ever before. is it the nature? the people? the food? the fasting? the energy? a regular practice? a combination?

i'm going to keep at it. lean into this area. learn the language, the customs, the culture. become a part of it and help out however i can. i sense that i'll be here for longer than i had initially anticipated... but, ofc i'm not sure.

i'm also more convinced that if i move from here, it'll be straight to SF. there is no need to set up shop in an Indian metro to grind before leaving. i can achieve the momentum i need from right here itself because the momentum will be gained from crafting great ideas, and collaborating through text with future teammates.

this place reminds me of Mushishi. And, what's interesting is, i visited this place 12 years ago soon after watching Mushishi for the first time. perhaps that's why there's that association in my mind. beautiful.

one day i'd like to create an anime film set in a village similar to this one. with the same bridge and trail leading up the mountain.
