no more thinking about whether to be here or not.
i'm going to be here until i have a crystal clear execution path.
it's that simple.

i much more writing, designing and creating to do from right here. all i have to do is continue to build on, and capitalize on momentum.

there is no other place as pristine as this is anywhere in the country. and even the ones that do exist, will be incredibly difficult to find.

therefore, buckle up and lean into this place.

if something is not "working", then fix it and make it work the way you want it to. it's really that simple.

and you also don't even need the internet right now... working off of data is more than enough at the moment. when the internet related work picks up, that's when it's time to get better infrastructure set up.
