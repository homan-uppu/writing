## notes
- daily morning Ashtanga. it's a 10 min jog. i'll want to jog there, and walk back. majority of the path is off of the main road. perfect. if need be, can buy a super cheap bicycle or even just auto it back on the days you have to rush. right next to gonative, where you can eat your daily one meal.
	- stick to no coffees. just the teas at home, and one meal at gonative. this should suffice.
- might need to buy a mini fridge? but why?? 
	- quit milk. just drink water based teas - and you already have the kettle. this is perfect. you can get one cup of coffee per day at Blue Tokai - a 10m walk.
	- do groceries every single day - just enough for what you need for that day. if you choose this path, buy a simple cutting board, knife, and just use your pressure cooker to cook everything at once. that's all you need to consume. ingredients can be high quality.
- continue to do laundry the way you've been doing it. wash the clothes with water, and leave out to dry.
	- massive downside is not having the sun to dry it. using the sun to dry clothes not just to dry, but also to disinfect. that's important. there are probably ways around this, will need to explore.
