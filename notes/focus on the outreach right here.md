trust that you will get in touch with the right people.
trust that you will find your community.

loneliness is a feeling that can only be combated within, not by running towards people.
it's entirely possible to be lonely in the midst of many people.
just as it's entirely possible to be at peace in complete solitude.

don't conflate solitude with loneliness. they are independent.

i reeeaaaallllly don't want to travel anywhere.
i'm in the middle of something, and i want to see it through right here, right now.

i'll meditate to settle my self.
i'll exercise to settle my body.
i'll eat right.
i'll grind.

that's really all there is to it. no?

go to the housewarming. now i feel guilty. lol.
do that one event and you can grind here for the rest of the time.

it really is that simple. amen.
