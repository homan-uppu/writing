i can easily spend the next few days fleshing out the comment system, or i can just focus on fleshing out the idea itself.

need to be careful what i commit to here.

i should NOT start with any sort of comment system until i've sufficiently socialized it with a few people. there's no point going wider until you can engage a set of early "users" first.

so, approach it from this angle.
