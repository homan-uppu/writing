i really dig the aesthetic of the L2K. the minimalism, the understated design, it looks incredible. it's kind of saying: "my flash is in my work, not in my looks"... and i vibe with that message. nothing shiny, flashy, overstated. humble, minimal, simple. designed to create and do nothing more. not a status symbol, not something that elicits envy when looked at by the average person. like a well functioning, bland colored, Tesla rather than a Lambo / Ferrari.
