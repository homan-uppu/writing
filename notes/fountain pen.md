I honestly don't think anything can beat the Safari.
E.g. I honestly don't believe the L2K is better than the Safari. I don't remember the writing to be that much better (if at all - because i actually like the grip on the Safari better than the L2K).

Perhaps Safari with the gold nib would be an improvement, but even that i'm not sure... the steel nib i have writes perfectly fine.

the most important things to get right are the paper, ink, the font size you write with, and the grip on the pen (and it shouldn't be too heavy, or fat). that's about it from what i can tell. the nibs from the good brands seem to all work well enough, and it makes no sense to pay a stupid premium for a "smoother" gold nib or however they market them.

i see myself sticking to the Safari for the foreseeable future. once i get some dough, i'm going to reward myself with a top of the line fountain pen (and its copies) and just use that single pen and model till i die. that's about it. keep it simple silly.
