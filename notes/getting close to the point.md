I can see the path.
1. **Create stellar assets** for the vc learning essay. Absolutely stellar. Keep them in Figma for now, don't worry about the implementation in the code just yet. I want to visualize these before editing the prose because this is also a component of understanding well. It will impact the prose.
	1. Realized that I know the feel I want to achieve - and yes, it will be on a light bg - not dark as it is now.
	2. And yes, the animations will be critical.
2. **Craft an incredible essay**. Distill the concepts down into the simplest forms possible. Make each fucking word count!
3. **Editors**. I want to run this by 2 editors who I think can be great. Ask P, and Allie for help? Actually, their friends would be absolutely incredible for this! (Jenny, etc.).
4. **Outreach DB**. Make this very specific to this essay. Compile a list of 100 people (just Notion it for now) and categorize into 3 waves: first for the unrecognized talent who would be able to give me thorough feedback quickly, and as the waves progress, it will be less likely to hear back.
5. In the meantime: continue to write the other essays you have lined up: seeking truth, age of individual, natural expression. maybe all of these won't be publishable, i'm not sure. some may just be one paragraph or so - and they can just go into notes.
	1. EVALUATE WHETHER THESE ARE THE RIGHT ESSAYS TO FOCUS ON! Might make more sense to double down on the personal token angle and start putting together the research required to make that happen.

This is sort of a content creation engine. This is a required process at the moment. Just have to keep at it. It might last an entire year or longer.
