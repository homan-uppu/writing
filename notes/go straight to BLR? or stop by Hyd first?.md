if Hyd i can pick up clothes, electronics, etc. but you don't need ANY of that. you have more than sufficient clothes, and you're just going to go do Yoga - and you have a solid pair of shorts for that already.

you need NOTHING from Hyd. avoid Hyd like the plague. get your own space and setup and get to the grind brother. get to the grind.
