what are the options that i'm not seeing? what are some high agency paths?

- find a way into SF sooner rather than later? but why? why not have a solid idea + execution before you get there. this just feels like something you "should do" without really thinking through why.
- build a venture firm that exclusively invests in personal tokens, and find the people to invest in. once you find those people, build out the product that enables you to invest in them. you can play this big: i.e. by just launching as a VC firm / school, etc.
- take a serious content path?
