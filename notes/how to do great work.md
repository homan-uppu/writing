1. ship when it's great, not on some predetermined schedule.
2. train the mind to be collected, balanced, concentrated. you cannot even see the best possibilities without such a mind.
3. do what excites you the most. don't settle.
4. aim bigger. always operate at a level that feels uncomfortable.
5. don't over-game things. the quality of the "product" is most important. get this right. the rest will follow. most people over-game without having a product that is game changing. gaming is easy: there is a proven path to doing it. creating a great product is difficult. there is no formula.
