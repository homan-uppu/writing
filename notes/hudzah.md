hey, hope you're doing well.

i'd super appreciate your feedback on an idea i'm working on: a financial instrument ("personal token") that enables an individual to sell equity in their future ownership of companies (and other personal tokens) in order to raise capital today. 

personal tokens incentivize discovering and enabling talent - especially talent that is overlooked & underrated - creating the economic incentives to democratize opportunity. 

i believe that raising capital through personal tokens will become the most popular way to finance learning (as opposed to taking on debt), and that future teaching programs will pay students to train them in exchange for equity in their personal tokens, instead of charging money to teach. 

if you have the time, I'd super appreciate your feedback on this idea. thanks!
