all i want to do is train my mind.
to rise above all the crap i have going on inside.
i know this will take time. it's not a 3 month, or even 6 month kind of thing. it'll take a year or so. as i was writing that previous sentence, i realized it's a lie because i have no fucking idea "how long" it will take. it will take as long as it takes for you to drop the notion of "taking time". 

one thing is certain - i don't want to socialize with the usual suspects. i'm not interested in absolutely any kind of get-together.

every group i see, i see a fundamental mis-alignment between what i'm seeking in life, and what they want. that's actually all i see when i see other groups. and then i fear that by spending time with them, i will start to become more like them (which i certainly will - like i said: mimetic tendencies run incredibly deep).

i only want to spend time with very serious seekers of truth. who have lost themselves in their absorption. and, the only way i can connect with them is if i rise to their level. there is no other way.
