i can't see any other way. i need to confront some deeply rooted fears of being accepted, in order to even be able to get this out into the world.

the path is clear:
1. manifesto
2. plan to change the world with a new economic system.
3. second order consequences of the new system. (show the future - sci-fi).
4. call to action: how exactly we will build this future.

--> circulating the written version of the manifesto is the starting point. don't wait to do the whole video thing before you get this to the right people. start the conversations sooner rather than later. building the right core team is everything.
