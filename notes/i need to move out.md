this is ridiculous.
i literally don't feel like i have a space to operate out of.
i want complete isolation during this phase. i don't mind having people around me, but i definitely don't want to interact with them... i don't want to socialize during this phase.

ideas can be very tender and weak in their earliest stages (which is where i'm at right now). they need to be protected. socialization pulls the subconscious to take paths that others approve of - whether you realize this or not. this is why the best ideas come from relative solitude: when the mind has the space to be itself without being bombarded with subtle cues and nudges from others to be how they want you to be (which is incredibly common and prominent which only those who don't take the well trodden paths can feel viscerally).

settle the mind with the practice. make this decision with a calm, collected, mind. done.
