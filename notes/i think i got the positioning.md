pitch this as a product that ALREADY EXISTS!
treat it as a fleshed out company that has already figured out all of the implementation details and is actively onboarding users.

this is the only positioning that works. you have to "fake" the product to be taken seriously by the market and to attract the right kind of criticism that will help ground this idea in reality, and actually make this viable.

you need a very crisp, to the point, confident presentation of this idea as if it already exists. this is a fundamental shift in the positioning.

the asks then become:
1. i'd appreciate connecting me with a crypto lawyer who is well versed with securities regulations and how they intersect with web3.
2. would you be interested in investing in personal tokens? - if yes, have a conversation and sign them up for the waitlist. figure out if they already have some people they'd want to invest in.

this is it. have a direct, simple approach. add a "contribute" page as well to appear as if you are ready to build a team.

this makes COMPLETE sense. amen.
