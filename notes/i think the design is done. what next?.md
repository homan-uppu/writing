designing anything more is overkill at this point.
ok, so doing the site, or sticking to Gdocs? that is the age old question...

definitely create the site. it absolutely makes sense to organize and present your ideas in the best way possible, also curated in the best way (not just based on chronology). control the narrative.

once you lay the foundation, just keep writing, researching, and fleshing out ideas. this is the way to go.
