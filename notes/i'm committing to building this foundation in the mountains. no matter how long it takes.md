this foundation is critical. need to muster up this determination. must give the idea the space to manifest itself.

must also find a good place for meditation. a regular spot that i go to daily to sharpen my mind, to expand its awareness. i want to sit in the same exact spot. it could even be in the room, or in the tent next to the room. wherever it is, keep it consistent, and slowly, but surely, ramp up the number of hours you spend concentrating the mind. go deeper.

the "foundation" is more of a feel than it is a specific requirement, because the specifics may change at any moment.
