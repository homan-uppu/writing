all i want to do is write.
nothing else matters.
i'm going to make the other aspects of my life boring, and just focus on doing my best work. period.

i'm just going to keep publishing my thinking. keep writing. this is the foundation. of course, i'll eventually enter into the filmmaking side of things, but i feel a strong desire to just continue writing for now. trust the intuition. just keep writing.

just keep at it.
