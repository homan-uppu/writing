i want my set up to be able to grind hard when i want to. a productive set up (i.e. fast internet and good seating) is more important than this nice rural environment when it comes to getting work done.

all i'll need to do when i get back to the more productive environment is maintain an extremely strong meditation practice.

the only question to answer now is where?

back yourself and go to where the action is: BLR. This is the most ambitious city in India, and you're bound to find the right talent to amplify any vision you have. even if you're trying to dive into web3, there's some serious talent there that you could meet in person if you wanted to. but, once again, you're not at that point yet. there's a lot of writing that i need to get through first. that's the most important starting point.

yeah, but are you at the stage to start burning capital? i'm not sure about that. that's my primary concern tbh. will you back yourself, or will you keep giving yourself "time"? the other thing is: i'm not going to "connect with" or socialize in BLR at all. and if i do need t do that, i'll set up meetings and then take a flight over. but honestly, if i'm at the point of taking meetings, the flight will be straight to SF. so yeah, BLR / SF / any place has no benefits to offer until i have something meaningful to give to the world. and that meaningful something should be done in the place with the best cost / productivity trade-off. i.e. my work environment has to be brutally productive, without holding back whatsoever, but the location etc. should be such that i naturally don't spend much to sustain myself there.

that being said, lifestyle does impact productivity. being able to slip away to 3rd wave to crack a tough session with some matcha in my hands could be dope. and taking Ashtanga Yoga in person is far better than remote (which i hate tbh.). as i'm playing this out in my mind, i think setting up shop in BLR is the way to go.

but, i shouldn't be going to 3rd wave, etc. that environment is incredibly dangerous: once again the mind is pulled towards the activities of the world, whereas i'm really trying to find deep isolation. this idea, and this path, is incredibly fragile. small influences can heavily shake it up. i can't afford to give it that kind of chance. and that is the same exact problem with home

the frustration is real, but i have to work through it. this work demands that i work through the frustrations.
