it's the one thing that everyone seems to be an expert one, which likely means that most don't know what the hell they're talking about, AND, most won't be open to a balanced, objective decision on what the actual impact will be from policy changes.

what i've realized is that it's become a lot more difficult to think for yourself. far too difficult. when the mind is distracted by media left right and center, incessantly from the moment you wake up to the moment you sleep, you can't think deeply about anything!

using technology productively is becoming more difficult because it's becoming more addictive and distracting.
