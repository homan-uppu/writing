you can buy everything you need to make this place work and it will STILL be way cheaper (and healthier) than moving to someplace like Hyd / BLR

ok, what would i need to make it work here?
- winter clothing (i'm sorely lacking at the moment).
- 2 heaters.
- solid desk.
- great chair.
- 300 mbps internet connection.
- laptop stand
	- https://www.amazon.in/PLIXIO-Adjustable-Rotating-Ergonomic-Compatible/dp/B0CN2LGZ67
- mouse
	- 
- keyboard
- ethernet to usb-c. (get dat wired connection).

what it will cost:

up front:
- 5k - for winter wear + heaters.
- 7k - for desk & chair.
- 25k - for laptop stand, keyboard and mouse.
--
about 37k to get this set up.

recurring:
- 3k - internet
- 6k - rent for office space
- 8k - food. (splurge on this. get the good Amul milk, not the local packets. go have your meal at Anand Ganga. Eat high quality food, in limited quantities).

--

about 15k / month. totally reasonable. better than anything you'd find at a metro.

this investment only makes sense if you're going to be here for at least 3 more months. if you're planning on leaving before that, then it makes no sense and you're better off moving to a metro: Hyd / BLR / Saigon / etc.

so that's the call to make. need to think it through. take a couple of days to decide.
