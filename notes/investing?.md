i think there's a case to be made for investing around 10k in under-appreciated assets such certain technology companies / crypto.

actually fuck it, this is too low to play these games. start investing when you have > 100k surplus. not needed right now.

be **more patient**. focus on 0 -> 1. don't worry / over-index on things that don't directly correlate with 0 -> 1. having 10 - 20k more doesn't fucking matter at all. you have all the wealth you need in order to explore what you want. so don't get distracted by the temptation to make a "quick 100k" or whatever. there is no such thing.
