that's what the entire game is about. tame it.

> it is difficult to control the mind because it is agile, swift, and quick, moving wherever it pleases (or desires). however, a mind that is tamed and disciplined brings happiness and well-being. (Dhammapada 3.35).

for a well tamed mind, any place is the best place.
for an untamed mind, even paradise is lacking and frustrating.
