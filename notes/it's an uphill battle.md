this part: the getting the idea to the world part, is going to be a brutal, possibly long, period in which you'll feel like you're pushing a large boulder up a mountain. if you're not prepared, and strong, the process will wear you down.

be prepared for months, if not years, of outright agony: of doing everything in your power without seeing any tangible results for your inputs.

you'll need a sort of self-delusion during this phase: you must act with the excitement and energy that you would if you believed the results were just around the corner, with the understanding that the results will not come quickly.

you can't let the truth that results will take time to dampen your intensity in the moment.

this is the art of doing difficult things over long time horizons.

there's no way around it than to do this.

strengthen your resolve. do great work. it's time.
