a new mode of operation:

in fact, there's not even a need for internet.
the internet is such a huge time sink. you can get lost in it and not know where your time went. it's such a destructive force - especially when you don't have a clear execution path in front of you.

therefore, it would be wise to completely shut out the internet until you have execution clarity. it's not healthy. deal with the boredom directly. amen.
