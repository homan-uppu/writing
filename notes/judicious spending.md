be a bit wary of setting up shop in BLR and splurging. You don't have as much as you think you do. And you definitely ought to save money.

From a cost perspective, I think HYD would be significantly cheaper: you have all the equipment, it's just a matter of moving it. BLR would be a lot of buying things from scratch. But, honestly that's not that big of an expense tbh. I'm quite minimal in a sense. Can't imagine furniture, etc. costing more than 30 / 40k.

There isn't that much sense in going to BLR except for burning money if you ask me my honest opinion. You can get a similar set up elsewhere. But, there is a massive advantage in having the Yoga shala right there. I think that shala in and of itself is a huge value add.

Total burn in BLR:
- 40k - rent (don't go anything cheaper, it's not worth it).
- 5k - house help, etc.
- 20k - food, occasional coffee, etc.
- 15k - buffer / misc

Total 80k / month.

80,000 / month for a year is roughly 10L

Plus investing 2L into a solid work environment would be 12L.
Plus a rough 1L deposit, plus 1L furniture stuff = 14 - 15L.

I'd also want to have a few L to be able to spend on products - i.e. the users should feel the impact of each rupee spent. and having 5 - 10L as a sort of backup to be able to spend on such experiments would be useful.

On this note, I'd also like to have a budget for an editor. I think it would make a difference. And i would like to collaborate in person. E.g. meet my editor once a week at a cafe to discuss my current essay. that would be absolutely ideal tbh.

Basically, you would be spending all the dough on living. That's a stupid way to spend it all eh. BUT, if you do get the rent down to 20k, nah, you'd still have burnt through a big chunk of it.

And, there may be unforeseen medical expenses that you always want to be in a position to deal with. Allocate 5 - 10L for this bare minimum. I don't want any crippling surprises on this front.

My point is that i don't know how long it will take to get results. And i definitely don't want to be in a position in 12 months having absolutely nothing to show, AND have burnt through all of my dough. I'm confident this won't happen, but I don't want the pressure of this happening to be playing on my mind.

Try this: if you can get a solid internet connection set up here in Uttarkashi / Netala / Siror - all your problems are essentially solved! Right? You'd then just need to order the keyboard / mouse on Amazon and just get down to work.

If you stay in Siror / Netala - your burn is essentially < 20k / month, even if you include internet / other expenses. that's very healthy.

So yeah, a move doesn't quite make sense. And yet, i feel that it does. you can give yourself a worst case: e.g. 6 months, and if nothing is happening then you bail and go extremely frugal (i.e. move into a tier 3 town / city) and grind it out with much lower burn.

or perhaps this desire isn't based in any useful intuition, and i'm just craving better infrastructure (even though I really don't require it at the moment). fascinating.

nah, i think the infrastructure would def help. having a stellar space to grind out of for the foreseeable future. fast internet, keyboard, mouse, solid desk, and excellent chair to sit in for long durations, house help and perhaps even someone to cook for me. all of these would be great for productivity. and you can have a downside prevention: if you burn 6L without having a clear path to making money, you exit everything and move to Hyderabad. that would be the plan.

but, there is a problem with this plan: the lack of flexibility. let's say for some strange reason you have a video shoot in Hyd. what then? if you double down in a place, you sort of lose flexibility in executing ad-hoc. you lose the option of guerrilla tactics. so yeah, be cautious. be careful. know what you're giving up.

and know that this writing path can be an extremely long one. it might not pan out even in a year. have the necessary fear towards that situation. and if it takes longer than a year, what will happen is that in 6 months the pressure will start eating at you from within and you won't be able to execute in an open-ended way. the mind will be pulled to doing things that can take off quickly. and as soon as you start thinking short-term, you've lost the battle.
