no more fucking excuses.
- you don't need a better "place". this place is fucking excellent.
- you don't need better "weather". learn to heat up your body at will.
- you don't need better "internet". mobile data is more than good enough for what you need to do right now.

it is absolutely pointless to move now and try to find a place that meets your needs. there is no such place except for SF / Tokyo / something of that quality. nothing else will cut it.

so, just suck it the fuck up and make magic happen.

concentrate the damn mind. put it towards the task at hand. and see it the fuck through. let's go.
