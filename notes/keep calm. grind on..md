seriously, there is nothing else to be done. just keep at it. i know this angle will be absolutely massive. make it happen. this is a tough phase. no doubt about it. just have to stay very persistent. that's all you can do :).

the thing is, i've found the mountain to climb. i know what i'm betting my career on. it's time to fall in love with the process and just keep at it, to lose myself in it. that's what's required.

nothing else to be done. nothing else. it's time to embrace the grind. amen.

remember, the difficulty is not in the work, it's in the mind. ramp up the meditation hours. concentrate the mind to be well seated in the present moment, calm, relaxed, smooth.

this is a test of your mental strength. train the mind to rise above its cravings for short-term dopamine hits. you need a mind that will last this process.
