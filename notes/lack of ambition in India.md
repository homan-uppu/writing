that's what i feel and see around me.
better to be entirely isolated than to be surrounded by un-ambitious people that will pull you down to their level of ambition.

i can't find ambition anywhere. even the ambitious sages, monks and nuns of the previous eras are nowhere to be found in the Himalayas.

there is only one domain in which we are world-class ambitious, and that is storytelling, which is concentrated in Hyderabad: SSR, SRV, Venky Atluri, Sukku.

these folks operate at world class levels, and really do challenge the best visual storytellers of the world.
