make this direction your primary objective.
be so absorbed that you think of nothing else.

train the mind to have natural absorption in whatever it wants to.
this is an incredibly powerful skill to possess.
it's worth it to train it.

don't get distracted by others' paths. 
every individual is unique. 
comparison is useless.
