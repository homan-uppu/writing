a distracted mind is a weak mind.
strengthen the mind through strong concentration.
in fact, don't even get to writing until and unless the mind is sufficiently concentrated.
become better at gauging when it's there, and when it isn't.
and hold the bar for minimum concentration high. make it take effort to achieve and sustain. that's what's required to succeed. make it happen.

you have to remember your training!
