- HSR layout (BLR)
- Netala

i don't want to go to a new place because it takes longer to get everything set up. focus on places that you're familiar with, where you can get the necessary infrastructure set up relatively easily.

Netala
- can definitely get internet, solid desk and great chair set up relatively quickly. food is already taken care of: just go eat at the home stay / find someone in the village to cook food for you every day.
- weather is going to be excellent starting a week from now, so you don't have to worry about that at all.

i'm really not feeling the hustle bustle of BLR. at the same time, Netala doesn't make sense because i'll burn some time getting the infrastructure set up. you'll waste at least a couple of days getting things set up.

the most sensible thing to do is to stay put, and start a daily running practice up again so that i can get into nature and work out my body in the way that it needs to be worked out. even a long walk will do wonders. going to OU makes a huge difference. if having a vehicle makes sense, just rent an Activa or something (or even better - just use your old one for a little while).

the next best option is to go to BLR for a couple of weeks again. but damn, i'm def feeling some inner resistance because i know that moving doesn't solve any problems. all of my challenges are internal, and hence that is where i must do the work. needlessly moving around is simply more distracting than anything else.

go on a run today. meditate more. eat well. grind. nothing else to be done. amen.
