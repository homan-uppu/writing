that's my learning here. you take the same mind with you no matter where you go. as long as you have a clean environment with some fresh air and sunlight, you can make any place work.

"making a place work" depends on how strong your practice is. that's all that matters.

if you can dedicate 6 hours a day towards a serious meditation practice, strictly eat one meal a day, and also do your yogasana practice, you will take control of your destiny. there are no two ways about it. get excellent internet connectivity, desk set up, etc. and give yourself a great shot at winning the long-term game. go get it.
