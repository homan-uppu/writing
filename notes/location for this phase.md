i don't want to budge from this spot. i don't want to spend money unnecessarily given i don't know how long this phase will last. i need to be exceptionally prudent & cautious. i can't afford to be hovering near 0 ever again in life. treat each rupee with immense respect. there's no other way.

if parents need it, i need to be able to offer financial support. 15L is a lot of money and it can go far.

it's going to be painful being here. there's no doubt about it.

grind from right here. don't spend a rupee unnecessarily. make magic happen. go straight from here when the time is right. amen.

it doesn't matter how uncomfortable it becomes. how many unwanted words you have to hear from people around you. you must stay put and execute. you're also not too far from Mokila... you can make a trip there for the final move when required. it would be nice to leave India only after parents are settled into their new place, safe and secured, and not living in someone else's home. i want to see that and leave with that sense of security in my heart. amen.

and tbh, it'll probably take that long for me to build my momentum anyway.

grind and make it happen. done.
