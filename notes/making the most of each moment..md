it's time to radically transform how i spend my life.
my current approach isn't cutting it.
i need to radically transform how i approach life itself.

i'm going to think through what i want, and then i'm going to make a plan to get what i want. it really is that simple. all it requires is will. a will to act.

### what's not going well
- my health is rapidly deteriorating. my sleep schedule is crap. i'm eating wayyy too much, and food that is cooked with old vegetables, and utter garbage when i eat out (which is far more regular than i'd like it to be). without a healthy body, my mind will not be able to operate at its prime. this is turning out to be a massive problem.
- secondly, i feel incredibly isolated from nature. when i'm in nature, i feel great. but, unfortunately, that only comes for a little bit of time during the day. i'm not getting enough sun. i feel trapped in this place.
- my practice isn't going well. i had a couple of weeks of reasonably solid practice, only to whither away. the practice is difficult to prioritize when you feel that work has momentum, but you absolutely must prioritize the practice. nothing else is more important.

### on lifestyle
- **strict one meal a day. no calories outside of that single meal**. restraint in food enables restraint in all other skills. and even that meal mustn't be too much: just fill 2/3rds of the stomach. that's all. occasionally skip that meal as well (to have a 48 hour-ish fast).
	- this is the single most important change in life. it radically amplifies the practice as well (because a fasted mind perceives reality more easily, and settles in concentration more easily).
- strong meditation practice. start each day with the morning cleaning routine followed by a 2 hour meditation session.
- reading scriptures (for inspiration, motivation): focus on the Suttas, and perhaps the Gita if you feel like it.
- time allocation.
	- 6 hours of meditation per day... at the very least you must hit this. it doesn't matter if you get nothing done for the rest of the day.
	- 7 hours of sleep per day.
	- 1 hour of walks, wandering, pondering + 1 hour of exercise. you could combine these and go on a nice long hike up a mountain / hill every day (assuming it's in your vicinity).
### on location
- definitely moving out of Hyd. there's no need to be here. if you're going to be here, be closer to nature.
- the mountains are a great place to be right now. the weather there is perfect. the nature is pristine (in the right locations - thought the traveling between places in the mountains can sometimes be a pain in the ass).

look, the lifestyle goals are cool and all but how to best design life to enforce these constraints?
- go the Himalayas? that feels like the best place to implement this lifestyle.
