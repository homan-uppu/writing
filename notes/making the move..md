i'm sold on requiring better infrastructure. it's important.
these are the options i have. will finalize one as i inch closer to needing to leave.

## NETALA
- buy some warm winter clothing.
- buy quality desk and chair.
- rent a small room by the riverside (should be very cheap: 5 - 6k / mo.)
- get an internet connection.
- order laptop stand, keyboard and mouse from Amazon.
- grind away. you will have everything you need, minus the weather - which will suck for another couple of months.
## ASIA NOMAD
- Start with **2 months in Saigon** and then evaluate. i'm very very down for this. a combination of cafe grind, and working out of home.
	- can buy tickets, visa fee and also book Airbnb through HDFC visa, shouldn't be a problem.
	- Convert 2L to USD and use that for spending for 3 months. if you really need more cash, find an American there, send them USD somehow, and get some VND from them.
- and then you have the option of coming back, or even going to the states if need be. you basically play the game one month at a time.

i would MUCH rather spend the dough traveling through Asian cities than spend on some "luxurious" nonsense in Hyderabad. a couple of months in Saigon to start things off, and then keep moving. Thailand. Taipei. Kaohsiung, Busan. etc. and hence i'm apprehensive about creating a "base" for so long in one place.

## HSR BLR
- get a solid 1bhk in HSR layout in a standalone building. - you have to invest in the right place, else BLR becomes shit.
- daily Ashtanga - just surrender to the process.
- daily morning work sesh at 3rd wave.
- will need to bathe with drinking water. shouldn't be too bad. just buy one of those 50 rupee 20L cans. probably works out to < 1000rs / month. even if you get the 100 rupee one, that's at most 5k / month. would be totally worth it.

BLR is going to be cheaper than Hyd because the requirements for the space are more stringent in Hyd. 

as long as you're cautious and you take good care of your body, you should be able to thrive in the environment. i don't foresee any issues at all.

but, you have to remember, you're basically paying a massive premium just to live in the city. you're basically paying to absorb pollution. fascinating.

## HYD DD
- can get a nice flat in DD colony and hit OU every morning for a run. but, this feels like moving backwards, rather than forwards. there is nothing inspiring about this place. and yes, i do want to spend a morning sesh at a cafe. i want that. i'm not going to deny that.

## HYD HIGHRISE
- blow dough on the most luxurious 1 / 2bhk you can find in the heart of the city: Gachi / Hitech / Financial districts. pay so that you don't have to worry about absolutely anything. everything is taken care of for you. all you have to do is grind.
- whatever infra investment you do for this space, you can conveniently dump it in Mokila before you bounce.

## NOT DOING
- spend a month in Mokila to get some momentum and then do an Asia trip? no. i don't want to spend any time at home. that's a disastrous plan. you will slowly be lulled into death. do NOT even consider spending time at home no matter how tempting and "logical" it may seem. it will not work.
