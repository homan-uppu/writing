I want this essay to be world class.
I want it to near-perfectly encapsulate my intuitions about this topic.
I want it to be visually stellar: in all senses, and especially in the quality of the diagrams / animations (if any).
I'm going to spend however long it takes to make this a reality. I will solicit feedback from multiple great writers before finally publishing.
I will hire an editor to help review and edit. - this too is a process. The best will be exceptional, so take the time to hunt them down. The same process you would take to hunt down a great engineer. And try to go through your network as well.

One incredibly well crafted essay at a time.
That is what I'm going to do.
This is my craft for now.
Will consider / think about other things when that time comes.

This is a strong commitment towards quality. And not settling for anything less than what you feel is great work.

I also deep down want to be a great writer + orator + communicator. This is a direction that I want to evolve in. Something within has been tugging me in this direction for a while.s
