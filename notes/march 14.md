**personal brand:**
- start work on the first video. keep it very short and simple. script it out. and bring it to life.
- update X profile pic, banner, and username (lowercase "h") all at once since it will trigger another review. you'll have to wait until the review is complete to do this, but have all of the assets ready.
- make an X pinned post for the concept of personal tokens with a nice visual / something (i mean, think about it, prob not necessary for this first post. can iterate on this later).

**outreach:**
- get the outreach message right.
- build list
- reach out.

be in a position to **start reaching out** to people by 7pm (that is 6:30am in SF - you'll get the early risers, and i'd bet that most of your audience are early risers).

godspeed. move fast. meditate more.
