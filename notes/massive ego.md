Common hiring "wisdom" is to find people with "low egos". 

What this means in practice is you'll get people who don't care enough about their work and will allow their ideas to be trampled by others even if they believe their ideas are better - i.e. people who prioritize not rocking the boat when the boat should in fact be rocked.

And it's not even that these people have "low ego". There's no such thing as "low ego". There are only a handful of people in the world that I'd characterize as having low or no ego, and they live in ways that you and I can't even comprehend. Therefore, "low ego" people are usually people with middling egos who likely lack the self-awareness to see their egos.

People with middling egos are poisonous. They'll settle for the measly prestige that comes from titles, promotions, raises, how many people they manage, etc.

I want to work with people with egos so large that they are fine being misunderstood and even villainized today as long as their work is celebrated in history books centuries later.

I want to work with people with egos so large that they rise above petty politics and status games because they know that the people who play such games won't even appear in footnotes.

I want to work with people with egos so large that if they believe that their views are too mis-aligned with mine, they'll quit and start their own competing company not necessarily out of spite, but because they can't help it: their egos require them to succeed massively, and they can't be stopped by anyone - including their teammates.
