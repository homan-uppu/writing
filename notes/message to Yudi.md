Bhai ji, i would like to take the last cabin (furthest away) for 8 nights (until April 9th). if it goes well, i will probably extend for another month. i would also like to take a small desk and chair into that room for working. is this OK for you?

regarding the rate, does: 1500 rupees per day = 12,000 for these 8 nights, with food additional charge work for you?

if you prefer we can also discuss in person once you are back.

thank you.
