I'm creating a financial instrument ("personal token") that enables an individual to raise capital today by selling equity in their future assets: i.e. their stakes in companies and other personal tokens that they will earn through their lives.

I believe personal tokens will be the best way to finance learning. Instead of financing learning through debt, those with potential can raise capital through their personal tokens...

I'd appreciate your feedback on it: https://personaltoken.vc.
