audience:
- a highly ambitious 16 year old ready to build the future.
- highly ambitious 30 - 40 year old investor.

which story to tell:
1. why the *world* needs personal tokens. - a more general, "political" story about the future of the world that lays down my philosophy about how the world is evolving an why.
2. just directly enabling the best talent without the overarching story.
