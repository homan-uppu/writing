i love it precisely because it embodies the "rough", "incomplete", "intermediary" feel that it has.

it puts my mind in a sort of ease. an ease that comes from knowing that it doesn't have to be "perfect" before sending it out to others.

and there's just something... neat about it. maybe because all of my coding fonts have been monospaced and so there's some kind of subconscious association with it.
