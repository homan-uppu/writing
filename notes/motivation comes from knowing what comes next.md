ok, so you knock out the essay today. so what? what comes next? have clarity about this so that you increase the motivation required to see this essay through. without a clear set of next steps, this essay feels meaningless.

look, the next steps are as follows:
1. find an editor to read and offer feedback on the essay.
2. start writing a **spec for a personal token**. think through how to launch one and get traction for it. what are the features of such a personal token. and why? basically write a memo for what you're going to create, why, and how. use sharp, powerful, decisive language.
3. with both in place, reach out to folks you respect in this space, and get their feedback. this first essay is a sort of prequel / motivation essay for the spec.

i really like the angle of using the first essay as a reference for context, while pitching the idea of the personal token.

this makes sense.

grind harder. make it happen.
