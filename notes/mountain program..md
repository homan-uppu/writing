**mind**:
- 4 hours of meditation per day. 
	- start the day with a 2 hour sesh - after your walk to the viewpoint.
	- one hour in the aft (around 2pm?).
	- one hour in the eve to wrap things up.
ramp up the meditation hours as time goes on.

**physical health:**
- one solid meal a day - lean towards mostly (dal, rice, 4 hardboiled eggs, a vegetable).
- 1 long run (experiment this late afternoon with a run on the road. see how that feels) + 
- 1 short hike (to the viewpoint) during sunrise. soak in the sun after that.

**duration**: 
- start with one solid week: April 2nd - April 9th.
- add one week at a time.
- (you could also consider: **committing for an entire month** and extending the internet connection to the cabin that you stay at).
	- it's OK to spend some money on this if it helps you build a strong practice, health and productivity. amen
