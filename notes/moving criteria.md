1. solid white paper published to the right people and i feel an initial pull.
2. a video presentation of the idea (very high production value - that i'm going to shoot and craft right here in HYD).
3. raise some money.

---

with these in place, change up the environment.
but, honestly, even then, i just want to go straight to fucking SF. nowhere else makes sense for me. and only go when you can rent a 5k / mo place (home + office space that others can work out of as well) without batting an eye. else, don't go...

that's it. no more distractions. cut to the chase. get this project off the ground.
