most people there are there to chill. what you need is solitude, not once again mixing with the unambitious, not again building social ties with people with mundane desires. that being said, there are still incredible opportunities to practice in solitude there: e.g. on the hill on the hike that i would have sessions at, or even the Bhairav mandir, were excellent meditation spots. but, you have to remember, that only very, very few people are actually very serious in their pursuit. you'll meet all sorts of people there. a highly collectivist society of sorts. incredibly money minded. i mean, all the regular shortcomings of human beings can be found there as well. it's not some "heaven on earth" from that perspective.

why not focus on shipping something from right here to start with? perhaps the isolation is actually getting to me and i don't feel that productive here. not necessarily a good thing if you ask me.

you can do a lot more here than you think you can. remember that.
