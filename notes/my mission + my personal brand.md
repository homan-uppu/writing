### Mission
To enable more people to discover, accept, and follow their natural curiosities.

I'm going to approach this from multiple angles:
- create & scale personal tokens to enable individuals to raise money to follow their curiosities.
- art that explores the struggle we all have between our natural selves, and what we think we should be. art that shows the possibilities of the human experience. art that helps each of us unbind social conditioning so that we can find out what we really are.
### Personal brand
Let the personal brand emerge naturally from obsessing over the mission. As you work hard towards the mission, what you obsess about and how you express yourself will craft your personal brand. Don't over-index on this and try to craft a personal brand through premeditation.

Premeditation is the antithesis of natural expression. Don't premeditate.
### Daily momentum

- tweet something every day. - ideally something you're researching. make X your research log - something you use to think out loud.
- follow the right people and reply to something every day.
