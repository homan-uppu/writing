# PURPOSE
### practice
i want to train my mind in the Dhamma.
i want to train Sila, Samadhi, and Panda.
i want a much stronger mind. a mind that can lose itself in what it is doing. a mind fully absorbed in what i want it to be absorbed in.
i want greater control over my **monkey mind**.

i want a mind that can be at ease in difficult situations. a mind that isn’t a slave to its anxieties, fears, regrets, ruminations.
i want a mind that is seated in the present moment, aware of what is happening, without reacting to anything.
i want a mind that has range. range to imagine anything. to surpass any man-made imaginary boundaries about what can and cannot be done. to surpass my own beliefs about what i can and cannot do.

my mind is far, far from where i want it to be. it’s reeling. it’s like i’m operating a car with a completely blown out, flat tire. it’s moving sure, but it’s not going that far, and there’s no way it will last the journey i want to go on.
### focus
i want to have no conversations, no distractions from what i want to focus on.
the main problem i have with living in midst of others is the conversations i'm bound to have that i no longer want to dedicate any time towards.
### physical health
my body is hurting. it's rotting on the inside. i can feel it.
i'm overeating. i'm not exercising the way i need to be. i've dropped my ashtanga yoga practice.

i've dropped the practices that keep my body healthy. if i don't adopt the right practices, my body won't be healthy enough to support what i want out of life. physical health is incredibly important. it's time to prioritize it.
### writing
my mind is craving to say something. i don’t quite yet know what it is because i haven’t given it the space and time it needs to actually communicate what it wants to.

i want to give my mind the space and discipline to be able to explore what it wants to, in depth.

my attention is fractured. i’m consuming far too much information than is healthy.

i’m incredibly distracted. i’ve lost my ability to focus on one thing for a long time. i’ve lost my ability to be fully absorbed in what i’m doing.

as soon as i get reasonably concentrated, my mind is pulled somewhere else: not towards a useful direction, but towards distractions.

my mind isn’t balanced or strong enough to be able to explore what it wants.

sometimes i feel the fear of missing out. sometimes i feel envy. sometimes i feel regret. and these feelings pull me away from exploring what i want to, towards rumination and patterns of thinking that prevent me from expressing myself the way i’m meant to.

# LOCATION

- Uttarkashi / Gangotri - during the Sadhana phase (and perhaps the later phases as well if conducive).
- Doon / Mussouri - for a more intense grind iff you need access to higher speed internet.
# SCHEDULE

### phase: getting settled. (10 days)
- give yourself about 10 days max to find the right place to execute this phase. during this week, try to sit at least 3 hours a day.
### phase: training the mind. (minimum 100 days)
- **5 day self course** / 2 days writing and chores (laundry, cleaning, buying ingredients, etc.).
- sole priority is **deepening the practice**, strengthening the mind, rebuilding attention, and building a healthy, strong body. in a world of distraction, attention is the greatest resource.
- need to train the ability to hold my mind where i want it to be. this is an incredibly important skill.
- daily Ashtanga yogasana session. at least on alternate days.
- write on the side. aim to publish something each weekend. but remember, during this phase, writing / publishing is NOT the main priority. some weeks, if you want to extend your self-course into the weekend, do so.
- you have a possibility to extend this by another 30 - 90 days if you want. let the future version of you decide this. but 100 days is the BARE MINIMUM that i'm going to commit to going into this. you must not break this.
### phase: work.
- i'm not leaving the mountains until i have the necessary funds to go back to the US for work. it will be **mountains -> Hyd -> US** once i'm ready. no other nonsense trips in between, etc.
- if, for some reason, you need access to faster internet in order to grind, you can move to Dehradun to set up a solid workspace. they have high speed internet there it seems.
- ideally, even if you move to doon, try your best to finalize the direction / - have a crystal clear plan before you come down from the mountains.
# PRE-REQS
- there is no pre-reqs. just go grind. there is nothing left to be done. the will is all you need.
- have a means to publish essays without much tweaking. consider defaulting to just publishing via Google docs, or just a Github repo of essays. though, i would prefer my own presentation. i do think owning the presentation is important, so yeah, i would like to work on my site a bit before "deploying" the first essay.
	- but, honestly, let your future mind decide this. this isn't a blocker. worst case, will just publish Google docs.

OK. I'm all set.
