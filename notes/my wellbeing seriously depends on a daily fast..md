some of my happiest days were in Uttarkashi. and i believe one of the primary reasons for that was due to my strict one meal a day: a powerful aid for the mind. it brought me great concentration and health.

my gut is incredibly off these days: evident in the aches, gas, and in general, its inability to handle things. i suspect my milk consumption is killing it.

from now onwards, skip the milk entirely. replace coffee with the matcha tea (with just hot water). try this out for a couple of weeks and see how you feel.
