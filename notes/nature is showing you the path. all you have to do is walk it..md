the next steps are becoming quite obvious.
not in terms of what exactly needs to be written / done, but rather the path to lean into and explore.
and that is all i need to have clarity on what to do.

in addition to writing essays, I'd like to write one to myself about what i'm going to focus my career on and why. it will be a high level theme / mission, and it's surely going to change over time, but nonetheless i think it would be a valuable, productive exercise for me to go through.

i'd also like to have something that i can check against when i'm deciding to do something. does it fit my mission or not?

i'd also like to be able to share with people close to me, to better explain why i may not show up to hanging out or other things. i want my friends and supporters to know what i care the most about, and why i'm doing what i'm doing.

write for your own clarity.
