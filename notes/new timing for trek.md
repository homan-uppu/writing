i don't want to go right after i eat.
can't go after 3pm bec gets dark and folks won't let me climb up to where i want to go.
so i guess it's either 3pm or before 9am (bec else it gets too hot).
could go at 8am post sit in the morning and grab chai on the way back.
or, just stick to 3pm. that should be fine. just don't eat the marie gold biscuits so that your stomach is a bit more empty.
