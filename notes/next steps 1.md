1. knock out stellar drafts of the 2 essays. (the best that i can do without outside feedback).
2. completed design for website, and the brand i'm going to build. if internet is troublesome, stick to text and sketches and remember what you imagine.
3. set up the right office space in the right city, with solid internet connection, and aggressively attack the direction. it will take time to build momentum. plan for a year of grind in the same place.

**this is all you have to do**. quite simple. quite straightforward.
