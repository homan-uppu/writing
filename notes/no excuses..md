can't leave until you achieve something that actually warrants moving. you're not there yet. there are a lot of iterations left to do. there is a lot more writing to do. not great internet is actually a pro rather than a con during this phase of early ideation and exploration. internalize this truth no matter how uncomfortable it makes you feel since you're literally just missing out on fast internet because it has become a habit / addiction, not something that you actually need. realize this!

only leave when you have a crystal clear idea of what needs to be knocked out when you leave! amen.

you have everything you need right here. even your seating arrangement is excellent. you have the perfect place to deepen your meditation practice. you have the mountains to keep you physically fit by hiking. you have a sufficiently fast internet connection to be able to flesh out and share your ideas with the world.

the only time when it makes sense to move is when you're actively building something that requires deeper technical nuance (e.g. a more complex app / video, etc.). but EVEN then, you can get quite far from right here.

somewhat extreme weather for a few weeks out of the year is probably beneficial to the system. it was what our ancestors had to deal with on their hunts through the wilderness, or when they bathed in these rivers at sunrise without fail. there was a sort of beautiful discipline and iron will that was formed by using the extremities of nature as tools to train the mind.

do what you want. follow the natural curiosity. design life to enable following natural curiosity.
