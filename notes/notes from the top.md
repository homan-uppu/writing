- To democratize opportunity as fast as possible -> optimize economic growth.
- To optimize for economic growth -> cultivate trust.
- To cultivate trust -> minimize fraud.
- To minimize fraud -> maximize ambition + reputation system that is negatively impacted if you misrepresent reality, and is available to the Network to see.
- Maximize ambition will be handled by the investors in the Network who are incentivized to only invest in the most ambitious.
- To create a strong, sufficiently decentralized reputation system -> incentivize truth seeking.

**The antidote to fraud is a culture of high ambition, and a system that seeks truth.**

Truth seeking for the reputation system.

Another super important point is that in the early days there will not be a notion of a reputation system, etc. because investors will just invest in people they have already discovered and know (perhaps via X / their network, etc.). In the early days, the Network's responsibility will be restricted to providing the core personal token functionality.

Aim

Trust

Maximizing ambition / Admission
- Leave it to the investors.
- Afford rights / voting to users depending on whether they have raised capital or not (or perhaps valuation), instead of just being in the Network (which can be done easily). This is important because the most important signal of ambition is being invested in. -> don't even this point rn i think. a later challenge to deal with.

Reputation

Fallback: courts
- A quick note on how

Synchronization
- this warrants a separate section because fact checking is for when the users say something that isn't true. synchronization is to figure out what the user has NOT said, but is true and relevant to their personal token valuation / capital gains distribution.
