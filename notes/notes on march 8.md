1. need to process this current state of mind. there is learning here, and a re-prioritization of what is important that is necessary here. i completely agree with Rajatta's feedback and i'm going to process it deeply 

only after the reprioritization, and after dedicating a day to the practice, only then get back to work with a calm and collected mind.

the main priority right now is honest self-reflection. there's something that was triggered in the past couple of days that i need to deeply understand.
