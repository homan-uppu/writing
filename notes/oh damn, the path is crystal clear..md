lean into the craft.

every word, every pixel is worth crafting with care.
in the age of the power law, details matter more than ever before.

it's ok if it takes a bit longer. once you ship something, it needs to stand.
building things that "stand" is difficult, but the only way to create.

i'm ok with taking as long as it takes (days, weeks) to lay an exceptional foundation and to follow the joy and excitement in my work. that is necessary.
