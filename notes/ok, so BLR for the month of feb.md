what it would look like:
- start the day with a solid Ashtanga yoga practice + long meditation session wherever you're staying.
- go to 3rd wave cafe (the one near Go native) to get a long work grind until lunch.
- eat lunch at Go native.
- go for a nice walk in the parks as you get the mind ready for the next sesh.
- Blue tokai for the aft sesh (possibly until 4 / 5pm).
- head back to where you're staying, get in another solid sit.
- go for a short walk, stretch the body out a little perhaps. some pushups, etc.
- get back to the grind.
- sit again. wind down. pass out. no more food after your one meal in a day. stick to water / tea.

that's it. simple. straightforward. nothing more. nothing less. hit the 4 hours of meditation per day, no matter what. that is the foundation for a strong, healthy mind that can do great work.
