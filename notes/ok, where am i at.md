the landing page is coming together.

it's going to take a bit of time, but you have to give it the time. why? because for a new idea like this, the greatest bottleneck in the early days is communicating the idea exceptionally well: simply, so that people get it. it's only when someone understands the product that they can see how to use it.

in addition to an exceptional landing page, i want to do more passes on the /how, and /why, and i want to write a short para on /contribute - create a compelling argument for potential teammates from day 1
