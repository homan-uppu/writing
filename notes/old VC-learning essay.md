Artificial intelligence will invalidate the business model of paying to learn by making all of our work more complex and creative. As our work becomes more creative, outcomes will increasingly follow a power law distribution: a few create most of the value, the middle class disappears, and most won’t make enough. When most won’t be able to earn money on a predictable, reliable, timeline, they won’t be able to justify paying for education.

In a world defined by the power law distribution, venture capital (VC) - _putting money in the hands of someone in exchange for a small ownership in the outcomes they generate (e.g. the companies they will create, or the assets they will own in the future)_ - will become the best way to finance learning.

VC means individuals will receive money instead of having to pay to finance their learning. VC best democratizes access to opportunity (relative to all other options). And importantly, VC scales in ways that grants and scholarships do not.

### Creativity and the power law

People claim that AI will create more jobs than it will take. After all, this has been the trend for as long as humans have invented better tools: every major technological breakthrough at first removes the need for certain professions, yet in the long-run creates far more jobs than it took. E.g. The printing press invalidated the need for most scribes, yet in the long-run created many jobs by creating a much larger market for books. Many people were eventually employed in the manufacturing, transportation, and distribution of books at a scale that was previously impossible. Enabled by a technological leap.

But, there's a truth underneath these claims: many of the new jobs created are often more complex and more difficult to get good at than the jobs that were made unnecessary.

[Complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_complexity) is proportional to how many ways there are of doing something, or even more technically: how many possible states you can end up in. Assembling a chair on a factory line isn't that complex: there are only so many ways (often 1) of doing it. Creating a Youtube video is highly complex because there are nearly infinite possibilities.

The more complex a skill is, the more creative it becomes. The more creative a skill is, the less you're able to get good enough by following a prescribed set of rules or guidelines for how to do it. For example, you can reliably train a large number of people to get good enough to work on a factory assembly line, but you can't train entrepreneurs, content creators, or artists such that most (or even many) of them get good enough. For these highly creative skills, the majority of those who graduate even at the best training programs will ever get good enough to make a living from it.

The power law dominates all creative fields:

There is no "middle class" for creative skills. If you make it, you make it big, else you struggle to get by. If most can't get good enough to make a living at any kind of work in the world, then paying for any kind of education will become a luxury that only a minority can afford, because most won't be able to recoup their investment in education.

There's also a degree to the power law: how "skewed" (TODO: see if there's a better term to use for this) it is towards the top. Generally, the more complex a task is (and therefore, the more creative it is), the more skewed the power law distribution is. Today, content creation is more complex than software engineering, and hence it has a more skewed power law distribution of outcomes.

The power law distribution seems to be inextricably linked to an insufficient median compensation. The more skewed the power law, the lower the median productivity falls. And in a world in which people generate wealth according to their economic productivity (most of our world), the median compensation also falls.

When I first observed that the median compensation falls as the power law increases, I was taken aback because it made it seem that the world was zero-sum: someone creating more value meant that they took it from someone else. But I also knew that these creative fields were positive sum: their overall markets have been growing rapidly. The pie is undeniably getting bigger. (note: insert relevant statistic). And in fact, more creators make more money overall.

Then I realized that what we consider "enough" changes quickly. When rich people buy expensive new products, those products often become so good that everyone starts seeing them as necessities, not luxuries. This gives the wealthy an edge. Even though average workers today can afford what used to be luxuries, it never feels like enough because our standards keep rising as technology improves.

In addition to this constant recalibration, there is still some element "taking from others". When a new product is created that is significantly better than what people already use, when people switch to it, the existing products do lose revenue. This also applies to content as well: when I find a new content creator covering the same topic as someone I already follow but in a way I find better, I'm more likely to switch over completely because I don't have time to watch both.

### Is the power law inevitable?

Is it inevitable that most will never make enough in highly creative domains? Or is it a temporary phenomena that we'll only see until our education becomes better and can once again train most people to be good enough? If it's a temporary phenomenon, then we won't see a massive shift in how education is financed... most will continue to pay to learn.

**From what I can tell, the power law distribution of outcomes is an inevitable feature of creative work.** There's no way around it (that makes sense). Of course, a government could decide to eliminate differences in outcomes through force, but they cannot change the underlying differences in how much each individual contributes towards creating value without getting rid of the tools they use to create. Yes, if you ban AI or more powerful computers, you can prevent your country or region from becoming more creative and thus preserve some semblance of the middle class. The Amish seem to do this quite successfully today. But most would not want to live in such a society.

The first evidence that shows that the power law is inevitable is to look at highly creative crafts that have been around for a while: writing, filmmaking, building startups. The power law has not only been strong in these domains for decades, **it's increasing** as technology gets better and as more people participate. If there was a training program that could raise the minimum productivity such that more participants could make a living from these skills, we should have seen some progress already.

There's also another interesting, albeit more technical, piece of evidence that shows that the power law is directly proportional to how creative the skill is, independent of the quality of training.

Let's look at two popular board games: Chess & Go. Go is more complex than Chess because there are many more actions you can take in Go from any given position, and you can end up in many more possible states. Therefore, based on how I’ve defined creativity, Go is a more creative skill than Chess.

If we compare the relative skill of the players in these two board games, we'll find that the power law is more pronounced in Go than in Chess. In other words, the best player in Go is much better than the average Go player than the best Chess player is compared to the average Chess player. And it's a smooth curve. I.e. the gap between 1 & 2 is greater in Go than in Chess, and so is the gap between 2 & 3, and so on.

What's also important to notice that the median relative skill in Go is lower than in Chess. Correlating to the real world in which people are compensated according to their productivity, it would mean that the mean compensation falls as the skill becomes more creative.

<ChessVsGo />

I really like this example because the games have largely remained unchained for decades, and most of the top players have the best possible training and resources, so you can't say that the power law only exists because the best had better training. Even with significantly better training by playing computers, and excellent coaching centers for the best players, we still find the power law distribution of outcomes. Even if we achieve AGI and give each player access to the greatest coach imaginable, we would still find a power law distribution proportional to the degree of creativity of the game.

(The power law is growing even in these board games! https://claude.ai/chat/23e5d0a8-e413-41d9-a70c-c53d4094080a)

The power law distribution of productivity is inevitable and proportional to the degree of creativity (i.e. complexity) of the skill. And it is becoming more extreme.

### All work will become highly creative

Will all of our work really be as productive as highly creative skills like content creation, arts, building startups?

I think work in the physical world will be safe for a while because it'll take longer for AI to penetrate into the world of atoms. It needs a body (i.e. a robot), and those things take much longer to build and scale than software. But, in the digital realm (knowledge work), AI will rapidly make our work highly complex, and therefore highly creative.

To see why, let's take the example of software engineering. I think it's a good case because it's the fastest growing college major, and because those who work with technology are usually the first to adopt new technologies into their workflows and lives. Seeing how AI has changed software engineering will give us a glimpse of the future for all knowledge work.

Before AI, the majority of actual software engineering work was only moderately creative. Anyone who's built software applications before large language models knows just how much grunt work there is to turn an idea into reality. The majority of code written was "glue code" (todo: get a good reference here): code used to connect together different software services to make it do what you want. A simple idea for an app would take weeks of grinding through predominantly not that creative grunt work in order to actually bring it to life.

Now, with the latest AI models (OpenAI's o1 / Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 3.5), AI can write the majority of the less creativity code that took most of our time in the pre-AI era. Now, more of an engineer's time is spent on more creative work: on the system architecture, deciding which external services to use and why, and on product decisions like figuring out what to build and why, and they only need to drop down into lower creativity work in the cases that AI fails. And working on higher level architecture and product decisions is far more creative than writing glue code because there are many, many more possibilities in how you can do it. [not_for_deep_tech]

What will happen when each engineer has access to models that are 10x more capable than the current ones? What happens when each engineer has access to a near infinite number of reasonably capable, always-on, fast, teammates they can instruct as if they were instructing junior teammates? What happens when you can give an AI a detailed spec of the software you want built, and some design inspirations to help guide its style and look and feel, and it does a great job at implementing it? An engineer's work becomes even more creative: they'll focus more on product and business decisions: figuring out what to build and why, and only jumping down into technical details only when the AI fails.

In other words as AI becomes more capable, engineers will require the same skillset as startup founders. And we know just how creative that is, and just how extreme the power law distribution of productivity is for that: most aren't good enough. Most fail.

There are early signs that this shift is well underway. As engineering is becoming more creative, [coding bootcamps are going broke](https://x.com/gergelyorosz/status/1732876403626926300), more startups are hiring engineers the way you hire a creative: based on their portfolio, conversations and referrals alone without any kind of standardized exam (which doesn’t work for creative skills). And junior engineers / new grads no longer have job opportunities because the baseline talent required is much higher than ever before; i.e. the less creative work no longer exists.

It's easy to see how a similar evolution will happen for all knowledge work. Designers who spend time tweaking layout properties in their design software will instead spend far more time on defining the brand, product, understanding users and crafting a compelling vision. Marketers instead of spending most of their time operating software, and doing the grunt work to implement marketing campaigns, will instead spend most of their time understanding and optimizing for the incredibly complex and changing human desire.

The power law distribution of productivity will become un-imaginably steep. The right engineers, marketers, designers, or any role that we will invent, will be many, many orders more productive than the average ones. And those who aren't one of the best, will struggle to make enough.

### Paying to learn no longer works

Therefore, as our work becomes more creative, paying for education won’t make sense for most people because they won’t be able to earn back their investment.

Unless we have a better way to finance education, access to opportunity will likely become more concentrated towards those who have wealth and can afford quality education. (todo: this may require an expansion. it may help to clearly frame the problem i'm trying to tackle: inequality of opportunity NOT inequality of outcomes - which is inevitable).

What options exist for young people in the united states?

1. Scholarships to study at reputed institutions.
2. Working at a company / apprenticeship.
3. Study at free, state funded institutions.
4. Income share agreements (ISA)
5. Learn on their own.
6. Grants

#### 1. Scholarships

While scholarships can be great for those who receive them, but they aren't available at nearly the scale required to be accessible. And the institutions that do have scholarships (merit and need based), have their own way of gauging who receives them and who is accepted - often a biased process that overlooks many with potential, but who are different than what is "expected".

#### 2. Directly working / apprenticeships

Many young individuals who realize that paying a lot to go to college isn't worth it and are exploring ways to start working sooner. Apprenticeships seem to be available for many non-knowledge work trades, it'll be very difficult to break into companies without already having some tangible relevant skill that can create value right away. As our work becomes more creative, fewer individuals will eventually become good enough to create value within companies, and therefore companies will be more apprehensive about hiring for junior / apprenticeship roles.

This is already the case today in Tech: many new grads are struggling to land interviews, let alone jobs, and few, if any, of the fastest growing startups have any internship positions / new grad positions available. This wasn't the case in previous generations when you could more reliably train someone to become good enough.

#### 3. Affordable (or free) public institutions

A natural reaction to the power law is to make education free for all. But, this won't democratize access to opportunity because as our work becomes more creative, the average education from the average institution will lead to no results, rather than average results as it did earlier.

This will happen because as AI gets better, and the power law becomes more skewed, the cost of quality education will skyrocket. This is somewhat counterintuitive because it feels that as AI improves it will provide quality education for all cheaply.

But as AI is better at teaching something, the market will value something beyond that - just as how when computers could perform advanced number calculations, there was no more of a need to hire someone skilled at calculating manually. Similarly, if AI can teach how to code a certain kind of software well, then that skill becomes a commodity and the skill that becomes valuable is being able to leverage such an AI to create value.

As the power law distribution for a skill grows, so does the power law distribution for teachers of that skill. The more creative, the fewer good teachers there are, and the worse off the average teacher becomes. Therefore, in a highly creative world with an extreme power law distribution of outcomes, those who are capable of actually increasing an individual's chance of becoming one of the best at their skill will be invaluable and everyone will flock to them.

Making education free through the government paying institutions to keep them running only props up mediocre institutions with mediocre education. Nearly useless in a highly creative world because such institutions will never be able to afford those who are good enough at the skill to teach because their market value is far too high. And propping up such institutions may do students more harm than good because it will encourage many into learning in a way that they'll find out in a few years that the market doesn't care for. These students will painfully realize that they've lost something far more valuable than money: their time.

#### 4. Income share agreements (ISA)

(TODO)

#### 5. Learn on their own

I'm starting to see some high schoolers correctly determine that paying for college isn't worth it (and that college itself is likely a waste of time), and are following their own curiosities to directly create value in the world through content, businesses, startups, etc. They explore and build with friends, cold message mentors for guidance, and are incredibly competent and resourceful. I expect many young, talented, individuals take this path in the coming years. They will build massive companies at incredibly young ages.

But, there's still the problem of how to sustain yourself as you create your own learning journey. For those who have access to some money (perhaps through family), this path works well. For those who have to find ways to make ends meet will need to get some sort of side hustle. While side hustles can be helpful to an extent, they quickly become quite harmful after a because they eat away at the time you can spend honing your craft. How much time you spend on your craft correlates to how good you can get at it. A rich kid with the freedom to create and build all of the time will likely do much better than someone who can only spend a few hours a day and weekends to hone their craft, even if the rich kid isn't as talented.

#### 6. Grants

There are some grants available to enable individuals to explore and create on their own terms without the distraction of needing to sustain themselves. E.g. [Thiel fellowship](https://thielfellowship.org/), [Emergent ventures](https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures).

This is an incredible opportunity for those who receive it, but grants are too scarce and don't scale to be able to serve all those who would make great use of such money.

---

As a result, as our work becomes more creative, and given the paths available to young people, access to opportunity will become concentrated towards those who have the wealth to enable individuals to explore, create, and hone their creative skills.

While wealth is concentrated, talent is widely distributed. Therefore, most of the world's most talented individuals, with the potential to solve our most pressing problems, will be born into families without much wealth, if any. Without a better way to allocate resources to those with the potential, we significantly slow down human progress and unfairly penalize misfortune.

We need a way to finance education that doesn't burden individuals with debt that they most likely won't be able to repay, that democratizes opportunity such that anyone with the potential to do great work will gain access to all the resources they need - regardless of the wealth they come from.

### Venture capital is the best way to finance learning

Venture capital is a form of financing for risky, high-potential projects. Investors give companies money, so that they can build their product, in exchange for some ownership in the company itself.

Investors know many of their investments will fail, but they bet that the few massive successes will more than make up for the losses. For example, an investor might invest in ten startups knowing that seven might fail completely, two might return their money, but one might become the next big thing and generate returns hundreds of times larger than their initial investment.

This model works particularly well for financing things that follow power law distributions - where a small number of winners capture most of the value. Traditional financing, like bank loans, works best when outcomes follow a normal distribution (think of a bell curve) where most borrowers can repay their loans with modest success. But venture capital is designed specifically for situations where outcomes are highly skewed - where most attempts generate little value, but a few generate enormous value. This is why venture capital has been so successful in technology, where a single breakthrough product can capture an entire market.

If investors invest in companies, does this mean everyone has to start their own company in order to be invested in? How exactly would venture capital financing work for education?

An ambitious high schooler today, instead of going to college, can directly start a company and create something the world wants. They can directly generate revenue and / or raise money from investors for their project. There’s a growing number of young people pursuing this path, some with great success. As AI becomes more powerful and our work becomes far more creative, we should see many more young people directly pursue building companies.

But, starting a company typically requires the founding team to have at least a rough idea of the problem they’re tackling, how they’re going to do it, and strong competence - else it’s difficult for an investor to put money in their hands. Developing this foundation of an idea and competence can take some time, which again puts disproportionate stress on those who don’t have the financial means to take the time to develop this foundation.

Some incredibly valuable paths also require more exploration before the individual discovers the important angle to tackle. For example, Charles Darwin required extensive exploration and study of nature before he had his breakthrough that shook the scientific community, and later the world. Darwin was partly financially supported by his family during the early stages of his career, which allowed him the freedom to thoroughly explore his interests and develop his revolutionary ideas over many years. (Meanwhile many other potential Darwins were stuck plowing fields and doing work to survive that prevented them from following their natural curiosities.)

Lastly, not every talented person is going to want to take the risk of starting a company. Many who are great at what they do will want to join (or invest in) great companies rather than start one.

**We need a way for individuals with potential to be able to raise money to fund their learning - regardless of when (or whether) they start a company.**

As a thought experiment, let's assume we have the following system:

1. A financial abstraction ("Human company") that represents all of an Bob's assets: the companies and the physical & digital assets that he owns.
2. Someone (Alice) can buy ownership in "Human company" such that Alice indirectly owns a percentage of Bob's assets.
3. With the permission of Bob, Alice can share her equity in Bob's "Human company" to someone else.

Like a regular company, the value of a "Human company" before an individual has create any value is more art than science because it is based on the individual's potential to earn over the long-run. Even if Bob has zero assets now, if enough people believe in Bob's potential, a 1% equity in Bob's "Human company" could be worth tens of thousands of dollars or more. By, selling stake in his "Human company", Bob trades some of his future wealth for incredibly valuable capital today which would help enable him to generate that future wealth.

Now, let's revisit the situation we analyzed in the previous section: Bob is young, ambitious and has shown early talent for designing products. Bob wants to spend his time tinkering and honing his craft, and possibly also exploring other avenues of expression he's curious about such as creating content. Bob would then raise money on this potential. If a handful of people (or even just one!) believe that over the course of the next couple of decades Bob will do great work that will create tremendous value, they'd buy equity in Bob's "Human company". Bob gets capital to fuel his tinkering and experimentation.

This is how an individual could raise money through venture capital (VC) to fund their education.

In a highly creative world with a heavily skewed power law distribution of outcomes, VC is a much better way to finance education than all of the approaches we considered in the previous section: (_todo: list these out to re-introduce the status quo that we're comparing VC with_).

#### 1. VC scales.

When Bob raises money by selling equity in his "Human company", it may seem that from Bob's perspective it's the same outcome as applying for and getting a grant. Though it may be practically the same thing from Bob's perspective, when investors can invest directly in an individual's "Human company", we would see orders of magnitude more capital available to young people because many investors would be drawn to invest their money in order to multiply their wealth like how starving bees are drawn to nectar.

Greed scales.

Greed is reliable.

Greed is anti-fragile.

#### 2. VC aligns incentives.

When Alice invests in Bob, it's in Alice's best interests to help Bob succeed because Alice only generates wealth if Bob does as well. Alice would connect Bob to mentors and resources that would help Bob

#### 3. VC will be the only way to afford the best teachers.

As the power law distribution of outcomes becomes more skewed, the best teachers will be far too expensive for any institution to be able to hire them. No business school can afford Elon Musk or Paul Graham to teach. No computer science program will be able to afford the best engineers. No design school will be able to afford the best designers. The gap between their market value and what an institution can pay them will be too great.

The best teachers will teach for free in exchange for equity in outcomes because the potential returns from that are actually meaningful.

We would see engineering / design schools run similar to how startup accelerators are run: those accepted are **paid to join** and learn from great mentors and peers, in exchange for small equity in their outcomes, which they would be more than happy to give up (unless they have better alternatives already).

#### 4. VC incentivizes distributing knowledge freely.

When the best teachers can directly invest in their students' outcomes, many will share all of their knowledge to the world for free as marketing to attract students to them because their wealth will predominantly come from the future success of their students, rather than by selling courses, etc.

As the power law becomes more skewed, and with the ability to invest in individuals, only mediocre teachers will be the ones putting their knowledge behind a paywall, because if they could actually impact a student's outcomes, they'd make far more wealth by investing in students directly.

(teachers that monetize through VC - e.g. Paul Graham)

#### 5. VC democratizes access to opportunity over time.

Greed will drive investors to discover and enable talent regardless of the wealth they come from. A budding content creator in rural Alabama, a high schooler in inner city Baltimore with a strong aptitude for engineering, or an affluent child in a Bay Area suburb with talent for design would all be sought after by investors.

Of course it'll take time for opportunity to be truly democratized. Those who don't come from means will continue to be underrepresented for a while because it's more difficult for them to develop sufficient skills to allow their innate talents to manifest due to environmental challenges out of their hands. For example: even if a child has a strong aptitude for design, if they grow up in a violent, neighborhood with parents who neglect them, their talent will have a difficult time expressing itself, and therefore investors wouldn't want to take a risky bet on them.

But, VC creates the economic incentives to create the right environment for an individual's innate talents to shine, because the more talent available, the more wealth can be generated for everyone involved: the individuals, and their investors.

### Concerns

#### What about those who no one wants to invest in for whatever reason?

We will need some sort of [Basic Income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income). With the ability to invest in individuals, basic income can be implemented as a form of investment. Each individual receives some money from the collective in exchange for giving up some equity of their assets to the collective - such that each person holds equity in every other person’s (who is in the same country or network) outcomes. They could even trade their equities in others in a marketplace.

This would enable each of us to feel direct ownership in the success of others. One of the greatest cultural challenges we’ll need to deal with is how the rising inequality of outcomes creates a hateful us vs. them dynamic. If each person had direct equity in those that do end up becoming quite wealthy, it may lead to a more cohesive society in which there’s less hatred for those who create a lot of value because it directly benefits each of us. Taxing the wealthy and funneling it back to people through government spending sounds like the same thing, but it’s far from it. When those taxes are funneled through a government bureaucracy and little of it, if any, arrives in the hands of the average citizen, we don’t feel any sense of ownership over the success of the winners.

#### Fraud.

There will certainly be people who will try to cheat others out of money. Those who will claim to have certain skills when they in fact don't. Or claim to want to explore a certain field, but end up just pocketing the money and running. Similarly, there will be many who say they'll invest money and end up not doing so. We will need a good way to prevent fraud. High trust is invaluable. Without it, such a system will never be adopted widely.

#### Mental health.

As AI becomes more powerful and individuals can raise money on their potential, society will feel more unequal than ever before. Each of us is evolutionarily programmed to feel envy. This was a productive emotion back when we were hunter gatherers with less creative work, and therefore had roughly equal outcomes. Back then, if a fellow tribesperson say, hunted one more animal than you, the feeling of envy was productive because it would push you harder on the next hunt to contribute more.

That same envy backfires today. In a highly creative, leveraged world, there will be some who will be unimaginably successful at very young ages. Some of your peers in high school will leave to work on their trillion dollar companies, feature films, global warming research, videos, cancer research, etc. This is excellent for all of us because it pushes our world forward, but the envy will eat into those who haven't de-conditioned their envy. And that's a very difficult thing to do, and much of that also requires some maturity that comes with age.

Similar to envy, each of us is programmed to derive a sense of self-worth by our contributions to our communities and society at large. Therefore, whether we want to or not, we will each feel greater pressure to discover what we can be great at and to work incredibly hard to be great at it, because you won't be able to contribute without being great at what you do. No amount of basic income will satiate our craving to be useful to society. We will need to overcome this outdated programming as well.

But, I see no choice in this matter. Enabling individuals to invest in each other is a natural progression of our species. It is as natural as the inventions of money, democracy, and companies.

### When, not if

As AI rapidly makes the power law distribution of productivity more extreme, the power law distribution manifests in the global economy: the gap between the most powerful country and the rest of the world will skyrocket, and the median nation will become poorer. I wouldn't be surprised if the most powerful nation in a decade is at least 10x - 100x more wealthy than the 2nd most wealthy nation. In fact, I'd bet on it.

Economic power and cultural power go hand in hand. I'm currently sitting in a remote village in the mountains of northern India as I'm writing this. Outside of my window are people wearing jeans and t-shirts as they plough their fields, with one of them playing what I think is some sort of electronic disco music. Most young people in the world feel the need to learn English in order to access the global economy. The most popular American music can be found playing in clubs in every single part of the world. The fight to remain economically relevant in the world is also a fight to preserve cultural identity.

As a result of the growing power law, the nation that becomes the most economically powerful this decade will dictate global world order in ways that we can't even fathom right now. At the global stage, it is no longer a race for physical resources, or arms, but rather a race to cultivate the greatest minds that can create the best things that the world craves - in any domain.

A nation that successfully enables investing in individuals will discover and enable the best talent better than nations that don’t, and takes destiny into its hands. Nations that fall behind will eventually be forced to join the system that allows investing in individuals as a condition for receiving aid - which they will need as the power law on the global scale becomes more skewed - in the same way that countries that lost WW2 and occupied by the US were forced to adopt the more free market, capitalistic system of the US.

It's not a question of if, but rather when.

Let's get to work.

### Notes

<Footnotes>
[ofc_menial_still_valuable] Of course menial work can still be a valuable learning experience. E.g. some of the greatest entrepreneurs recall how they trained their business understanding, customer obsession, and discipline working in the service industry. But, I can’t imagine it’s the best way for, say, the next “Steve Jobs” to be spending her time beyond maybe a summer during high school if we want to enable her to create products that deeply impact the world. How much can you really learn by being constantly berated by customers and barely making a living for years?
