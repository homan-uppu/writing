Contrary to the popular belief that AI will make great education accessible to all, AI will actually _increase_ the cost of education.

When AI can teach you a skill well, it also means that the AI can also do it. When AI can do something well, the world won't pay people to do it. Humans will be pushed to do the work that AI cannot do - which will become more and more complex and creative as AI can increasingly handle the less complex work for us.

But, the more complex a skill is, the more expensive education for it becomes because there are fewer teachers who are good enough at it, and greater demand for those teachers. This is because quality of teaching also follows the power law distribution: the more skewed results are towards the top, the fewer great teachers there are for that skill, and the better they are compared to the average. For example, many can teach high school math reasonably well, or how to assemble a product on a factory line, but very few can teach how to build great companies, write well enough to make a living from it, make films, etc. because these skills are far more complex.

At the same time there will be much greater demand for the fewer great teachers because as the power law distribution of outcomes becomes more skewed to the top, people will be willing to pay a lot more to be at the top.

Greater demand, fewer teachers, means that a great teacher's time will be worth far more than ever before. Soon, only a few will be able to afford paying for great teachers. E.g. those most qualified at teaching entrepreneurship are the ones that institutions can least afford because their time is far too valuable. The best teachers of software engineering, marketing, content creation, etc. will be able to create tremendous wealth for themselves.

Therefore, as our world becomes more complex and creative, high quality education becomes significantly more expensive, and more scarce.

### Paying to learn no longer works

Paying to learn will not make sense for most people because they won't be able to earn back their investment on a reasonable timeline, if at all.

So, what paths remain?

1. scholarships / grants
2. directly working / apprenticeship
3. Study at free, state funded institutions.
4. Income sharing agreements (ISA)
5. learning on your own

#### 1. Scholarships / grants

While scholarships can be great for those who receive them, but they aren't available at nearly the scale required to be accessible. And the institutions that do have scholarships (merit and need based), have their own way of gauging who receives them and who is accepted - often a biased process that overlooks many with potential, but who are different than what is "expected".

There are some grants available to enable individuals to explore and create on their own terms without the distraction of needing to sustain themselves. E.g. [Thiel fellowship](https://thielfellowship.org/), [Emergent ventures](https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures).

This is an incredible opportunity for those who receive it, but grants are too scarce and don't scale to be able to serve all those who would make great use of such money.

#### 2. Directly working / apprenticeships

Many young individuals who realize that paying a lot to go to college isn't worth it and are exploring ways to start working sooner. Apprenticeships seem to be available for many non-knowledge work trades, it'll be very difficult to break into companies without already having some tangible relevant skill that can create value right away. As our work becomes more creative, fewer individuals will eventually become good enough to create value within companies, and therefore companies will be more apprehensive about hiring for junior / apprenticeship roles.

This is already the case today in Tech: many new grads are struggling to land interviews, let alone jobs, and few, if any, of the fastest growing startups have any internship positions / new grad positions available. This wasn't the case in previous generations when you could more reliably train someone to become good enough.

#### 3. Affordable (or free) public institutions

A natural reaction to the power law distribution of outcomes is to make education free for all. But, this won't democratize access to opportunity because as our work becomes more creative, the average education from the average institution will lead to no results, rather than average results as it did earlier.

This will happen because as AI gets better, and the power law becomes more skewed, the cost of quality education will skyrocket. This is somewhat counterintuitive because it feels that as AI improves it will provide quality education for all cheaply.

But as AI is better at teaching something, the market will value something beyond that - just as how when computers could perform advanced number calculations, there was no more of a need to hire someone skilled at calculating manually. Similarly, if AI can teach how to code a certain kind of software well, then that skill becomes a commodity and the skill that becomes valuable is being able to leverage such an AI to create value.

As the power law distribution for a skill grows, so does the power law distribution for teachers of that skill. The more creative, the fewer good teachers there are, and the worse off the average teacher becomes. Therefore, in a highly creative world with an extreme power law distribution of outcomes, those who are capable of actually increasing an individual's chance of becoming one of the best at their skill will be invaluable and everyone will flock to them.

Making education free through the government paying institutions to keep them running only props up mediocre institutions with mediocre education. Nearly useless in a highly creative world because such institutions will never be able to afford those who are good enough at the skill to teach because their market value is far too high. And propping up such institutions may do students more harm than good because it will encourage many into learning in a way that they'll find out in a few years that the market doesn't care for. These students will painfully realize that they've lost something far more valuable than money: their time.

#### 4. Income share agreements (ISA)

Generally, the way ISA works is an institution decides to take the cost and risk in training you in exchange for a percentage (often 20 - 30%) of your first couple of years (or more) of salary. Let's say you receive some training and then get a job that pays $100k each year, you will pay the institution 60k over 2 years.

Income share agreements won't work because most of the wealth generated by individuals will be in the form of equity, not salaries. In a highly complex world with a very skewed power law distribution of outcomes, very, very few students who graduate from an institution will be good enough to create value in the world, and when they do,

#### 5. Learn on your own

I'm starting to see some high schoolers correctly determine that paying for college isn't worth it (and that college itself is likely a waste of time), and are following their own curiosities to directly create value in the world through content, businesses, startups, etc. They explore and build with friends, cold message mentors for guidance, and are incredibly competent and resourceful. I expect many young, talented, individuals take this path in the coming years. They will build massive companies at incredibly young ages.

But, there's still the problem of how to sustain yourself as you create your own learning journey. For those who have access to some money (perhaps through family), this path works well. For those who have to find ways to make ends meet will need to get some sort of side hustle. While side hustles can be helpful to an extent, they quickly become quite harmful after a because they eat away at the time you can spend honing your craft. How much time you spend on your craft correlates to how good you can get at it. A rich kid with the freedom to create and build all of the time will likely do much better than someone who can only spend a few hours a day and weekends to hone their craft, even if the rich kid isn't as talented.
