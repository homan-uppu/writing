having at least 10L in the bank eases the financial pressures on the mind.

therefore, don't move anywhere. you can't afford it. keep this the homebase until you achieve escape momentum.

even if you do get a place, make it in Hyd - it'll be way cheaper than moving to someplace like BLR. at least half the cost without any loss in quality of life (given i'm mostly in a grind phase).

no more spending before revenue / fundraising. ever again.

this is an incredibly valuable skill. hone it.
