Spend time thinking about the kind of personal brand to lean into. There will be no perfect answers (or even great answers) from day 1. It will be a path of experimentation and exploration. Start now. Don't look at, or count on results. Just put your head down and ship projects that are incredibly meaningful to you. Day in. Day out.

The personal brand is also how you will attract strong teammates.

It takes a certain kind of balance and following your natural inquisitiveness, curiosity in order to see this through well. It will take time. Laying each stone well requires an obsessive attention to detail. And a great deal of patience. Determination.

And the best thing is: there is no competition. Take the time to understand what you are, and what your natural inclinations are. And lean into those.
