*yeah, i'm going to think this through right now. this is the most important thing for me to work on right now because this is how i attract the people i want to work with towards me.*
## roadmap
1. publish essays.
2. start newsletter.
3. learn. share. write. iterate.
4. launch micro projects (e.g. my curated library). each successful micro product should further amplify the brand. someone who comes for the library will also likely read my essays, and subscribe to the newsletter.

there is no need to plan beyond publishing at the moment. there's no need to commit to some larger project just yet. allow any big project to be a natural evolution of your exploration, not something you force onto the world. team is the only moat that matters, and it will take some time to build the right team. be very patient. the power law is everywhere and becoming unimaginably extreme. you must listen to it. the power law rewards patience and the persistence to get things right. the power law rewards quality.
## momentum

it may take a few months or even year(s) to build sufficient momentum. but, it will get easier over time as you will start to feel a pull from the world for your ideas. you just have to keep at it over a long period of time.

we're moving from the age of companies to the age of the individual. having a strong personal brand with the right audience is the most important asset. far more important than having some money in the bank or wealth accumulated through other assets. your personal brand will attract wealth over time.

## my craft

great storytelling is the superpower.
i'm going to hone this craft. i'm going to be absolutely one of the best at it in my domain. i know it because i have a deep, natural, inclination towards it. even though i may suck at it now, i have the capacity to put in the necessary iterations to become great at it. and i shall.

great writing is a massive force multiplier for anything you want to accomplish. the more people use AI as a crutch for writing, the more impactful, and important, great writing becomes.

for this initial phase, i want to explore my natural curiosities and inclinations through writing on my site - and distributed on X / Farcaster. after finding some semblance of pmf with writing, i'll start to dabble in more visual expression: images (e.g. visualizevalue), and eventually video.

the most important thing though is building momentum. start publishing ideas and presenting them exceptionally well. share exceptional quality thinking with the world. each word, each image must carry its weight. nothing extraneous. nothing superfluous. no fluff. everything must pack a punch.
