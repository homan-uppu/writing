my burn would actually be lower in Netala than it is here.
400 * 30 = 12k for food.
10k for rent.
5k misc.

would be about 27 - 30k / month.

whereas in Hyd: 22k per month is what it comes out to.

so, they're quite comparable. just getting to Netala can be expensive: 20k (flight + travel + initial days setup + buying a desk and chair). but once you get there it's quite affordable. you could consider this.

there is a significant general life gain from being in nature, next to Ma Ganga. there is something powerful in the area.
