that session was eye-opening. the environment does make a difference for my practice. a significant difference. i'm now committing to 6 hours of meditation each day during this phase.

the mountains are very conducive. there were moments when the sound stilled, the wind stopped, and it felt like nature was nudging me to turn attention inwards. as if the countless great sages who walked this path over the millennia were standing behind me with their hands on my shoulders supporting my desire and efforts to seek Truth, to master my mind, to rise above my delusions.

continue walking on this path. i can feel it. the mountains are your training grounds to prepare your work and importantly, your self, to change the world.

meditate.

i see this process as the foundation for any creative expression. you cannot find your natural expression until and unless you sufficiently still the mind. you can only do so with a deep practice.

ease into the practice. singularly focus on this current essay.
