- monospace - to give off vibe of "rough", "intermediary (this will be turned into something else - like a film / product)".
- sans-serif - clean. minimal. out of the way. somewhat mechanical.
- serif - classic. human.

just use the simple, straightforward font.
monospace hurts readability for sure. and you don't gain much from it.
