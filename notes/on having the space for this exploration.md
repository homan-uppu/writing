moving towards a high burn rate is a terrible idea at this stage. instead, seek low burn solitude. give yourself the time and space to think things through without any external pressure of a deadline (which a higher burn rate indirectly creates).

you are building a foundation that will last a lifetime. it naturally deserves some time to create. give the process the time and space.

also, focus on excellent communication skills. this will be your strong suit. start with the writing: you need to have worthwhile thoughts before you worry about how to best get those thoughts to the world. focus on the silent, unflashy, act of sculpting your thinking through writing. this is the first step.

Kanatal feels right. there are no coincidences. Akash came out of the blue to recommend it for a reason. it's where i'm meant to write my manifesto. it's where i'm meant to finally put forth my vision for the world... in a bold, honest, way.
