## Thatha's - decided.
Do Thatha's place in Hyd. there's no better place where i don't need to have a predetermined period to commit to. will be home alone for most of the day except for when Lakshmi comes to make food / someone else come to clean the place / do chores.

- Get 1gbps wired connection. 
- Get a good chair for your back. 
- Order a mx master 3 online, and a UPS system for uninterrupted internet.

And that's all you need. Just get to the grind. Spend a lot of time per day in the Puja room meditating.

This is far more productive than even BLR. In BLR you still have to walk around: go to the grocery store, go to the Yoga shala, etc. This place in Hyd is straight up perfect. You only walk when you want to, not because you need to. You can go on solid runs to OU in the mornings / evenings.

And you know this apartment will be around for almost an entire year. that should be more than enough time to break through. and even if it doesn't happen by then, there should be plenty of options to rent in DD colony area afterwards. don't even think that far. if you bust ass, you should be bouncing within months.

and the best part? when you bounce, you just drop your stuff off in Mokila, grab passport, and hop on a flight. no need to worry about security deposits, long-term financial commitments, giving away things, etc. just get up and go. i like that freedom.

and importantly, it keeps burn ridiculously low: < 10k / mo. easy.
make it happen.
really have to thank this man for giving me as new life. go make him proud. amen.
## Netala
- if i can get 100mbps... but even then, Hyd is more productive. but, the only downside of Hyd is that i lack the nature i want. i can't just go on great walks when i get stuck... but you can! just keep lapping the block - like you did w/ Saathwik. that works right?
- fast internet, and having the ability to climb up the mountains daily for my workout would be incredible. one trek up these mountains is incredibly revitalizing. this is an important point to understand: i.e. how important is walking, and where i can get my walking in. from a walking perspective, even Mokila is excellent: that running stretch is a solid walking stretch as well. could also buy a bicycle?

## Banglore - HSR.
- could start off with a 1 month trip. just to do Ashtanga in the am, and cafe work through the day. but, for some reason, i'm not feeling the desire to do something temporary. i'd much rather get a spot where i can bunker down for the entire phase (until escape velocity). NEEDing to work out of a cafe is a bit tough... will then need to invest in some sort of home arrangement as well. and that goes back to why i don't want to do this.
