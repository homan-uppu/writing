damn, he stayed here for 2 month stretches? it's clearly doable. i just wonder how productive he was actually able to be... hmm... that's the only question that i have.

i'm just not in the frame of mind to write this just yet. what do i need to make this happen? the more frustrated you get, the further you get from being able to write this. need a sufficiently stable environment. nothing else works.

how the hell do you set that up? firstly, is this area, this kind of lifestyle, conducive to being able to write this? what has worked well in the past? Looking back at it, Siror actually worked well. Though, it was really tough to initially get in the groove. and even after that, there were frustrating times because of the extreme weather and distractions from the various events that took place.

the best env for me to grind is to rent a small room / office in Hyd. OR: just work out of the DD colony library - that works too!

damn. the best would still be the DD colony rooftop. amen brother. when you're this uncertain of it, might just make more sense to just stick here for another day or so? just soak in the sun, fresh air, and nature. go on long walks. meditate. and write. not much else to do eh?

quite convinced that this isn't the spot. this isn't where you're going to be able to do your work.

options:
- **mountains**:
	- move to the private room here - so that you can escape to do work indoors when it gets busy out here in the common areas
	- find another place that is more conducive to grinding.
	- Netala: go to a place where you already have experience grinding.
- **BLR** - this feels better no? from a productivity perspective? but, you will need to invest in a great work setup bro (at home). but, renting a place etc. is just to much of a hassle. what works is to splurge on a 2 week trip: stay in the nice place... work out of Blue tokai (perhaps even the Koramangala one).
	- this is optimal - IF you find the right place. else, it doesn't make much sense (adjusting to a place is a pain in the ass. seriously.)

---

- Hyd is completely ruled out... **unless** you are working out of the new house - which can be a reasonable experiment. you can start setting up your room. move over the desks, monitor, chair, etc.
	- in which case, it could work... the only problem is that the degree of comfort might be too high. and there is ongoing work inside the home which could be a pain in the ass. and the whole fam interaction isn't something i think will help. hmm...

- BLR - you can focus on getting in your Yogasanas, and grind out of cafe, and eat incredibly healthy at gonative. there's a routine you can get set up here. try it...

the point is that this phase requires a strong routine. without routine, you're not going to be able to see it through to the extent that you have to. the core of the routine is fasting. fasting is what gives the mind the strength to see clearly. amen.

i'm leaning towards a 2 week sesh in BLR to knock out the essay (first draft) and start the many iterations it will need to go through. amen. one long morning session. long meditation break (will need to find a good place for this). eve sesh. dinner. back to room.

Netala **could actually work**. it will take a day or so to settle in, but i think you can build a strong routine there to knock this out of the park.

you should stay on the Netala side: be closer to infrastructure: internet is actually important, no matter what you may think right now. this is key.

you could even just stay there for a week at the least, even that should be quite productive.

the point here is: you can write while being very close to nature: specifically close to the beautiful hike next to the Bhairav Mandir. getting that walk in daily is transformative.

the point is: going into chaos (BLR) doesn't feel right just yet. it isn't the greatest for my health (pollution, etc.). but, that being said, blr does have the yogasana angle. but, you're going to be breathing in crap.

if i were to visualize the routine in Netala:
- 4:30 - 7:30 - start the day with a long meditation session.
- 7:30 - 8:30 - yogasanas on the rooftop. soak in the sun.
- 8:30 - get started strong w/ a hot cup of chai on your side.
- noon - lunch.
- 1pm - 2:30pm daily hike + a meditation on the hill.
- 2:30 - 8pm: grind.
- eve sit (for an hour).
- pass out by 10pm.

this routine for even 2 weeks will achieve a lot. but, i'm not convinced it's better than in BLR - assuming you can get a good place in the interior, peaceful, parts of HSR. that would be absolutely ideal. hit the yogashala very early: by 6 / 6:30 am. knock out the practice and come back home before the traffic & pollution begin. for the rest of the day, grind out of your neighborhood / do a sesh at Blue Tokai.

the reason BLR could be better is the infrastructure, connectivity, and access to talent in case you want to quickly execute on something. but, from a pure health perspective, it is definitely lacking. i mean, Netala also gives me the option to go on long runs on the road towards Maneri - you can easily clock in 5 - 10k per day on a beautiful run.

the one thing i might need to get in Netala is: a solid desk and chair. that's definitely lacking. and i think that might actually hold me back a bit. amen. but, if you get that, wouldn't that work? perhaps. perhaps not. all of these things are difficult to tell. amen.

from a pollution perspective, i'd actually pick Hyd over BLR - sufficiently outside of the city. DD colony is a haven in and of itself. amen.

why not just Hyd bro? i just can't justify paying huge rents outside. it just doesn't make any sense until you have the breakthrough. fuck my indecisiveness about this. look, you HAVE to pay rent somewhere. this is non-negotiable. you just can't grind from home. it's really that simple. amen.

you can move into the new home by apr 12 apparently. so all you need is 2 weeks someplace and then move straight into the new home. amen.

you can take the sayankalam flight out. it's actually heating up here and i think i can get a solid sesh in right now. i think the temperature does play a difference in my productivity as well. hmm...

---

fancy desks, monitors, ridiculously fast internet, etc. don't help. the technique you must develop is entirely within.
what you need to do is strong internal work.
all of this other nonsense simply ain't going to cut it.

the internal work requires a certain lifestyle: wake up early, soak in the sun, and clock in a strong concentration session. amen. all of those pieces are critical. especially waking up with the sun.

---

ok, what's the decision here? i'm leaning towards BLR. but, i could also give this place another day? maybe. just get the private room. grind for a few days, and see how it goes? maybe that's the way to go. i'm not sure. you have an hour to make the call. if you're going, you must leave by 1pm at the latest because that means you'll get there by 4pm giving you just enough time to catch the flight (with a healthy buffer).

---

i can't grind without some stability in the place: the knowledge that i'll be here for the foreseeable future helps me get into the zone. this is why i don't like staying in really temporary hotel like setups because it reinforces the fleeting feel.

but, this is a weakness. the only control you have is over your attention in this present moment. focus on that and external factors such as where you are, etc. won't matter that much.
