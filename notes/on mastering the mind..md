If we observe carefully, our minds are barely in our control. 

Thoughts come to us, but we can't force a specific thought to arise. At most we can pull our minds towards the direction in which we want to think, but the thinking has to come on its own.

We watch the news and our mind reacts with discomfort, fear, anger. Our phone buzzes and before we know it our fingers are moving to type a response. If we try to focus on something, within a few seconds the mind latches onto something else. We react emotionally in ways that we often wish we hadn't.

Where's the control? Where's the choice, the free will? Oftentimes i'm not sure if i'm using my mind, or whether my mind is using me according to a pre-written biological code passed down through generations of evolution with its unique mutations ("quirks").

Yet, it's possible to tame the mind so that we don't have to react much.

Taming the mind is the greatest force multiplier available to a human being - a possibility that I haven't yet seen in any other creature. Taming the mind makes us better at everything we do: from that's building a generational company to being a better parent.

I'm far from anything close to "mastery", but I'm grateful for every step that I've taken. Nothing has benefitted me more than taming my mind. I can't imagine doing anything more worthwhile than developing greater mastery over my mind.
