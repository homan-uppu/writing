my mind goes into these distraction spirals from time to time.

it becomes anxious and frustrated that progress isn't coming faster.

in that frustration, it craves faster paths to revenue (and ignoring the more valuable long-term paths), or better work setups (which is not at all my bottleneck at the moment).

this phase is an opportunity for me to overcome this inner frustration, and train the mind to act with greater clarity and decisiveness. that is powerful.
