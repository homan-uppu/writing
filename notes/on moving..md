don't overthink it right now.
there is a possibility you go straight to SF. this would save a lot of time and effort on a "move" and setting up, etc. that you'd have to do in BLR.

i don't just want fast internet. i want a nice set up for good posture, larger screen, a desk, and an excellent chair for my back. my posture here isn't that great.

No thinking about this until you knock out your essays - at least 4 solid drafts - and getting them as close as you possibly can to completion. You can even hire editors, start outreach, as well as research from right here itself. Totally doable.

Don't evaluate / make any sort of decisions until you reach this stage. Keep the grind on.
