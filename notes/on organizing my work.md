prepare outreach before you even write the piece! flesh out the title & outreach messaging before getting to the actual essay. this is an excellent strategy because that's what you're optimizing for at the end of the day. it must be shareable and people must want to open it when they receive it.

how to present this next essay? for now, treat it as: homan.sh/education-agi. can decide whether to get its own domain, etc. later. now isn't the time for this.

don't organize it! each piece should be an independent "hit". so exceptional that everyone will want it. you don't get to that "hit" through quantity. you won't get there by having a "catalog" of content that people can consume if they want to. you get there through a hit. the hit doesn't even have to be on your website. it could literally be on its own domain / on a platform / wherever... as long as it leads back to your X profile, you're fine - because then they can reach out to you if they want.

so yeah, get out of the mindset that your work needs some kind of "organization". it really doesn't. make the next thing just fucking incredible. let the organization work itself out later. don't fall into the stupid "padding resume" mindset with small wins. small wins don't move the needle whatsoever. at all! go big or go home.

so, i'm about to write an essay about education in a post-AGI world. an in-depth analysis about how AI is changing the world, and what that means for how billions will learn. from first principles.

i'm going to do this. no more "analysis" or rumination. this next step is clear.

- you already have a great foundation in the essay you wrote in the Himalayas: the vc-education piece. the only problem with is is that it needs to be significantly better crafted, expanded, and presented in an absolutely incredible way.
