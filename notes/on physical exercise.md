i'm leaning towards starting up a serious Ashtanga practice again.
there is something to it that works, and is very well aligned with meditation.

i remember '21 - pre surgery days, and those were some of the healthiest days imo. there was something powerful about those daily sessions of me with myself on the mat, with guidance from a great teacher when required.

making a move to HSR layout would help establish this foundation.
