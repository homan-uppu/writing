after yesterday's conversation with Harithas, i've decided he's just not a good person to chat with. not that he's not a good person in general, but i'm convinced that on the spectrum of internal freedom and ability to see possibilities, he's on the very closed off edge. he's not qualified to be a part of the "sangha".

i think the Buddha was spot on: on any path of mastery, associate with people at the same level (in that domain of mastery) or ahead of you. do not associate with those behind. this does require an honest evaluation of where you are in relation with others. a healthy of comparison that enables you to build the right tribe.

the quality of your tribe has a strong impact on your outcomes.

and this is the greatest challenge with any difficult path. there will be very, very few people who are worth spending time with - who will push you to see possibilities you couldn't imagine, and who will inspire you to make the most of the opportunities in front of you.

must be v. v. selective from here on out. have an exceptionally high bar. and don't compromise the bar. walk alone if there is no one you know that meets that bar. and continually make efforts to meet those who are at that bar. this is the path.

you will require an exceptionally strong internal game in order to survive this difficult path.

### Ekla chalo re! (Tagore).

If they answer not to your call walk alone.

If they are afraid and cower mutely facing the wall,

O thou unlucky one, open your mind and speak out alone.

If they turn away, and desert you when crossing the wilderness,

O thou unlucky one, trample the thorns under thy tread, and along the blood lined track travel alone.

If they shut doors and do not hold up the light when the night is troubled with the storm,

O thou unlucky one, with the thunder flame of pain ignite your own heart, and let it burn alone.
