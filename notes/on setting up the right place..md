getting the right setup will take time. i suspect at least 1 week (max) to both finalize the place, get the necessary equipment, ingredients, etc. give this process the time it needs so that you get the right place. it's important to have the right place.

ideally, i'd like to get set up by Sunday evening, to start my course Monday morning - Sat morning.

this is it. there's no more planning. go make it happen. done.
