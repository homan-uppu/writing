I'm going to craft two excellent drafts:
1. Why VC will eat education
2. Seeking truth is the only skill (my philosophy on life).
	1. This is very important for me to think through because this is the foundation of my life. even more important than the specifics of some project. this is life itself.

When the first essay is complete, I'm going to socialize it by reaching out to people who I know are great thinkers, who also have the time and space to give me feedback on my thinking, and sharing my Google doc. In the doc, I'm going to take a lot of effort on the assets: images and diagrams. Keeping it in a Google doc is actually better than creating a fleshed out site for it because it gives it the "draft" vibe, rather than something that is already polished. 

When the time is right, I will publish it in a highly polished way, but first let the idea itself gain traction. make it fucking solid.

during this socialization, i'll continue to write 
- "seeking truth"
- "age of the individual"
as well as start the research into how to implement the "investing in individuals" idea such that people can actually start investing in individuals.

this is the plan. and the plan makes sense.
just keep writing. keep thinking deeply. keep fleshing out your thinking.
