this is the path. no matter what kind of exercises i do, i gravitate back to yogasanas because they're the best for my purpose in life, and to build the kind of health that i want to have.

what's a good way to kickstart my practice? you kind of have no choice but to start it here... to build your own discipline.

in the ideal world, you'd move to HSR layout and practice at the shala. you could honestly do that now as well, no? going to the Shala changes the equation from practicing every day -> just getting your foot inside the Shala (after which you will automatically do the practice the way you should).

you have to earn the right to move to BLR.
