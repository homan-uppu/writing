I think Brotzky and T Costa are doing incredible work with Fey.com.

the attention to detail is remarkable.

if someone asked me how to hone their craft of product, i'd tell them to study fey (helps that the builders post regularly on X).

but, craft extends beyond just product. you can feel it in every word, sound, image (still or moving).

there's a more fundamental craft that is felt in everything that an individual does. their mark can be felt in every expression, in any medium.

it takes time to nurture this craft.
the most powerful tool at your disposal is the practice. go inwards to find the depth to leap outwards from.

more than time, it's balance.
only a sufficiently balanced mind can find the gems of ideas that are all around it.
and a balanced mind doesn't need much time to spot the great directions within.

aim for the balance.
sustain the hunger, the desire.
you need both to rise.
