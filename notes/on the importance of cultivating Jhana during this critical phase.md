what a massive difference this creates.
the scattered, anxious, wandering, unproductive mind is replace with a collected, focused, concentrated mind that hunts down what it needs to be done like an unwavering hungry lion chasing after its prey.

two very different minds. i know which one i want.

invest a lot of time into the practice. design your life around the practice.
