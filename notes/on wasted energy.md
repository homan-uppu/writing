professional long distance runners obsess over how efficiently they can run. at the elite level, it's not enough to just spend a lot of time training, you need an incredibly efficient form to go along with the right training and diet. any wasted body movement that uses energy without offering any benefits, or worse slowing you down, is often the difference between winning and losing.

similarly, all of us have a notion of efficiency with regards to how we use our minds. the more i study my mind, the more i realize just how inefficient it is. most of my thoughts are useless: worries about the future that i can't control. thinking about how i should have done something different in the past, overthinking about how others will perceive my actions. useless. i have a large room for improvement and i suspect most people do as well.

worrying too much about competition, envying others, letting thoughts wander all over the place, ruminating about the past, over-worrying about the futures that most likely won't play out the way we imagine them to, hold us back from achieving our potentials.

to be clear, i'm not talking about coming up with bad ideas. often, to have a good idea, we have no choice but to wade through dozens if not hundreds of bad ones. i'm talking about the kind of thinking that drains our energy, that not only doesn't lead to good ideas, but hurts our ability to have them.
 
more efficient thinking is beneficial no matter what the goal is. if you want to be a great parent, having a strong thinking economy lets you spend valuable time with your children without your mind wandering constantly towards unnecessary (in that moment) topics. those that don't constantly ruminate on the past, or worry about the future, are more present in their relationships.

the world is evolving in such a way that having a strong thinking economy is becoming more difficult. 

for example, being envious of others was probably beneficial when we all lived in villages of less than 100 people. envy pushed us to work a bit harder, which was eventually beneficial for the survival of our tribe, and hence ourselves. envy when you can compare yourself to 8 billion people on the planet through social media is largely useless.

getting news about how everyone in your tribe is doing, and about issues in the neighboring tribes was probably useful since it actually had an impact on our daily lives. having all of the worlds' problems shoved down your throat each morning, on the other hand, doesn't seem healthy.

the more the world tries to infiltrate our attention, the more difficult it is for us to cultivate a strong thinking economy.

i don't think we have direct control over the mind in that we can't just say "i'm not going to be distracted" and magically have an efficient mind. we only have indirect measures to tame the mind.

better thinking economy is achieved by having awareness of what your mind is doing, having the muscle to let go of thinking cycles that you don't want to feed, and designing life such that you protect you ability to be aware of what's actually happening in the mind.
