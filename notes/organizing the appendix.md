options: link to each separately? yes. use Gdocs, and just link the titles in the Appendix section of the "Notes" chapter.

what to include in the appendix?
- How personal tokens will democratize opportunity. (put this in Google doc).
- VC will be the best way to finance learning. (homan.sh link).

later:
