- problem: 
	- gap accelerating - most education is useless at best, detrimental at worst
	- most students will be crippled by debt that they will not be able to repay anytime soon, if ever.

- AI makes the economy extreme: the power law distribution.
- More complex work - more extreme outcomes.
- AI makes all work more complex
- **exponential acceleration - proportional to how capable AI is.**
- (with good example to demonstrate this).

- The economy wants differentiation and excellence: must be able to contribute something unique that is better than others doing something similar.
- this was not the case before => still had room for undifferentiated average.

- AI makes the cost of education skyrocket - proportional to its capabilities.

- Paying for education no longer works:
- even if the rates were the same - bec. most will not recoup investment. but especially so since the actual cost of quality education has skyrocketed => whatever you pay for will certainly be near-useless.
	- ofc takes time for market to correct for this - so there is some arbitrage opportunity perhaps, but i would be cautious.

- Making education free doesn't work because you will not get the best teachers - you can't afford them. This means this will mostly be an utter waste of tax payer money with no results. - **the missing piece was the thinking around how the cost of education has RISEN! finally. the piece is coming together.**
