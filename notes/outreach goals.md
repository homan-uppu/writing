1. DOES THIS INSTRUMENT WORK FOR VCs to invest in?

this is the most important question of them all. if the supply is there, i will get the demand, that's not an issue imo. let's answer this question. single pointed focus.

---

best case scenario narrative:

- a few early stage VCs express interest in investing in personal tokens.
- a few builders express interest in the idea and help lay an execution roadmap, including introducing me to the right lawyers to legally ground the contract.
- i raise money on my personal token to fuel this. (validate the product angle even before the legal grounding).
- waitlist for VCs grows. waitlist for individuals looking to raise capital grows.

- launch to early users - facilitate their transactions on the Network.

ok i get it, this is super high level. and many details will certainly change as the rubber meets the road. but, this is roughly the kind of progress i'm looking to make (high level).
