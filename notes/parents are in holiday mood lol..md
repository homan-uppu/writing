is this the best environment for my grind? it can be! this space that you have is quite disconnected. and you can go onto the rooftop straight from your room. you don't have to interact with fam throughout the day. if you do, that's on you, not on them.

if you ever feel a bit restricted, then you can bounce. no problem. but, this feels premature to bounce.
