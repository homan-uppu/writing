if you don't approach this with a sufficiently trained mind that's grounded in sufficient wisdom, you're going to be in for a world of hurt, and more importantly, you're ngmi.

i can already feel it - the validation and conversations to ground this idea into something that actually works is going to take some time. many iterations of the positioning, the details of the contract, the product, etc. are required. there is no way around this.

expect the worst: many months from now still having conversations to line up the set of early investors willing to participate in investing in personal tokens. mentally prepare for this onslaught on your beliefs.

the magnitude of the opportunity is massive. if my predictions about the future are correct (which i believe they are), then this work will shape how millions, billions of people learn. this project is the catalyst for a deep transformation of education.

i don't think there's any notion of what this means.
that's not what this is...

the scope of this idea is large. you must stick with it.
