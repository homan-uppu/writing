many people just seem to believe that they can't possibly chart their own path. build their own brand. start their own business and be their own boss. there's a core internal "block" of sorts that doesn't seem to budge that position.

and of course they're never content with their job. they can't be because they have a disdain towards needing to work to be able to make a living. and they feel like that's the only option, so naturally they're going to join companies that don't have fulfilling work - because they don't even think that's it's possible to do fulfilling work and get paid for it.

their frustration grows. and they take it out on some abstract "system". they claim to want to overthrow the system without having any semblance of a plan that could work. "capitalism" is the enemy. those building businesses "exploit" their workers because clearly no one would would choose to work there if they didn't "have to". it feels like they're just projecting their dissatisfaction towards their work towards the entire world.

it's probably true that most people hate their work, and that's why this notion that all workers are being "exploited" by some abstract system of capitalism is becoming quite popular. i'm not sure how to feel about this. at the moment i feel sad that so many people have such rigid thinking about what they can do with their lives. that it IS possible to do work that is meaningful, fulfilling and pays you well.

ok, let me analyze this from a selfish perspective for a sec. how does this realization change how i live life?

**cut out anyone, absolutely anyone that doesn't meet the following:**
1. working on something that is deeply meaningful and fulfilling to them, or believes that such a reality is possible and are working hard towards it (and spending any free time on the work they find most meaningful and fulfilling). i.e. **either they have found it, or are obsessively seeking it**.
2. **believes that the future can be better than the present** and are interested in working hard to build what they believe is a better future.
3. invests heavily in their **personal growth**. 
4. they are able to take risks: dropping things that may seem to be working reasonably well, in order to seek that which works extremely well. they aren't bound to some rigid definition of how their life needs to progress.
5. who is naturally curious and explorative. always digging deeper into their area of interest.
6. don't blanket hate a class of people. even if that class is "billionaires". ideally don't be sitting in a lot of hate.

and even those that meet these criteria, make the bar exceptionally high. the way they live their life needs to not only feed them energy, but spread to those around them.
