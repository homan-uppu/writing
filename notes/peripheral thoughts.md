1. location for this phase. need to make a decision. i can't work in these conditions. but why not? why not just double the fuck down. you have another 10 days before Amma comes back, why not just adjust? because doing so would create a lot of tension between me and others. I literally just want people to leave me the fuck alone. i mean it.
2. **over-socialization is a huge problem**. this includes content consumption. there is absolutely no need for you to consume content right now. it's a killer. work in silence. no music, no internet, nothing. just write the fucking manifesto. we can clean it up with AI later, but don't touch the internet as you write this. seriously.
