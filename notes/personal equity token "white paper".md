## audience
(ranked)
0. **myself**: i need to clarify what i'm building, why, and how to go about it. a sufficient rigor in thinking is required before i can go to others and ask for feedback - else it doesn't feel like i'm respecting their time.
1. **collaborators**: people who resonate with the idea and want to help bring it to life.
2. **investors**: people who want to invest in individuals through personal tokens, and invest in the idea as well (i.e. the team that works on this idea).
3. **users**: people who want to raise money through personal tokens. this is actually the least important audience to cater to right now. the platform when it launches will be focused on this audience.
## what to cover
1. how it works (for users who want to raise money and investors who want to invest in personal tokens).
2. features.
3. purpose.
4. long-term vision. (stupidly ambitious, long-term vision of how the world is going to work).
5. how to implement this.
	1. incentives
	2. legal
	3. technological
6. open questions (things to figure out).
7. how this is a natural extension of our species: a look at the arc of history, and why this is the next chapter.
8. call to action:
	1. things i need help with. how we can collaborate. how to give feedback, etc.
