need to write a "personal mission statement" that guides my actions. there is an underlying feeling that i'm "reacting to". the manifestation of this feeling is currently the personal tokens approach. but, even if that angle isn't viable for whatever reason (though that shouldn't be the case), this underlying feeling can predict what else i would work on. i need to write this to bring clarity to what this feeling is, so that i can make myself more predictable to myself and those i work with.
