to enable Nature's natural (/ artistic) expression.
each living being is Nature's expression of itself.
by enabling each living being to express itself naturally - according to its innate inclinations, we enable Nature itself to express itself more naturally - through its creations.

what greater expression exists than to enable Nature itself to express itself. - the ultimate meta expression.

- the financial instrument to democratize opportunity is one small step on this journey.
- art is required to shape culture to push each individual to find their natural expression, and to double down on it.

the purpose of my life is to make progress on both of these axes - to help create a world that i wish i had - one in which everyone's innate talent has the space to be discovered, nurtured and fully realized.
