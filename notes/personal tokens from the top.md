what am i trying to do here? what is the critical path?

- get to the spec. you need to channel the vision to be able to see it. you need to see it. that requires sufficient mental balance, so first, focus on that. yeah, what's missing in this moment is the vision for the future, not the technical details. the technical details will flesh themselves out - it's just a matter of time.

**vision -> spec of what the system is -> how to implement it.**

this is the order of thinking this through.
