People need to be able to invest in each other through “personal tokens”: a token that represents the assets owned by an individual.

  

For example:

  

Alice should be able to buy equity in the assets that Bob will accumulate in the future: such as the equity in the companies he will create / join, the crypto currencies he will hold, the companies he will earn / buy equity in, etc.

  

Say, Alice buys 1% equity in Bob’s personal token ($BOB) for $100k.

  

As Bob creates value in the world and accumulates assets (or increases his potential to accumulate assets), the value of Alice’s ownership in $BOB increases according to its perceived value - in the same way that the value of equity in a company is determined by its long-term potential to create value.

  

With Bob’s approval, Alice can sell her $BOB equity to someone else. 

  

Or Alice can hold onto it and be compensated her share whenever Bob liquedates any of his assets. E.g. when Bob sells his stake in ACME.co for $10m, Alice receives 1% of that: $100k.

### Why we need personal tokens that others can invest in

As AI becomes more powerful, outcomes in all fields will increasingly follow a power law distribution: a few create most of the value. Today this is already true in most highly creative fields (startups, entertainment, etc.), but AI will make this true for any kind of work (software engineering, design, marketing, ops, manufacturing, etc.)

  

As outcomes become skewed towards the top, the median outcome will fall and will soon not be enough for most. There will be no “middle class”. Therefore, paying to learn will no longer work because most won’t earn enough on a reasonable timeline, if ever, to pay back their investments in their education.

  

Venture capital (VC) - putting money in the hands of someone in exchange for a small ownership in the outcomes they generate (e.g. the companies they will create, or the assets they will own in the future) - will be the best way to finance learning at scale. VC is the best way to finance things that have a power law distribution of outcomes (startups, entertainment, etc.).

  

An ambitious high schooler today, instead of going to college, can directly start a company and create something the world wants. They can directly generate revenue and / or raise money from investors for their project. There’s a growing number of young people pursuing this path, some with great success. As AI becomes more powerful and our work becomes far more creative, we should see many more young people directly pursue building companies.

But, starting a company typically requires the founding team to have at least a rough idea of the problem they’re tackling, how they’re going to do it, and strong competence - else it’s difficult for an investor to put money in their hands. Developing this foundation of an idea and competence can take some time, which again puts disproportionate stress on those who don’t have the financial means to take the time to develop this foundation.

Some incredibly valuable paths also require more exploration before the individual discovers the important angle to tackle. For example, Charles Darwin required extensive exploration and study of nature before he had his breakthrough that shook the scientific community, and later the world. Darwin was partly financially supported by his family during the early stages of his career, which allowed him the freedom to thoroughly explore his interests and develop his revolutionary ideas over many years. (Meanwhile many other potential Darwins were stuck plowing fields and doing work to survive that prevented them from following their natural curiosities.)

Lastly, not every talented person is going to want to take the risk of starting a company. Many who are great at what they do will want to join (or invest in) great companies rather than start one.

We need a way for individuals with potential to be able to raise money to fund their learning - regardless of when (or whether) they start a company.

And hence we need a new financial instrument: the “personal token” as described above. It is a legal, technological and cultural product (or better: core piece of infrastructure of future economy). I think the legal piece can be created (need to talk to lawyers to make sure). The technology side is clear. The most challenging aspect is how to launch this successfully such that ambitious individuals actually use this to raise money for their careers).

### Implementation notes / brainstorming

Would be ideal to have a way that doesn’t rely on courts to prevent fraud. I.e. create some sort of network that if you are found to be fraudulent you get kicked out of, and as a result lose out on incredible investment opportunities. Leverage greed to keep people acting well. This is already what happens in the startup ecosystem: VCs are held in line because if they burn the bridge with one founder, they’ll struggle to attract future founders - and that’s way more costly than the legal battle against the current company - especially if they win the legal battle.

  

But, this requires every player to be long-term ambitious. If they’re not long-term thinking, or ambitious, they’ll be more tempted to fuck someone else over for short-term gains, and be OK with it even if they’re kicked out of the network (i.e. their last “heist”).

  

So yeah, having the backing of the court system seems necessary, while also minimizing its use through clever incentive design and careful vetting of those who can join this “network”.

Friend.tech was an interesting experiment:

  

Claude:  
Friend.tech was a social trading experiment built on Base (Coinbase's Ethereum L2 network) that allowed users to tokenize their social capital through "Share" tokens. The platform's core mechanics revolved around letting users connect their Twitter/X accounts to create profiles, where each person got their own personal token market. Others could buy and sell "Shares" of them, with prices increasing on a bonding curve formula with each purchase. Share holders received access to exclusive chats with the person whose shares they owned. The platform implemented a 10% fee on each trade, which was split between friend.tech and the person whose shares were being traded.

The platform experienced a significant surge in popularity during late summer 2023 for several interconnected reasons. Its novel mechanics effectively gamified social relationships, while early users demonstrated impressive profits through strategic trading. The participation of prominent crypto influencers generated substantial FOMO in the community. Additionally, the exclusive chat feature provided actual utility to the shares beyond mere speculation. The timing was also fortunate, as friend.tech launched during a relatively quiet period in the crypto space, allowing it to become the dominant narrative.

However, the platform's relevance began to wane as several factors came into play. The initial novelty factor gradually wore off, and engagement in private chats began to decline. Many early users who had made substantial gains chose to take profits and exit. Questions arose about the long-term sustainability of the model, and new competing social token experiments emerged in the space. While the experiment demonstrated the potential for tokenized social capital, its impact ultimately proved more temporary than transformative in the broader crypto ecosystem.

But I don’t think it worked because it wasn’t grounded in real ownership of assets, and because the default mode was too “free”: anyone could buy and sell whenever they wanted without the permission of the person who’s token they were trading. This is like forcing new companies to be public from day one. It doesn’t allow for the right foundation to build a great company (and in the case of a personal token, a great career).

  

- Design in way that is “open” / “decentralized” such that there isn’t a good reason for someone to want to copy this and spin up their own version. Anyone thinking along these lines, should feel the desire to collaborate instead of compete. For this to happen, it must be presented as a foundational, open, infrastructure for society.

- (specifically: “Personal tokens - the genre of projects such as [Bitclout (now deso)](https://bitclout.com/u/deso), [friend.tech](https://www.friend.tech/) and many others that create a token for each person and make it easy to speculate on these tokens - are a category that I would call "proto info-finance". They are deliberately creating market prices for specific variables - namely, expectations of future prominence of a person - but the exact information being uncovered by the prices is too unspecific and subject to [reflexivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexivity_(social_theory)) and bubble dynamics. There is a possibility to create improved versions of such protocols, and use them to solve important problems like talent discovery, by being more careful about the economic design of a token, particularly where its ultimate value comes from. Robin Hanson's [idea of prestige futures](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/more-academic-prestige-futureshtml) is one possible end state here.”)
