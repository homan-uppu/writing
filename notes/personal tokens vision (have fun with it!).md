(after critical mass is achieved)
- every person in the world has a personal token.
- every ambitious individual will want to raise money early on to finance their learning journeys by giving up some equity in their personal token.
	- why won't UBI be enough to finance exploration? - bec. there is a limit to how much UBI we will get. Beyond a certain point UBI will not optimize for collective economic growth, and therefore there will be a "ubi_threshold".
- UBI is provided in exchange for some equity in the personal token. What this represents is that more you rely on society to stand and thrive, the more you ought to give back to society when you create your wealth - proportional to how much you relied on society (through UBI).
- UBI will be a choice. Many of the most ambitious will not rely on it because they will have investors.
- There is no "Utopia". As inequality of outcomes rises, those who don't retrain their minds will be unhappier than any generation that came before them, while simultaneously having far more than their ancestors. (i.e. Abundance is suffering for untrained minds).
- Power law distribution of outcomes will be extreme: the majority of the value created will be from a very, very small minority. But, the winners will be equally distributed across the world - across community, socioeconomic status, races, religions, etc. very unequal outcomes, but more equal opportunity.

this is the future that i see.
