**health**:
- strict OMAD.
- exceptionally strong practice.
- daily exercise in nature (whatever comes naturally).
- the right sleep schedule.
- (keep up strong discipline).

**work**:
1. knock out a **completed draft** of the essay along with high quality visuals. i want you to paint the future of personal tokens exceptionally well. the right reader should be able to see what you see.
	1. send this out to folks for feedback - start running the feedback iterations which would likely take a few weeks in and of itself.
2. the **right presentation**: at the degree of difficulty that you believe is the right starting point.
3. a script for the video (if you believe this is still the right move - i'm not sure what other paths may open up through this essay, so be flexible).

---

from here, go straight to video production (if it's the right move) in BLR, else fly to SF. that's it. nothing else in between. you may stop by in Hyd to pick up your passport and bounce... but don't spend an extra second in Hyd if you can avoid it.
