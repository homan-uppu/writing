- remainder of Nov is setting yourself up for this phase.
	- get a place, set up a stellar workspace.
	- restart Ashtanga practice. a couple days of practice should condition the body well for the deeper practice.
- december:
	- publish essay, a spec of the PersonalToken, socialize this idea.
	- daily Ashtanga practice without fail (except for moon days). no other days off unless you're injured. do your best to minimize chance of injury.
	- strict one meal a day. - need to continue the path to health. the past month and a half has been exceptional for the body and mind. need to continue this work.

find a path to SF by the end of the year. once you craft the spec for the personal token, you should have an angle to pitch this and raise money. find that angle. it definitely exists. you just have to find it.
