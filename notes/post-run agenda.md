1. write about your brand. what you stand for, and then get a feel for the content that you're going to create. make sure it's your natural expression. everything else is useless.
2. personal token outreach
	1. craft message for the angels, VCs, and some crypto builders (e.g. folks operating on the product side of thigns: such as at Paradigm, Balaji, etc.)
	2. build list (try to get to 50 people).
	3. reach out tonight. commit to a daily quota once tonight's round it complete.
3. start work on the content. - write script, craft the visual foundation for it. i predict spending quite a bit of time in Figma (and maybe Midjourney?) to flesh this out. amen.
