Now that i've adopted the Google docs strategy, you don't have to move until you have serious momentum. there is no longer the need for really fast internet. it can all be done here.

it's entirely possible to gain this momentum here.
in fact, i should.
i should NOT leave this place.
i should wait for the world to PULL me out of this place.
i should be FORCED out of this place.
there is no reason to leave before feeling such a pull from the world.
i don't need anything more than what i have now. (powerful realization. keep reminding yourself of this).

that being said, if you absolutely do need faster internet for research / building / general productivity, give yourself the option to leave. there are no hard and fast rules here. there are no rules when seeking truth. stick to the process.
