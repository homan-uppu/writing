i'm starting to feel that these are two separate things entirely.

creativity:
- unpredictable.
- can't plan
- don't know when / whether you'll ever be good enough to create value.

power law:

they are different, but BOTH are required.
Creativity shows unpredictability, and difficulty.
power law shows the inequality of outcomes. that it's difficult for everyone to create value - **regardless of training!** (this is the key point).
