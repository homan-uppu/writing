yeah, internet really isn't a problem here.
data is more than fast enough for any kind of research that i'm looking to do.
i can craft the right images / diagrams with this internet speed.
and since i'll be sharing Gdocs anyways, there's **no need to build out any kind of website / presentation layer.**

think very deeply. it's OK if this phase takes a lot of time.

**the next step is to have a very structured research process:**
- active log of what i'm learning.
- some way to organize efforts.
- likely open source infrastructure: enable anyone to spin up their own and also see what we have under the hood.
- find collaborators. organize work. execute hard.
- raise money.

yeah, this is a powerful, powerful angle. As Peter says: double down on this one thing, one thing alone. A singular, obsessive focus.

the angle is quite clear. just dogged execution is required.
lots of work to do.
gotta make it happen.
