**every ounce of effort will be towards creating the world of personal tokens. every fucking ounce.**

high level:
1. get this idea to the smartest, most capable people in the world.
2. raise $1m on your personal token (for 1%) without the network set up - a bare boned MVP built on trust, nothing else. there's no need for a UI for this either, manage everything in a spreadsheet, crypto wallet, 
3. build team, implement, ship.

breakdown:
1. update the white paper with the latest feedback. *this is still v. important because it clarifies your thinking about what this exactly is. and because i'm still going to be socializing it in the meantime.*
2. translating some big picture feelings into words:
	1. write a doc about the kind of content i'm going to create and why (why i think it helps create world of personal tokens).
	2. bring clarity to the character that i'm going to play... who homan is, feelings, beliefs, how he suffers, etc. find yourself.
3. **intro video script** (write without constraints). a comprehensive script along with visual and audio details. an actual, full-fledged script.
4. iterate on video script with feedback.
5. produce and ship the video. go wherever you need to go to make this happen. do whatever it takes to ship a video that you're extremely proud of.
6. carefully construct online presence (top notch banner, profile pic, caption, every single pixel of it).
7. socialize the idea (tweet, video, white paper).
8. think through the mechanism to sell equity in your personal token.
9. ship the MVP (to facilitate your token sale based on trust).
10. raise however much you think you can for 3% equity in your personal token. (you should have a sense for this based on all of the above).

and that's it - this is as far forward as you can see (and even all of what you see may change completely overnight).

notes:
- i have something that the world wants, but doesn't know it wants. **the best stories win**, not ideas, or products. i'm going to tell the best fucking story the world has ever witnessed. that is the bar for my execution. Talking about Vyas level execution, with SSR + Sukku + Kurosawa level visualization.
