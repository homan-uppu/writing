While many may not be comfortable today, I predict that as personal tokens become popular, people will not mind their personal token valuations and transaction histories to be public information - similar to how younger generations are far more open to putting their lives on the internet when compared to older people.

But, in the early days, users should have control over how much information about their personal tokens, fundraising history, valuations, transactions are public (or at least, how much of it can be associated with their real world identity). Insufficient privacy can even be a security problem. That being said, potential investors should have access to previous fundraising round information before they make their decision to invest or not.

We'll need to design a system that takes these nuances into account.
