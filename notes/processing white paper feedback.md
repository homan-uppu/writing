### Key questions asked
- There were discussions of this idea in the past, why didn't it work?
- Who would be early adopters?
- What does a personal token derive its fundamental value from, apart from being a speculative store of value?
- Why would selling equity in future outcomes be preferred to taking on debt?
- This feels like a pretty efficient market already, fulfilled by the talent/recruiting industry. Is there an opportunity here that isn't accounted for by current economics?
- What if the personal token holder never starts a company?

points (not really questions):
- similarly I think personal tokens are preferable in some cases but are not clearly better than debt

i'd also like to move the Q&A section to the "How it works" chapter (or add as its own chapter), and get it in before the "Implementation" chapter.
