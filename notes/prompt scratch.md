ok, let's say we have a Network personal token with 10m shares.

whenever a fundraising round is successfully completed, the network personal token (NPT) also gains a small equity (say 0.1%) in the personal token - as a sort of "transaction fee".

therefore, as the network grows and more investments occur, and more equity sales happen, the $ in the network personal token wallet increases, and the value of a share in the network personal token also increases.

the money in the network personal token wallet is considered the "treasury" of the network. it will be used to support the core maintainers, legal fees, etc. in order to preserve the integrity of the Network. (be more specific about how this can be used, and why having a treasury is important).

users can also directly trade shares of the network personal token. speculation on the network personal token is a way to speculate on the value of the entire network.

but, if the Network personal token never sells its shares in others' personal tokens, how will its shareholders receive capital gains from it?
1. owners of personal tokens can "buy back" the equity that the NPT has in their PT. this triggers a "sale", that then distributes capital to all shareholders of NPT. (not sure how often this will happen tho).
2. perhaps a certain percentage of capital that goes into the NPT's wallet is immediately disbursed to its shareholders?

there is also a cost to process each fundraise right? - this depends on fleshing out the legal side of things - tbd.
