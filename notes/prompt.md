I want an accordion component that works as follows: 
1. takes in children: one that is just text - that represents the main line of the dropdown component, and a sub component <InnerContent /> that represents the text that is shown when the accordion is expanded.
2. use a chevron down in unexpanded state, and a chevron up in expanded state.
3. use framer-motion to animate the growth / shrinking.
