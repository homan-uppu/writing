i want a way for users of the Network to benefit when the Network grows.
e.g. each user has tiny equity in all other users in the network (through a Network token that is a personal token, but for the entire network?)

i also want a way for the world to trade on a token that represents the Network - on any exchange. this will be useful to raise money for the project.

help me think through ways to achieve these goals (users benefit from Network growth, and are thus incentivized to preserve integrity of Network, and way to fundraise from outsiders).
