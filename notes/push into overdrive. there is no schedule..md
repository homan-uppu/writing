there is no schedule.
become one with this exploration. lose yourself. just create.
there is no set time at which you're going to do Yoga, sleep, eat, run, meditate, work.
optimize fully for the creation, and let everything else fill in the gaps that will naturally occur.
this is the way to live.
be free.
