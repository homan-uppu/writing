all that matters from here on out is the output.
nothing else matters.
curb the agitation and get to work.

there are no rules. if you feel like running, run. if you feel like Yogasanas, yogasanas.
that's it.
no more "guilt" that you're not doing something the way it should be.

focus solely on generating the outcomes you want. that's it. nothing else.

adopt the lion's mindset.

only leave the room to make tea, yogasanas, or running. that's it.
