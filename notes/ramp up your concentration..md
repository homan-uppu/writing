challenge yourself to do great work from right here. 
make it fucking happen.
self respect is proportional to how well you can do what you say you're going to do.

you've already committed to shipping from here.
now, make it fucking happen. let's get it.

you're underestimating how impactful this great work set up is: you have a fantastic desk setup, and blazing fast internet that enables you to do great work. you can't replicate this elsewhere easily - esp if you're only going to be there for a short period of time.

double down right fucking here. make it happen. commit. let's get it.

if the mind wanders, subdue it through Samadhi and bring it back to where it fucking needs to be. this phase is an incredible opportunity to train this skill... arguably the most important skill of all. let's get it.
