1. **get essay to a point at which i can no longer improve it**. it does not even if this takes another week or so. this sort of iteration towards sufficient perfection will teach you a great deal about what it means to write well. achieve the exceptional quality in both thinking and presentation.
2. **reach out** to 30 people who I respect asking for feedback on this essay.
	1. hint at my exploration of a new kind of personal token, and some feedback on how to go about it.
3. **in parallel:** 
	1. focus on the personal token: what does this look like, and how to launch it. this will require a good deal of research as well.
	2. write another essay as well (perhaps the seeking truth collection, or more thinking on the individual brand). actually, you will likely need to scrap this effort and just double down on the personalized token. need to go all in. be lopsided. only write what is relevant to the personal token.
	3. find a cheeky way to raise money on a personal token.

this is as far out as you can see. there's no need to plan further. in fact, planning further would be detrimental. execute.
