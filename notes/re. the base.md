the only options i really have:
- blr
- hyd

and that's it. i'm not going to go to some "exotic" nature place in India bec i've realized that they're all quickly becoming tourist traps, and living with the locals comes with its own pitfalls (very difficult to find the right environment, etc. - and even if you do, you're going to get sucked into their lives a bit much - that is your tendency! i don't think that's a bad tendency whatsoever - it's something that helps me connect with others, but at the same time i require sufficient seclusion in order to ship great work - which is absolutely required at the moment).

i also want a stellar work set up that is like a temple: where i can have incredible grind sessions.

i believe i can make BLR work really well for me. esp because i have the Yoga shala where i can get my daily practice in, and because BLR has exceptional infra for productivity: incredible internet, great furniture at great deals (since it's the greatest Tech center for billions of people - South Asia).

BLR has high quality products: whether it's premium organic food, great cafes for the occasional cup, density: everything you need is closely packed together, and stupid fast SLA for most services you need: food, grocery delivery, household chores (e.g. Urbanclap house cleaning / bathroom cleaning), etc.

HYD has a strong adv from a capital efficiency perspective. but, i don't think you should over-index on that sort of frugality (or rather, frugality beyond a certain point) during this phase. value your time very highly. and be willing to spend for tangible boost in productivity.

the thing is, i just don't want to be in Hyd. it doesn't have the degree of ambition that BLR has (which itself **pales** in comparison to SF). Hyd also comes with it the baggage of being an insider - things can get comfortable with the support that family provides. i feel that i become soft when i live with fam. it's not good for me.
