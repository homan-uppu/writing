you have abundant nature, a running path for nice, long runs (can easily clock in 10k - and there's absolutely no vehicular traffic). you can get to the nice parts of the city in a 30 - 40 min drive (max). you can design a great daily meal. there's already a house help system to do all the chores. there's absolutely nothing else required than to temper your own cravings. the war is within.
