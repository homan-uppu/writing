are you going to go through with this or not?

reasons to:

it was my original name. in this quest to find your natural expression, you ought to embrace your original unique self - which starts with your name. the reason they changed your name is because they thought Homan was too unique / weird for the world, and it's better to go with something more common that better fits in. i don't ever want to do something just to fit in, and therefore i don't accept this reason for changing my name. i'm going to go back to my original name, and with it, i'm going to try and embody my carefree, natural child-like self that wasn't yet tainted by conformity.

reason not to:
- it makes it more difficult to leverage existing network. but honestly, i don't see this as much of a problem: for the people i care about, i can give them an explanation. and for the larger network, well, they'll learn about my new name when my brand reaches them before i do (which may happen if i consistently do great work over a long period of time).

decided: rebranding to Homan.

now, should it be **Homan Uppu**, or **Homan Uppuluri**?

i'm leaning towards Homan Uppu because it's shorter and sweeter. But, sticking with Uppuluri may have its benefits because it more easily ties this name with your actual name (in the case when you may have to show that you are still legally Karthik Uppuluri).

2 ways to look at it: 
- from a username perspective, i don't want the full last name - go with uppu.
- from a "name" perspective (e.g. on X, or within your website), go with the full last name.
