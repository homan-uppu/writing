3 hours a day. timed.
not a minute less.
get earplugs to drown out the nonsense noises, and keep sitting in the puja room.

after 1 month, make this 4 hours.
and after a few months, turn this into 5 hours a day.

trust me, you will be exponentially more productive at 5 hours a day than you are right now. because the bottleneck is not execution duration, but the quality of ideas. the more true this statement becomes, the more hours you ought to spend working directly with the mind.
