i'm shifting the priority towards writing - with serious, but limited practice.

### practice
1. Daily Ashtanga practice: start very, very small: just Suryanamaskars + Pranayama. Alternatively, do a solid hike up the mountain every morning. that'd be one crazy workout, i can promise that. and if you need a stronger workout, you just keep going higher.
2. Get in 4 hours of solid meditation before starting the writing session.
3. interweave sits between writing sessions. 90 minutes of writing, 60 minutes of meditation.
4. take daily hike up the mountain post lunch - to help digest.

### mindset
- 100%, perfect adherence, Sila.
- Maintain strong, piercing concentration throughout the day.
- Make the body strong. Become a beast.
