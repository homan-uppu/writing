say NO to the world until this manifesto is complete. i have absolutely no idea how long this will take. i'm going to show up every single day to work on it. and i won't stop until it's complete.

i HAVE to write this out. this is the foundation for all the work that i will do. i literally can't see any other way. there is no other path. this is the path of following my excitement.
