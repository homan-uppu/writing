the first visualization to set up is a network:
- a node for each PT in the chain.
- a curved line connecting the nodes.

once you have a Network:
- be able to make a node go "poof" - use poof gif effect. and show its value pop up like a video game experience / damage pop up.
- be able to route the green "capital" through the relevant lines connecting the nodes.

and that's really all you need to get started.

what is a node?

- profilePic
- name
- type

that's it.
