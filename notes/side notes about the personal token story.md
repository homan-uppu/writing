- Paint the rich and old as the enemies and speak on behalf of ambitious, not wealthy, young people. Build a portrait of the common enemy.
- Show the path to extract money from them through their own greed, not due to benevolence. -> e.g. even wanting to tax wealth more is relying on benevolence: many older people have significant wealth in assets they've accumulated when the economy was easier to accumulate wealth in. Expecting them to vote in ways that gives away that wealth is foolish, and even if does happen, will take a long, long time to pass and be implemented.
