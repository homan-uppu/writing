take the time to find and build the right place. the right place makes all the difference. it takes some time to adapt to a region. there's no need to rush things.

that morning walk was incredible. it really "opened" me up. the air, the sun, the exercise. it all came together. in a beautiful way. these are the kinds of mornings that i need.

while i'm convinced this isn't the right place to be, i'm hesitant to discount the mountains entirely. with the right routine, this place can be magical. i also prefer sufficient solitude. i feel like i **need** it during this phase. it will take time for the mind to accept the situation, to settle, and only then will the grind flow. you must be a little bit patient, while also being aggressive towards making sure you don't take more time than is necessary.

so, what's the gameplan? **explore some options here itself**. start to rule them out one by one and see what you're left with.

this place is not it. unfortunately, i'm not convinced hyd is either. but, i can't see a better route?

the problem with Banglore is that the quality of people (from the perspective of creativity and ambition) is simply mediocre. there isn't any other way to look at it.

all of this being said, i definitely want a place i can call my own. yet, every place i stay at feels so temporary. i only have access to Thatha's place for 3.5 months, after which Thatha's ceremony is coming up.

weirdly, this place might work. that short hike was beautiful. i could see myself taking it on every break. but, yeah, no, this place won't work. that's for sure.

execute fucking harder. get out of this financial situation. this is no longer something you can drag on / postpone.

this environment (and i'm also including Uttarkashi, etc.) is WAY too chill. not a good thing tbh. this is why the most serious individuals are either in complete isolation, or only with a few who push them to be even better. there is no other way to play this game if you're very serious.

where to get the most

there's a powerful expression here. amen.
find it.
it's honestly... right there. just have to grab it.

spend more time with people. i think as much as you might not want to over-expose yourself to people on mis-aligned paths, it's still beneficial to get some socialization every now and then... but honestly, more meditation does this as well because it is also a form of socialization: with yourself.

but, honestly, i think the benefit is better attributed to the nature: sunlight, fresh air, etc. not the socialization. agreed. keep the socialization to a minimum. keep within yourself.
