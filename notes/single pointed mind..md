Being able to keep your mind where you want it to be, for however long you want it there, is possibly the most powerful skill an individual can cultivate.

A mind that is collected, composed, free from distractions and one with the object of concentration.

You'd be able to move your mind away from negative cycles that cause you suffering such as anger, envy, sadness, etc.

You'd be able to do what you want to do without the rumination of the past, and worries of the future.

The more deeply absorbed you are in what you're doing, the less your fears and anxieties control you from the subconscious.
