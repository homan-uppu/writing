i don't want to move anywhere.
i want to stay put and create a great studio work environment right here itself. anything else becomes a massive distraction.

i also don't want to over-expose myself to all the pollution of traveling. it doesn't feel worth it.

at the same time, i don't necessarily want to be here.

then, why not Thatha's for a month and see what happens? amen.
