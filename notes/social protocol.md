i don't ever want to engage in discussions with family again.

i need to be more careful about who i spend time with. the people you interact with influence you in many ways - many of which you can't even directly notice.

if i look at all of the interactions and discussions, debates i had with fam over the past few days, only a few were worth it: my chats with Abhived, Saathwik, Vishwa. they are gems of beings with great potential and working hard towards getting what they want. they're inspiring.

the rest of the conversations were utter wastes of time. pointless. meaningless. and worse: outright damaging.

i need a new social protocol that maximizes the positive conversations.

firstly: avoid all unnecessary chatter. this is the crux of noble speech and one of the most important aspects of the path. noble speech is so damn important. unnecessary, unproductive conversations are killers. maintain as much silence as possible when confronted with situations in which there is senseless chatter about. do not participate in such conversations.

you have to be really locked in to be able to exercise strong judgement, discernment and most importantly restraint in order to practice noble speech.

always be locked in. you can't afford to take moments "lightly". be locked in. execute.

**specific protocol:**
- **avoid any and all family gatherings**. i will not be going to any event, no matter how important (wedding, death ceremonies, etc.) for my family members unless it's for parents. i owe nothing to my extended family.
- **there will not be another large family gathering function in my family** (3 of us) (except for deaths). my wedding if it happens will be a very small scale event with perhaps just the parents on both sides. and, if this does happen, it will be entirely funded by us without any external support.
	- in case Amma wants to have a musical function, puja, or something else, i will not participate, but will do my best to extend some logistical support (by deploying capital and hiring someone great for the task).
- **remove all communication channels for unwanted fam.** - this is actually super important. i need a new number basically. or, i need to get off of whatsapp.
	- completely. aside from parents, and the ones i do want to be in touch with, there should be no way to reach me. need to design something here.
	- till you achieve this, COMPLETELY IGNORE any messages from people i don't want to ever engage with.
