- tomorrow, force yourself to wake up early (or not sleep at all), so that you can reset it tomorrow night onwards. this isn't healthy whatsoever. make this happen. this current schedule is harming my health: mental and physical.
- do a sesh at the library every single day. an analog session. you have a wonderful space that encourages concentration. this can be special. make the most of it. at the very least, try it out!
