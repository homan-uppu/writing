You're not sure when the path will work out. You're not sure if you are going to have the winning solution. You're not sure if the next step you're taking is the right one.

So much uncertainty. So much looking into the void. And most of the time, the void doesn't say anything back to you. Silence is the worst.

You'd much rather have the world hate what you're doing than to be constantly ignored.
