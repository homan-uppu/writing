What is education / history:
- purpose of education itself - it is for people to be able to create value, so that they can afford the experiences that they want. this "equation" isn't going to change anytime soon (even with UBI).
- what the economy wants determines what is taught, and how it is taught. Modern education is a product that was designed for the industrial age. The world needed many people who could follow instructions, to work mechanically, to be able to turn valuable ideas into reality. In a world in which execution is the bottleneck, people were trained to bridge that gap. 
- White collar work has predominantly been just as "average" as any other kind of work: menial, grunt work. Which is why even today education is focused on teaching frameworks / formulas to execute ideas - rarely does it (or can it) teach you how to have great ideas.
- The whole education "teaches you how to think / learn" is mostly bullshit. People can say all they want about what they hope education should be, but the reality has always been that our education system is a machine to churn out individuals who can fit neatly into systems of value creation as small, replaceable, cogs. The "leaders" that colleges and MBA programs claim to create mostly end up becoming middle management cogs... not much better (and often times much worse) than the regular cogs. Yet, cogs they all are.

AI:
- Artificial intelligence is the one "cog" that replaces them all. This fundamentally invalidates education itself.
- But, more importantly, AI makes our economy more extreme.
