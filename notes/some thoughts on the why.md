As artificial intelligence becomes more powerful, our work will require greater creativity than ever before since AI will do the less creative work for us.

Our work becoming more creative is a sign of progress. We are meant to be creative. AI will unshackle us from the repetitive, laborious work that has dominated our endeavors for millennia, launching us into the age of creativity.

But, outcomes for creative work follow the power law distribution: most value is created by a small number of the best. The more creative the task, the more participants, and the better the education for all, the more extreme the power law distribution: more value created by the top, and a lower the median outcome - the average will struggle to create enough value. <Annotation>further reading: [Why VC will be the best way to finance learning](https://www.homan.sh/vc-learning).</Annotation>

The power law distribution is an inseparable feature of creative work. We already see the power law distribution in creative fields: arts, filmmaking, content creation, business, sports, etc. As AI makes all of our work more creative, we will see the power law manifest in all human endeavors.

Our economic system was not designed for creative work. For example, financing education through loans doesn't work for highly creative fields because most graduates will not make a living from it (similar to how, say, most filmmaking students won't be able to make a living as directors). Buying homes on loans doesn't work because creative work doesn't have the same kind of stability & security that non-creative work has.

Our entire loan & credit based economic system is on the verge of collapse. The worst hit will be those who don't already have wealth. Though AI will enable us to tackle our greatest challenges, on top of our current economic system, AI will likely amplify the opportunity gap between those who have wealth and the rest who will be too burdened & distracted by debt to be able to make good use of AI.

Unequal access to opportunity hurts all of us.

In the age of creativity, with an extreme power law distribution of productivity, the best way to democratize opportunity is through venture capital. When individuals can raise capital by giving up equity in the wealth they will create, instead of taking on debt, they can share risk with investors and be unshackled by debt.
