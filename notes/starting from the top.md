*INTRO*
- AI is poised to fundamentally change the way our economy operates, attacking our education system at its core: at the level of its business model itself.
- what "replaces" our current education system will look weird at first, but i can't see any other possibility given the world is changing. this essay is a vision for the future of education and some thoughts on how we will get there.

*ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE*
- AI makes outcomes extreme.
- power law distribution: winner takes all. no room for average
- this happens because AI fundamentally increases the complexity of our work. and the more complex a task becomes, the more its outcomes follow the power law distribution. (*complexity, creativity, & the power law*)
- creativity and the power law go hand in hand.
- does this mean that not everyone can contribute to the economy? isn't the world positive sum? (not sure if this is necessary).
- in theory this sounds plausible, but practically speaking, it's impossible.
- AI scales individual expression. higher bar for differentiation. (why is this even important to mention?).

*EDUCATION'S BUSINESS MODEL INVALIDATED*
- this shift attacks the core business model of education: selling it as a product. paying for education does not work in a world with extreme outcomes in which most will struggle to create value with what they've learned.
- curriculum or even teaching style, while are important concerns, are not the primary problem we have because even with the best curriculum, the best teachers, outcomes will still be extreme.
- the way to finance education itself is broken!
- it's difficult to internalize this shift because we haven't yet seen anything like it. yes, you can say that the power law already exists in content creation, startups, etc. but the point is that there have always been other avenues to generate an income with less extreme dynamics. and in fact, that is what has sustained a good chunk of startups and content creation: the founders have saved up a bit through work with less extreme outcomes to enable them to take greater risks.
- if this trend is true, we should be seeing early signs. there are many.
	- bootcamps & ISAs is one of them.

*A NEW SYSTEM*
- venture capital and extreme outcomes (power law distribution) go hand in hand. investments spread across many bets become profitable if even one goes big.
- in a post-AI world, venture capital is the best way to finance education, NOT buying education as a product, but treating it as a financial investment in exchange for equity in outcomes.
- these outcomes must be their equity in companies (and potentially other assets). why? because most wealth is created through equity, not salary. without 
- how could this look like? one approach is through a financial instrument that represents an individual's outcomes, that is divided into shares that can be sold to investors to give them equity in outcomes.
- at the outset: 
- second order consequences:
	- educational institutes that operate as "accelerators".
	- teachers become investors.
	- the range of your board is the range of your "education". e.g. a founder, an expert marketer, a designer, etc.

*2030*
- the world of venture capital and startups will become the defacto "model" of the entire global order. nations that embrace Extremistan will prosper.
