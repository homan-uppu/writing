just have the entire infrastructure taken care of for you and do nothing else.
though i'm not sure if it's good for my health (all kinds of health).

why do you feel this way? is it the distractions? not sure what it is.

i think it's the ability to just grind and have everything else taken care of for me. that's a productive feeling.

i can also use that as homebase and travel to SEA whenever i feel like - the connectivity is great, and it feels quite affordable.

but, it's definitely going to make you soft. especially if you still have to build clarity on the direction.
