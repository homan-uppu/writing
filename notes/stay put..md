no place else makes sense at the moment.

you have a fantastic work set up right here.

you have OU in case you want to get back to running. (or you could even buy a bicycle and ride through OU in the mornings, but nah, i like running more than biking).

you can literally turn the living room into a studio space (or even better: turn Thatha's room into a studio space - that room works out really well tbh, from a lighting standpoint: completely isolated from the rest of the house. just need a lighting setup, a desk, mic setup, and an air purifier and you're good to go).

and you have the time that you need. this space is available till August at the least. that's 5 whole months brother. ofc, i'm going to do my best to bounce ASAP, but i'm saying it's available in the sense that it might even make sense to fly back here to use the space if i want a solid, low burn, grind session. amen.
- e.g. a 1 month US trip to meet folks, and then fly back to grind out of here. that can work.

any cent spent on traveling is **better spent on creating**.
this is absolutely true.

i'd be much happier spending money on a home studio, etc. than i would be on a trip to, say, BKK.

also, i don't want to travel "on a budget". i hate that thought. when i travel, i want to travel freely - without having to think about money / a budget... that's the only way to travel.

embrace the voluntary house arrest.
and don't hold back from letting people know if they ask you to come somewhere.
i've committed to this.
there is no other way.

my exit criteria is abundantly clear.
just have to execute to make it happen.
amen.
