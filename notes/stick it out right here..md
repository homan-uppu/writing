enough giving into the cravings of moving.
too much moving around is making you unproductive.
focus on right here, right now.

commit, with strong determination, to shipping the following before you give yourself the option to move someplace:

1. **essays**: personal-token and vc-learning drafts sufficiently complete so that you can start socializing them.
2. **reach out to 100 people** that you'd want feedback from. create a solid "outreach engine" that enables you to "save" people to your DB and systematically reach out to them. - this system is a critical long-term investment. do this well.
3. a short film to present the concept of personal tokens to the world. this is a launching pad for the project. it has to be an EXCELLENT piece of filmmaking.

---

every cent you spend from here on out must directly reflect in the quality of the project.

be very patient brother. be patient.
