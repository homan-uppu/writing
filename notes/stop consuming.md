you're back in the zone of overconsumption.
it's really not healthy.
you need to be consuming far less in order to be at optimal.
you need to create according to what YOU are, not what the world wants you to be. and there's still more exploration and understanding that is required to lay the right foundation.

so yeah, get back to writing. i'm getting the sense that perhaps you need a break? but, if that is the case, then you might as well meditate more. one or the other. mindless, overconsumption only wears you down more, without giving anything worthwhile in return.s
