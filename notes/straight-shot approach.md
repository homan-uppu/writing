1. write a comprehensive manifesto: "a plan to change the world".
2. make a film about this: however long it needs to be to share my entire plan to change the world.
3. craft a single ask at the end of the plan: invest $1m in my personal token if you want to support this cause.

straight-shot it. the ask at the end of the video is $10m.
craft the film exceptionally well. use all the resources available to you in Hyderabad to bring it to life. don't hold back whatsoever in the production of this piece. and take the time you need to do an exceptionally good job. amen.
trust your instinct. don't hold back. you can't afford to hold back any longer.

aim for the full release by May 18, 2025, around 12:51pm IST. make it happen.

next steps:
1. quickly write a draft / outline. just put down all of your thinking about this (which you've been having for a while now).
2. **bring some clarity to the manifesto**. study the Unabomber manifesto and any others out there that would be good to draw some inspiration from.
3.

- use up to 50lacs to create the film, and distribute it to the world. amen.
- take as long as you need to in order to do this well.
- nature is pushing me to be more ambitious, to think bigger. i shall surrender to it.
