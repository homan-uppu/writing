hey Subbu Mama, was very nice seeing you, aunty and Saathwik at the housewarming.

i know you're quite busy these days, but please let me know if / when you have some time for a one-on-one conversation. i want to learn more about your journey (especially the 11 year wait that you mentioned), and absorb your learnings. i feel like there's a lot i can learn, and it feels quite relevant given where i'm at right now. 

thanks.
