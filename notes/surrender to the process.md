the thing about this process is that the timeline is out of your control. you can only do what you can do. follow your system, and maximize the opportunity for luck. there's no other path here.

aim to get strong results in weeks, but balance the mind by internally preparing for it to take months. this is such a difficult internal balance. i see a lot of similarities to The path and this path. balancing the internal state amidst all of this uncertainty sure is an important skill.

be open to the possibilities... which only comes from a sufficiently concentrated, aware, and balanced mind. keep the training up. that is the only way you can succeed on this path. it's going to be outright brutal. be very patient my friend.
