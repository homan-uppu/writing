what could this look like?

i don't like any of these options if i'm being honest.
i'm priced out of the good places.
and i'm not a fan of the not-so-good places.
in 3rd world: fresh air, clean water, moderate temperature, fast internet. pick 2 / 4. lol.

## 3 months in Tokyo / Seoul.
- it's going to be fucking freezing lol.

## 3 months in SEA.
re-evaluate every 3 months - whether to go to the next country / continue there.
- Saigon
- Bangkok
- KL
of these i'd prob only want to do Saigon. but, you're forgetting the degree of pollution there. it's not great.

## move straight to SF.
burn at 3k / month - giving you 6 months to make something happen. - an incredibly stupid move without having a clear plan of execution and runway in place.

## great apartment in BLR
- a flat near a park i can go on regular walks at. close to great cafes to spend a couple of hours a day grinding out of. close to the Yoga shala for a daily am sesh. can get a great 1bhk for 30 - 40k / mo. i'm down to pay that. you get a lot for being in that area. i know i'd love to do a sesh at a cafe every morning (9am - noon) - that would be wonderful. come home, cook lunch, and a solid grind till the eve. i'd dig that. you can manage the water problem, etc.

## great apartment in HYD
- staying in a metro would be better for the infrastructure. Hyd DD colony makes sense - let's you go on the daily run through OU early am. that's a good way to get the day started, and lets you get all the sun / air you need to spend the rest of the day at home.
	- though would be nice to try and rent a place in DD colony rather than stay at Thatha's - a place that no one knows about / can come to. that would be ideal.

## Netala / Himalayas

the best place is where you are at the moment. if you can find a way to bear the cold (by layering up even more perhaps), then you'll be somewhat fine. it takes effort, and a will, but it is doable. for sure. you can even invest in a nice chair if that would make a difference.
