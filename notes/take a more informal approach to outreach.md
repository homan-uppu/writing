- just manage a list in markdown ([[OUTREACH|OUTREACH]]).
- add to it in bullet points.
- move from todo -> done. and that's it.

reason: there's no need to keep following up on a regular basis - esp if they've already seen the message. give people space.

keep the overhead v. v. low for now.

also: reach out earlier than you currently are. it's ok if it lands in their inbox at 3 / 4am - it'll be towards the top when they wake up. you can also schedule send in Superhuman so that it arrives exactly at 7am or whatever. basically... move faster lol.
