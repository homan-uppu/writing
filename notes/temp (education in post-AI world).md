### AI makes education far more expensive

Another popular theory floating around is that AI will democratize high quality education for everyone. But in reality, the cost of the kind of education that meaningfully improves someone’s chances of becoming good enough to create economic value will skyrocket.

The more complex the skill, the more difficult and expensive it becomes to effectively train for that skill, and the fewer great teachers are available to teach the skill. There are many who can effectively train factory workers and even software engineering in a pre-AI world, but how many can effectively teach someone to be a good enough content creator such that they can make a living from creating content? Very few.

The more complex a skill is, the less you can follow a predetermined set of instructions to become good enough at it. A decade ago, you could learn a programming language, a software framework, have a couple of example projects in your portfolio and land a job. Today, you would need to have a knack for what to build, a strong design and product sense as well. It’s incredibly difficult to train the latter - heck most professional software engineers with decades of experience still suck at these skills.

Those who are capable of effectively teaching / mentoring for highly complex skills are rare, and their time is worth far more than what most students can pay for. For example, a teacher who can improve someone’s chances of building a successful startup, or creating viral content by even 5% would be able to earn millions on the market, why would they teach a student for any less? Another way to look at it: since outcomes are extreme, successes are larger, and therefore the value of increasing the chance of success by even a small factor is incredibly valuable.

The converse is also true: in a post-AI world, a teacher willing to teach for something a student can afford to pay for is almost certainly not a good enough teacher who won’t be able to impact the student’s outcomes at all.

Therefore, in a post-AI world, paying for education doesn’t work because most will not be able to earn it back (no room for average), AND because the cost of the kind of education that does make a difference will skyrocket.

Without a new way to finance education, opportunity will be further concentrated in the hands of those who have the wealth to afford the best education, and who can afford to explore various things to find their unique, differentiated, talent that they can hone to create value in the world. Without a different system, the billions who will be riddled with debt will not have the space to tinker, and explore to have a fair shot at creating value in the world.

- in fact, the top colleges graduate such a small number of people that it’s just a rounding error on the total number of students in the world that we can ignore them entirely for the sake of this discussion. they don’t even matter.
    

### A new business model for education

Paying to learn will not work for most people - I.e anyone who does not come from wealth, who are required to earn back their investment in their educations. Because most people, by definition, are average, and there is no room for the average to create value. Paying for college will become similar to paying for a degree in art - a privilege for the wealthy (and perhaps those ignorant of how the world works) but impractical for most.

And therefore we can’t just scale our education system to a post AI world by just improving its curriculum because the main problem now isn’t even in the curriculum it’s in the underlying business model and incentives that simply don’t work for extreme outcomes.

…

Let’s now explore how to “reconstruct” education on top of this new business model - which is the only viable business model for education in a post-AI world.

What are the components of education?

### A new financial instrument: personal tokens

  
### address failure of centralized institutions

this is a v. important piece to tackle.

### New vs. old system

(a side by side comparison of someone with potential going through the old education system vs. someone going through the new one - with personal tokens, and collecting teachers along the way).

### UBI

But isn't the world a positive-sum game, meaning there should be room for everyone to create value? In theory, there may be room for everyone. In practice, it's almost impossible because:
1. Most won't discover their unique abilities during their lifetimes, and therefore will become an average performer competing in games they weren't designed to play.
2. Some individual's natural talent - their differentiation - isn't that valued by the world. Someone, say, who's fascinated by some niche thing that few others care about may not be able to create much value in this economy. They will then be forced to compete in a more lucrative skill where they will be outcompeted by those who are naturally inclined to excel at it.

### Timeline

-> need a note here about exponential acceleration of AI, which determines the degree of differentiation required. They are directly correlated. This is important to highlight.

- therefore, the education we will explore is a bit into the future: 

(perhaps this section can come much later).

- very important to clarify that these changes will take time. it will not happen overnight - especially in the realm of atoms.
