We already have such a system: the startup ecosystem. Startups are companies that are designed to grow fast, and create enormous value. In order to enable such growth, many startups raise money through investors who give startups money in exchange for equity in the company. This type of financing (capital in exchange for equity) is called venture capital (VC). VC is the best means of financing in domains that follow the power law distribution of outcomes, and the best outcomes are very high. An investor that invests in 100 companies may only need one to win massively for them to make a sizable profit. Generally, VC aligns incentives well: the investor only makes a profit if the company is valued more than what it was when they invested in it. 

  

VC will be the best financing model for education as well in a world in which all work becomes highly creative with an extreme power law distribution of outcomes.

  

Venture capital implies having a company. Does this mean that the future of education will require everyong to start their own companies? I'm seeing sharp young high schoolers figure out that college no longer makes financial sense and they instead choose to directly create value in the world through online businesses and startups. Some go onto raise capital to enable them to sustain themselves while working on their ideas. These builders are finding ways to sustain themselves as they train 

  

Yet, building businesses / startups is one path out of many interesting, valuable (for both themselves and the collective) paths that an individual can take. And also, what about those that show signs of great potential, but aren't yet ready to start a company. Maybe they're interested in deep tech research that will take them a much longer time to become proficient at compared to learning how to build mobile apps. Or perhaps they want to study the global financial system in depth. Or perhaps they're a budding [podcaster who wants to explore their natural curiosities](https://meridian.mercury.com/dwarkesh-patel) by talking to interesting people. What if they’re late bloomers?

  

Some valuable paths take longer to come to fruition and are less investable in the traditional startup investing sense. Yet, these individuals too will create generational companies, achieve scientific breakthroughs and artistic achievements, though they're not in a position to start a company today and raise money for it.

  

As of today, such individuals have two options: rely on family wealth to fund their explorations, or rely on grants (such as the Thiel Fellowship and Emergent ventures). If they don't have access to capital to fund their learning, they're at a severe disadvantage because that means they can only follow their natural curiosities outside of the time they have to spend dealing with the traditional education system.
