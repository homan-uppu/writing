there's something peculiar about the phase that i'm currently in. it feels like a lull. kind of like how in a meditation session you lose track of time because your mind has wandered somewhere in an unmindful way, and it's only when you come back that you realize that it had been gone in the first place. i'm feeling that the mind has been "gone" for the past few days.

i suspect the problem is over-patience. i'm too comfortable in this space, in this routine. and because my burn is low, i'm prepared to take this phase as long as it takes. this "however long it takes" mindset itself may be the problem because i'm too patient.

a sense of urgency is an invaluable asset.

so, what's the alternative? what changes would be good to make?

the first thing to understand is: what pulls you out of the lull?

**i see two approaches:**
1. **build momentum**. - the work that you're doing starts to pick up: more conversations, traction, fundraising, etc.
2. **greater fear of survival**. - you feel an existential urgency that if you don't get traction quickly, you're fucked.

both approaches are actually the same: two sides of the same coin. momentum increases fear because you don't want to miss out on the opportunity you see. greater fear leads to greater focus and intensity, creating momentum.

Monks have talked about this balance: Samvega & Passadhi.
- Samvega = shock, dismay, urgency to escape suffering.
- Passadhi = calm, serene, confidence in the path leading to the end of suffering.

Samvega without the sufficient Passadhi leads to impatience & agitation - which actually slows you down from achieving your goal. there's a fine balance here. i feel that i'm lacking sufficient Samvega right now. i'm too comfortable with the way things are, which is a huge problem.

**momentum**:
4. **feedback & conversations** about the idea with people who resonate strongly with the idea and crave to see it come to life. -> this is incredibly energizing.
5.
