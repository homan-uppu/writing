a life more seriously aligned with the practice. the life of a monk. within which you make time for your expression, not the other way around.

look at the ways Ramana, Shankar, Premananda, etc. designed their lives... there's something powerful about living such a life. it strengthens the mind. makes it self-sufficient. it makes it powerful.

studying and understanding reality as it is, the truth as it presents itself, is the most valuable use of time. there is no justification for not spending more time on this. but, this is the path.

what changes do you need in your life to be able to live in this way?
the first thing to do is to simply sit more. you don't need much more than this. it's only after sitting significantly - when you reach some limitations with this environment - when you ought to consider moving to someplace more conducive to the practice. no?

you could also look at it differently: moving someplace more conducive to the practice is the right starting point because of how much of a beginner you are. you don't have to do this if you're not a beginner because then you can practice any and every where.

you could very well move to the mountains and set up a space that is very conducive to both the practice and you work. though, naturally, you will need to make some sacrifices when it comes to work: the internet won't be nearly as fast, you prob won't have a great desk / chair set up, etc. and all of this may slow down your progress on your work. there's no denying that possibility. but, you may end up being much more productive because of the state of mind you will craft. on the net, it could be significantly more productive. it's difficult to say. this is not something you can analyze your way to an answer. you'll need to rely on the gut instinct, and also experiment: by trying and evaluating.
