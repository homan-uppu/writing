what's clear:
- can't stay here longer. this is entering peak tourist season. it's the last place that makes sense.

options:
- in the **mountains**:
	- NamaStay: independent cabin with my own desk. and naturally, there is no internet in the cabin, so for any internet related work i can just come to the common area to knock out. this might be a good experiment, but i'm not really sold on this just yet.
	- what other places even make sense?
- **Netala**, Uttarkashi:
	- i'm hesitant. the season is about to start there as well. many people coming for their hit of "spirituality" whatever the fuck that means. both for the Yoga course at the kutir, as well as in general will find many gore log at the homestays. Tapasyalayam is also open and will likely attract groups of visitors. trust me, the surroundings of the area you're going to rent will be absolutely packed with all sorts of visitors. this isn't the environment that you think it will be. seriously.
- **HSR**, BLR:
	- pros:
		- yogasanas
		- weather
		- productivity infra
		- group sits
	- cons:
		- absolutely unnecessary burn. like, such a stupid use of time, money, etc.
		- living situation will be temporary. finding a permanent one will be far too time consuming.
 - **Bagh Amberpet** / DD colony, HYD
	 - pros: 
		 - low burn.
		 - great raw productivity infra.
		 - get in a 10k run every single morning. totally do-able. not just doable, but required if you're going to maintain strong health.
		 - even after 3 months, you can just rent another flat in the same apartment. so yeah, there is some continuity. amen.
	 - cons:
		 - v. temporary living situation. not my place technically, so anyone can come whenever the fuck they and i can't say shit. this is actually quite problematic if you ask me.
 - **Mokila**, HYD:
	 - not yet. i don't want to get sucked into this yet. there will be a lot of work to set this up well. i don't have the bandwidth for this yet. let it be fully complete, and then will move everything over on some Sunday. but even then, i want my own space... i think that space is important to have. amen.
