bare necessities:
- good weather - not extreme. bias towards colder.
- fresh air. minimal exposure to pollution (you underestimate the impact of pollution on your ability to think).
- ample sunlight.
- walking / hiking / running opportunity. - keep moving. use your body how it's meant to be used: i.e. not forcefully stuck inside of a cave like environment (i.e. Thatha's place).

work:
- internet (at least 40 mbps).
- a comfortable sitting position. don't even need a desk + chair. even a comfortable sofa is more than good enough. keep changing your position.

notes:
- being close to nature, a strong meditation practice, hikes in nature, rising with the sun, are far, far, far more important than a great desk / chair / fast internet (e.g. 500 mbps). because the bottleneck isn't the tool, it's your mind. this is a key realization. a calm, collected, mind will be able to see, to perceive, possibilities that the agitated mind won't even be able to see. most mediocre middle management / outdated engineers, designers, etc. all have great work setups with fancy monitors, keyboards, top-of-the-line chairs, etc. all to enable producing slop. optimize for the right things... i.e. the things that matter.

**options**:
- Netala: rent the apt. next to Krishnananda's homestay. take it for one month. deck it out with solid internet (that 300 mbps that's possible). buy a small desk and chair.
	- Use the Bhairav mandir as your meditation spot... clock in at least 2 * 90 min sessions there on the daily - one in the am, the other in the aft.
	- you could even create a small shed on top of the homestay to grind out of... at the same time, it wouldn't be too difficult to design and control your own workspace (which i would prefer - don't want to have to go to the Homestay each time i need the internet. **minimize dependencies**).
	- one chai + lunch daily at the homestay.
	- buy some physical books for reading during downtimes (do NOT consume social media. eliminate that from your life). - basically create a welcoming, creative, space.
	- any free time ought to be spent with nature. with yourself.
- Hyderabad: take ownership of the office room. move the table and chair from Ammamma's, and take the time to get everything set up well. get the room deep cleaned. craft an inspiring studio space.
- Banglore: a solid 1bhk in HSR. **set up a great space to grind out of**. Ashtanga yogasanas in the morning. a session at Blue Tokai. grind hard at home.
	- the big problem is that for all the setting up i do, i might have to leave it all behind within a couple of weeks. my lack of a concrete timeline is what is really bothersome if i'm being honest.

**ruled out:**
- continue at NamaStay (Kanatal) - this place can meet my requirements. and it can be quite long-term if you need it to be. actually no, scratch that. i'm not a fan of the kind of guests that come here, and with which purpose they come here. it's really not the kind of environment that i want to be in. i need the greatest solitude and a much more serious environment for execution. amen.
- Bangkok, Saigon / anywhere else in the world.
	- doesn't make any sense now bec. it's just way too much burn. like, seriously.

so... what's the deal? back to Hyd today or sticking around in the mountains?
