For most of my adult life, I've lived a certain lifestyle - similar to the one that i'm living right now. it's defined by a balance of work, interspersed with pastimes such as content consumption, socialization, watching sports, and whatever other nonsense that i've involved myself with, along with a minimal practice (1 - 2 hours of meditation per day).

life has gone by, but i don't feel that i've maximized my potential. in fact, i believe i've significantly underperformed relative to what i believe my potential to be.

i am my worst enemy. i have literally no one else to blame. i've been given all the privileges that one could possibly have in life. every. single. one. a loving, caring family, one of the best educations in the world, exposure to a transformative practice for self development at the turn of turning 20, relatively great health, not in debt, people who i love, trust and who love & trust me back. and importantly, i believe i've been given a gift to be able to contribute greatly to humanity's progress. i believe i have it in me. i just... haven't been able to produce it yet because i keep getting in my own way.

my subconscious fears. my cravings. my inability to wield my mind effectively is what has held me back.

to have radically different outcomes, i need a radically different process. i feel like i already know what to do... i've known it for a while. i just haven't done it because of how difficult it is. difficult not just in terms of the practice, but also in terms of accepting how weird it is - far more off beat path than what i'm on. but, i have no choice now. it's either now, or i whither away, wasting away my precious life.

have the courage to follow your natural expression.

### the way of life

the way of life is first and foremost grounded in the practice. 6 hours of meditation per day. out of which a **single 3 hour session**. a single 2 hour session. and a 1 hour session. optimize for connected blocks. deep work matters just as much with the practice as it does for work. build endurance for the deep work.

a single meal a day. a weekly 48 hour fast (i.e. skip the meal once a week).

a long walk / hike / yogasanas / pushups + squats + planks - for daily exercise. keep the body strong.

no caffeine. no milk. just hot water if it's cold. and normal water otherwise.

outside of the practice hours, work. work intensely. work relentlessly. work hard. make the most of each and every moment.

no matter when you sleep, wake up at 4am. clean yourself, and start the first meditation session. even if you have nights where you don't get much sleep, you absolutely must wake up at 4. this discipline is required.

once every fortnight, spend an entire day practicing. maintain the practice throughout all of your actions.

### notes

this is it. quite simple. yet, incredibly difficult. you have no choice in this matter. face yourself. face the Truth. come out stronger.
