- 45 min - 1 hour trail run in pristine nature.
- lunch.
- short hike to digest.
- meditate.
- 4 hour work.
- read / meditate.

honestly, living next to GGP / Panhandle would be absolutely perfect. Go to the city when required (meetings, etc.). Grind at home / cafe for a few hours. Get a great run in during the day. Meditate a lot. Do great work. Bliss.
