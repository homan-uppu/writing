5 - 8:30
- Wake up, drink water, poop, bathe, lounge around, get a short sit in (30 mins ish to give the mind the space to "activate"). (1 hr).
- Ashtanga yoga practice. (1 - 1.5 hours).
- Meditate (1 hour).

and then grind and sit as much as possible. that's it. once you have the start, the foundation, out of the way, everything else easily falls on top. else, you have to take time out later in the day for your health which is a burden - esp when you're in the work zone.
