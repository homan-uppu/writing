it's interesting how difficult it is to hide dismissiveness. you can tell when someone doesn't "approve" of what you're doing, but are being polite about it.

clearly the judgement & bias goes both ways. the way i subconsciously judge aimless wanderers, they judge me for my inner clarity and strong belief that technology can be a powerful force for positive change. they won't even entertain the conversation beyond the point at which they feel i'm a "lost cause".

this is why Sangha is extremely important. the collective bubble of delusion normalizes what would otherwise be seen as too weird. but, all collective bubbles will eventually devolve into a cult because it's rare to find individuals who can think for themselves (and i'm not even claiming to be one of them tbh - i have a long way to go in order to think "for myself"). so yeah, a delusion "bubble" can't be a sustainable solution to this.

perhaps that's why the greats have always described the path as a solitary effort. each individual must walk it on their own. seeking truth is an individual journey.
