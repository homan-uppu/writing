firstly, aim to get **on a flight to SF by the end of Q1 2025** come what may. gun to get traction by then and make it happen. having any other kind of mindset is incredibly suboptimal. aim to be both right and fast.

if this is the game you're playing, all the advantages of BLR don't really matter do they? e.g. 

plus, if you do a place in Mokila itself, you can make it happen < 30k, and that will be your total expenditure bec. everything else is taken care of for you. BLR on the other hand will force you to rack up a monthly 70k bill if you want to live the right lifestyle.

the security deposit doesn't matter because i'll get to a position at which i can forfeit it anyways.

i'm also not keen on any kind of socialization... that is not what this phase is for. or even exposing myself to the cafe scene isn't necessarily something that i want... but, there is still socialization here as well... a kind that i want to completely avoid: i.e. socializing with people i already know.

from a financial standpoint, i can burn 80k / month + (2L security deposit and up front costs) and still have around 5L remaining (which i can stretch indefinitely by living in some rural areas of the country). therefore ramping up burn to have a highly productive place (either in BLR / HYD) is totally worth it. you have to back yourself here.

but yes, not going below 5L is absolutely necessary. that is my final, last, resort and i ideally should not even get close to that.

but, the finances does matter to a degree. by spending 80k / mo, i do give up the ability to spend capital towards projects: e.g. if i want to make a baller promo video, it's going to cost 50k - 1L... there's really no way around this. if you're in BLR, you're not going to be able to dish this out (or actually you will and will just take on the risk).
- yeah, if i see an angle i'm going to pursue it, there's no way around that. so yeah.

ok, so what really are my priorities?
1. health: physically, mentally strong. this is the foundation, and what i've realized is that optimizing for health is the best way to optimize for productivity. nothing else even comes close. the alpha fancy chairs, big monitors etc. is puny compared to the alpha from great health (which leads to great thinking, which is invaluable compared to better tools).
	1. this will require a strict OMAD diet, daily yogasanas, and long meditation sessions throughout the day.
2. great workspace that inspires great work.

what else is there to consider?

so yeah, still undecided. why so indecisive about this? because it could potentially be a long-term commitment and i want to get it right.

i think Hyd is the right move. the thing about BLR is that the infrastructure isn't that good... especially the living situation. things are just newer and higher quality here in Hyd. this will prove especially useful when you have to bring things to life: e.g. high production value videos, or anything for that matter.

what you'll need to pick up is the ability to cook. this is absolutely required. no way around this.

another point to consider: do you think you'll hire during this phase? i can't imagine doing so. if i'm to hire, i'm going to raise beforehand, or have the revenue to justify doing so. nothing in between.

but, if you are to collaborate, then BLR would be significantly better. that's for sure. why do you say this?
