1. this is happening. the mountains are where i'm meant to write this.
2. clear agenda (exit criteria) that i am required to hit before i allow myself to head out from there. it is NOT time based, but rather outcome based. meaning, you might be there for a long, long time, or a very, very short time, depending on how quickly you achieve the outcomes.
3. define your daily schedule: esp around the meditation hours - which is the most important.

	1. download all the books, etc. that you'd want to read.
	2. pack up your supplies here: store away the monitor. give Dad the passports, and drivers license. be all set to leave and never come back.
