- **stay here** - rent out a room in Netala. hook it up with a great internet connection. Buy a great desk and chair. buy heater. use as an office space for the foreseeable future.
	- you can definitely find some furniture. heck, you can go to Dehradun if need be to buy some great furniture and come back with it. and besides, what you're using right now is absolutely dope. you can just create a similar sort of setup within the room.
- **Hyd homebase** and make trips to Asia.
	- e.g. 3 months to **Tokyo / Taipei / Saigon / Seoul** - have a crystal clear goal for what you're going to achieve, and gun to make it happen before you bounce.
		- though, if i am going to be in Tokyo, i would like to learn some Japanese before i go. https://modernlivingjapan.com/property_description?ids=Asakusa%20I301.
		- https://www.habyt.com/ -> feels like high quality, reasonably affordable monthly rentals at the places you'd want to visit.
	- after each trip you will always have an option to come crash in Hyd for a week or so before embarking on the next trip. Saigon for sure would work out < 5k for 3 months. and ofc, the goal would be to achieve escape velocity during that period and book a flight straight to SF from there instead of coming backwards.

i really, really don't want to live in an Indian metro. for the improvement in the technical infrastructure, you sacrifice a big chunk of health (bad water, pollution, etc.). i don't want to have to deal with that whatsoever. at all. it's not worth it. you'd be paying more and losing out on a lot. for that money, i'd much, much rather just go someplace like Saigon. same rates as BLR, but you get so much more bang for your buck. the quality of the premium things there are just much higher than they are in India.

also - i see absolutely no reason to be leaving Netala. yes it's going to get cold, but you can fucking deal with it.
