### overview
in the age of intelligence, people are everything.
a single great mind will be more impactful than billions of average minds.
therefore, the greatest winners in any domain will be those who can discover, attract, and enable the greatest minds to help them realize their goals.

the "relationships product" to facilitate building and growing relationships with other people will be a key tool for anyone who wants anything worthwhile.

i want to create this system for myself now. i predict i'll be using it for the entirety of my professional career. ofc, the way this system feels will radically evolve over time: becoming more natural, as if i have an always on, highly intelligent personal assistant to manage all of my relationships. but the focus will be the same: how can i discover the right people and build strong relationships with them.
### requirements
1. capture
2. enrich
3. organize
4. outreach
5. follow-up
### capture
on any X profile, i want to be able to "collect" it simply: on a press of a key. that profile and the information on the page is saved in my PeopleDB.
over time, this should work on any platform: bluesky, warpcast, etc.
### enrich
AI should research each profile added to the database by studying the person's expression and their other assets (personal sites, essays, videos, etc.), and build a sense of who they are, their interests, etc.
### organize
i should be able to see everyone in the db as rows that i can quickly scroll through, search through, etc.
i should be able to query the database easily: show me great designers and their work, etc.
basically, allow me to find the people i want (who i've already captured), really easily.

separate views for:
- those with active action items.
- filter based on status (to reach out, ongoing, etc.)
### outreach
- help me craft the message to reach out to someone with.
	- there are a few categories of outreach (asks, etc.). i'll need a config file / a way to specify these somewhere that the system uses to craft the message.
- allow me to mark status: to reach out, waiting, ongoing, fail, success, etc.
- allow me to take notes about conversations i've had with them.
- allow me to mark action items.
### follow-up
