possible paths:
- follow natural instinct and **write**: express your ideas / visions in an exceptional way: highly engaging, substance-ful, with a world-class presentation. first, contribute at the level of ideas. amen.
- do NOT stop outreach on the side. this is important to build the list of connections that you can reach out to when you ship something.

---

- run every single day. no matter how you feel. this is your chosen exercise.
- eliminate caffeine - and that overly milky tea nonsense. it isn't worth it.
- min. 4 hours of meditation per day. this is the bare minimum to consider a day a success. it doesn't matter if you do anything else... you MUST do this.
- completely eliminate content consumption. you ain't achieving anything great if you're stuck just consuming crap content. amen.
	- note: this will naturally come the more you meditate - because the meditative, aware, mind is far better at using time well compared to a agitated, dull, mind.
