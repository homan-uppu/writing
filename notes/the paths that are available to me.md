1. **calm the mind** (it's in a fearful state right now) and continue to explore to eventually build your own product and company.
2. **focus** all efforts on a sure shot path to getting back to SF / NYC - through a job.

but, why is going back to SF the goal here? why is that even where you want to be? you'll continue to have the same weak, limited, anxious, fearful, uncollected mind even when you're back there. what's the point even for such an existence.

i'd much rather train my mind to become stronger, and pursue the more ambitious path, but with a twist: an ambitious path that also has a job as a fallback if i need it. that's good.

so yes. there is only one path. double down on it. execute. create something great. amen.
