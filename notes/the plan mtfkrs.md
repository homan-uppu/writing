(NO INTERNET UNTIL YOU HAVE A CRYSTAL CLEAR PLAN IN PLACE) - and you're going to write this write now until you absolutely have to pass out.

continue cold outreach. response rate is v. high. keep at it.

need to build a narrative. what is a narrative? a narrative is a compelling vision for the future that people want (and likely didn't know they wanted until they read it).

without a focused, compelling, big, narrative, this project will be dead before it starts.

an honest (+ extreme) narrative helps with:
- attracting collaborators.
- raising capital.
- getting onboard users: investors in personal tokens, and the talent that wants to raise.

you need a sharp philosophy & vision for life upon which the personal token system acts as a sort of catalyst for the change that you want to see.

with a sharp vision, you need to craft the path.

there is a more powerful, longer-term, compounding approach that i must find here. nothing that doesn't compound won't lead to the results that you're striving for.

### narrative
- start even more fundamentally: what is driving you in this life? what is your core philosophy? how is that driving you to create personal tokens?
- what are personal tokens, and why do we need them?

### product

### penetration (GTM)
- paint a clear picture for how this is going to reach the world. as a story. i need to see it to believe it.
