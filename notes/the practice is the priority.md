nothing else even makes sense to prioritize in life.
the practice truly is everything.
for a week, make the practice the primary focus, and work the second fiddle. and see how it turns out.

my hunch is that everything will benefit: mind, work, relationships, everything.

the mind precedes all. take good care of it my friend.
