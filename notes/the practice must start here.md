i know you have a craving to go to the "mountains" or wherever. but the point is that your practice must start here. if you can't establish the practice in this difficult environment, you can't do it anywhere. and you haven't been able to sufficiently apply the practice here itself.

the thing is, travel does cost money. whether you like it or not. going someplace, the flight tickets, the airport purchases, the taxis, etc. all add up in ways that makes staying here far more economical.

i understand that you should be willing to burn money to accelerate progress. but, burning money just because you can't make a current place work, and when the new place isn't necessarily better, just feels like weakness. amen.

why does it matter if the weather gets hot? sit through it. 
why does it matter if you don't get sunlight within the home? go for walks in the sun / sit in the balcony to soak up the sun.
why does it matter if you don't have anyone to talk to? embrace the solitude to do great work.

train the mind to turn challenging situations in your favor.
you must overcome the challenge in the midst of the challenge, not by escaping to someplace else. train the mind to deal with the situation head on.

lean into running seriously. it's time to go every single day again, and start to hit longer distances. lean into the exercise as a way to ground yourself.

train the mind to execute right fucking here. see it through right here. that's the thought, the intention, you had when you moved into Thatha's. that this is the final frontier in India. that there's nowhere else to go to. see it through.

from a space perspective, the next month-ish looks quite clear. focus, grind, see it through. i'm reasonably confident that i can at least get a solid couple of iterations on the manifesto by then. let's try our best, and see where we land. can make a call then.
