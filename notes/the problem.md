It's not really 2 problems. The gap is definitely a problem, but the bigger problem is that EVEN with the best education, most will not make it.

2. incentives don't exist to produce great outcomes. and average no longer works, meaning most education will fail to produce outcomes necessary to enable people to earn back their investments in education.
3. the business model of education (paying to learn) is no longer valid. the majority of students paying to learn will not be able to pay 

the "solution" so to speak will be a set of incentives that tackles both of these together no?
