Himalayas -> SFO.
no setting up shop anywhere in between. just continue this phase right here for as long as you have to. doesn't matter how long. could even be through the entirety of next year. and the year after. i'm not sure.

30 * 12 = 3.6L / year. if you can stick to this budget, this would be solid.

make due with the slow wifi, no great office furniture, etc. just make do with it. use this God given space (literally "Devbhoomi") to find your natural expression. train the mind to rise above the discomforts. become closer to nature. there is no better option.

hiking is the greatest discovery i've made for myself on this trip. it's life changing. i'm going to always try and live next to a solid hike that i can go on every single day. wow.

after just 2 days of hiking, my body already feels stronger. so much healthier. make this a daily routine. keep pushing.
