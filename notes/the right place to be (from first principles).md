first of all, let me clarify what i'm trying to do during this phase: i want to create according to my natural expression. this is all i want.

i don't know **how long** this phase will last until i get some kind of "break". that is impossible to predict - especially if i stick to my natural expression. it could be tomorrow. it could be a week from now. it could be months. it may even be a couple more years. i'm not sure. i need to be patient, and design my life to enable me to **sustain however long it takes** for the breakthrough.

this means keeping my burn low. there is no better way to play this. give yourself the freedom to take as long as required to do great work. you can't rush this. if you try to rush it, you'll end up doing mediocre work / not shipping anything at all because nothing will reach the bar you want to meet.

the ideal environment keeps your burn low, while giving you the space to explore your natural curiosities and express your natural inclinations without needing to rush it.

the ideal environment for this phase should support: 
- strict OMAD (critically important - this really enhances everything else that i do. massive force multiplier for life).
- deep meditation. daily practice of multiple hours. morning to eve. during every single break. if you remember, it's when you were able to sustain a strong meditation practice, that everything else in life flowed smoothly. meditation is the foundation. nothing else even comes close.
- yogasanas
- running close to nature. i want to build my aerobic base... my heart needs to be made much stronger - it's the weakest it's been my entire life.
- a space for myself. i don't want to share my space with anyone else. i don't want food / beverages at home (besides water). 

if these are met, great work is a natural byproduct. you can't chase great work directly, all you can do is to create the right environment, which supports the right state of mind, which automatically does great work. great work can't be forced directly, it must be cultivated indirectly.

what this means is that i'm already in the perfect environment. all that is lacking is sufficient mastery over my own mind. if you can do this, you can make any place exceptional. you can't just eat more than you should and blame others for doing so. take responsibility and just don't eat!

don't leave when you're in the middle of writing the spec. knock out a great draft, start socializing it, and then make the call (if you do). that's the way to approach this.
