I like it. One day at a time. Doing the same exact thing every day. Eating the same exact thing every day. This is how great work is done. In the mundane monotony lies the most profound achievements.

I'm just going to keep at it. For as long as this takes for a breakthrough. Just keep at it. Could even be years. I'm OK with that because this feels like my natural expression. This is it though. Can't imagine exploring anything else :).
