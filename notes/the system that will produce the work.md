- the foundation is the practice and diet. everything else comes after.
- i'm over-indulging in food. must focus on cutting weight asap. this is the worst my body has been. i need to start taking good care of it. aggressively.

it's also clear to me that i must write this manifesto and focus on building the team first. the right team with the right vision is the starting point. NOT shipping some kind of product and trying to get some users... be patient. it's OK if it takes some time to get the initial team together... but, it's worth it because the right team is a massive force-multiplier: enabling you to do things that would otherwise be impossible.

similarly, the manifesto will be my personal North Star. it will dictate what i do with this life. there is no other way.

i need an environment where i can practice deeply: fasting + meditation. both are required.

just get started here. see how far you can get.
