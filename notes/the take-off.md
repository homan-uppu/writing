it's time to take off. i'm on the cusp.

there is one path that is many orders of magnitudes better than the rest. find it now.

**the best path that i see:**
1. create a stellar spec + presentation for the personal equity token + questions that i must answer in order to able to implement this (most likely from a legal perspective). "implementing" this idea will be expensive due to lawyer fees. will want to raise money to enable this.
2. socialize with friends. get feedback, iterate. 
3. once sufficiently confident in the foundation, reach out to the best people for feedback, to collaborate with, and to raise money from.

---

**pre-reqs:**
1. get solid feedback on the current essay from someone who is a great communicator and understands technology reasonably well. finding this person can take some time, but will be a long-term force multiplier if it's the right person. pay them too. ideally in India somewhere (most likely in BLR). i think it's time to have a sort of "editor" and take the writing process more seriously (and formally).
2. write about (these feel like things that i must think through no matter what. might as well think them through up front no?):
	1. seeking truth
	2. how the 4 year vesting is outdated.
	3. who i want to work with (which is also, the kind of teammate i wish to become).

i think writing about anything other than "personal equity tokens" is a massive distraction. you need to stop identifying with "writer" and follow the idea. the **idea** is bigger than any label you want to identify with. **be a vehicle to the great idea rather than latching onto identities.**

if you need to write an essay that helps build the personal equity token - such as an essay to seek out collaborators or the right company structure, then do so, but don't make writing the core focus - that is severely limiting.

the way to measure your work is how much you've enabled people to discover and follow their natural curiosities. optimize for this. nothing else matters. do everything you can towards this mission. don't restrict yourself to technology. stories, essays, talks, whatever you need to do to make progress in this direction.
