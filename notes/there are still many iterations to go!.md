you're thinking that the draft of the essay is somewhat close to completion. you're sorely mistaken. there's so much more to uncover, flesh out, edit here. there are many iterations left. go through them diligently.

i can't imagine getting through this essay for another week at least! really need to think through what i'm proposing and make sure it actually makes sense. and i need to present it in such a way that it makes sense to any reader.

you're also becoming impatient and distracted. you must lean into the practice much more intensely and deeply. train the mind. train it well.
