calm the tits.
follow your path.
free your mind from cravings for external validation, approval, and status.
focus on what you want to do.
follow your natural curiosity.
this is all you can, and must, do.

every thing you do, do it well.
there is no other way.
be the best at being you.
amen.

this is all you can do.
