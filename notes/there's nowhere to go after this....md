after living here, i don't want to live in an Indian metro with all the pollution and nonsense that it comes with. living close to nature is so valuable. for my health. for my mind. for my heart.

the daily hikes i'm able to go on here have been transformative. sitting on that mound surrounded by majestic Himalayan trees, the freshest air I've ever breathed, and the kindest people I've ever met. i can no longer imagine living in the midst of a bustling city with all the nonsense that comes with hordes of people racing each other.

i can't imagine a good reason to leave in the short-term unless the lack of wifi is absolutely killing my ability to progress. if the Wifi in Netala also sucks, then yeah, i guess i'd have to bounce perhaps... but even then, where would i go to? i want to have a daily hike / run through nature. moving away from nature feels... wrong.

i could just invest in an office right here.
- great desk
- great chair
- internet connection
- keyboard, mouse, and laptop stand.

you're good to go. there's nothing else you need. one meal a day. one long hike a day. meditate as much as required. write.

could manage all of that < 15k - 20k (includes everything) / month.
and i'm pretty sure that if i had the right set up here, i could be incredibly productive, and also become the healthiest and happiest i've ever been bec. the environment nudges me towards the practice in a beautiful way.

getting the table and chair shouldn't be THAT much of an ordeal right? i think it would be. just a much safer bet to double down on Hyd and find a way to be very close to nature, and get the daily nature workouts in. OU may be good enough... not sure. OU is nothing compared to the hikes here from a health perspective. this is insanely healthy. probably the healthiest exercise i've ever done in my life.
