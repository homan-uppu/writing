this phase is open ended and explorative. i will be publishing, but i'm not directly optimizing for a clear business angle just yet. i'm going to be publishing my ideas about the topics that most interest me. i'm giving myself permission to follow my natural curiosity.

i don't know how long this phase will last. it could be a month, or a year. there's a chance it could go longer than that. i'm not sure. but, i would bet that it won't pass 2 years. i feel like i'm going to find an angle quite soon, that i'm going to be executing on. and so the clarity will come soon, but the results may take time to build the momentum i need to achieve escape velocity. yet, all of it could happen in weeks. i'm really not sure.

until i have abundant clarity of the path to execute, i think it would be beneficial to keep burn as low as possible because:
1. i'd like to have the option to spend in a bold, experimental way: 
	1. e.g. a trip to SF for a meeting, etc.
	2. create a stellar intro video for a product / company for 10L (with tailor made music, visuals, etc.).
	3. hire an editor for a couple of months to help me flesh out the ideas in my mind. feedback sessions, proofreading, etc. - now that i think about it, i don't think i'll be doing this. finding the right talent will be ridiculously hard. will just need to get feedback from the world.
2. i don't want my subconscious mind to feel the pressure of dwindling money and then start to focus on angles that generate money in the short-term. this is actually the greatest danger of spending money before you have a clear angle to execute on: the angle itself gets polluted without you realizing. like hiring pre-pmf.

the most annoying sort of burn is the recurring kind. In BLR, you'd easily find yourself spending the $1k / month, and that's not healthy because it really would be like lighting the fuse of a bomb. absolutely.

i see Hyd as the only viable option. It keeps things quite affordable.

if i stay at Thatha's, i can get by under 10k / month. and i'd be happy to spend to get a solid chair to grind out of. this means what i would spend in 8 months in HYD, i'd spend in one month in BLR. if i stay in Mokila, i can get by even cheaper, but that's not the lifestyle that i want. i'd like my own space.
