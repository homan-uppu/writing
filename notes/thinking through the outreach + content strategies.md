think about these together because they go hand in hand. the content you create must attract the people you're trying to connect with (actually, push back on this, i'm not convinced about this).

outreach should be for both sides of the marketplace: investors and the individuals looking to raise capital. there is great value to be gained by engaging with high potential individuals as well.

outreach:
1. **angels, successful founders, early stage VCs** to validate whether they will invest in personal tokens (does the instrument make sense to them, do they have the risk appetite).
2. **young individuals with great potential** to validate whether raising capital by giving up equity in future outcomes makes sense to them, and what terms they'd be willing to do this for.

the purpose of these conversations is:
1. gauge appetite (demand from both sides).
2. ground idea in reality: iterate on the product (details of the contract).
3. build waitlist of users who will transact once the system is created, who i can be in touch with as we build this system.
