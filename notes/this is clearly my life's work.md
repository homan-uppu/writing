in the external world, there isn't time for anything else. this project is the only thing that matters - it is the highest leverage contribution i can make because the success of this project will enable others to create anything that i'd ever want to create. i'm going to help create the system that will create everything else that i could ever want.

there is nothing more worthwhile to work on. absolutely nothing else that i can see.

this project involves excellence in every craft: legal, design, engineering, product, storytelling, filmmaking, politics, everything.

there is absolutely no way to box this into a particular domain / space / craft / region / anything. it is all encompassing. like the human spirit. like my mind.

amplify the incentives, and let Dhamma do its thing. you can't contribute more than along the existing incentives of the world, along the laws of the human condition that already are.

the one project.
the only thing worth creating.
