i can't imagine a better environment to work.
all you need to add is a workout every day. i recommend climbing the mountain, and starting the standing postures at home - after the climb. daily.

there is absolutely no reason to leave this place until you have crystal clear clarity. the thing is: the internet here is actually quite solid. it's not a bottleneck. it's actually beneficial: you can't go on Youtube (internet not good enough), and so you're stuck consuming mostly text when you need to - which is perfect!

i also wouldn't recommend leaving because the burn does not make any sense. it adds unnecessary pressure. i want to save most of the 16L. i'd like to always have 10L in my back pocket for emergencies: medical or otherwise. i don't want to have to go back home (not on my terms) ever again. that's one of the worst feelings.

keep the burn ridiculously low and grind it out. right here. only leave when the internet is actually getting to be a serious impediment. that's when you have the right to leave. till then, stick it out. build a brand around your thinking. write about relevant topics, thoughtfully. connect with other like-minded individuals. practice Jhana. develop mastery over your mind and body. maintain perfect Sila. take it one step at a time. there isn't much else to do.

another great advantage here is that there are absolutely no external distractions! there are no cafes to go to. there are no friends and family asking you to do things with them. there's absolutely nothing here... in the best way possible.
