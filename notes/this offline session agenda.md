todo:
- rough script for [[feeling is AI's final frontier|feeling is AI's final frontier]]
	- leave the parts where you need Claude's feedback blank for now. don't connect the internet for this just yet. that will come in the next session.
- pinned post for X.com that describes the personal token project.
- outreach:
	- clear outreach message that i'm going to send out tonight. (complete the draft to Chris Paik).
	- the "self prompt" for how i'm going to build my list (i.e. who am i going to target, and why).

---

done:
- thoughts on the practice (specifically why the min. sitting duration MUST be 1 hr. you cannot do anything less than that).

---

notes:
- only plug in the internet once you fleshed out all of these details offline.
