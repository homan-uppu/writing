I should consider this wherever I set up shop next.
Have a short coffee table thing as a chair. this enables me to keep changing seating posture by putting legs up. can also keep my back relatively straight. not an issue. quite solid.

honestly, didn't think it would work out this well here tbh. can just focus on the grind and keep at it. amen.
