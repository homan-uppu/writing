i'm going to focus on shipping some writing. this will be my greatest focus, along with a strong meditation practice, and building a solid foundation of Sila.

nothing else matters. stop seeking external validation. seek refuge in the Dhamma.

and also spend some time every day sharpening design chops.

take it small, and slow. this first project is to literally build some internal momentum. to find the joy in building again. that is all. a chance to completely ignore the world and just express yourself. that's all. remember, you can build absolutely anything. find the angle that is worth pursuing and pursue it fully. build the foundation in complete isolation from the world, and then seek critical feedback aggressively.

this is an incredible opportunity to rebuild everything about yourself. to give yourself the space to think deeply about what to bring into the world, and then to actually create it without the distractions and humdrum nonsense of the world (unnecessary conversations, etc.). the mountains are great for serious contemplation - take advantage of it.

i'm in the mood to write about the tokenized individual. do not worry about what comes next. throw all of your plans out of your mind. focus on just the word, sentence, paragraph and essay. that is it.
