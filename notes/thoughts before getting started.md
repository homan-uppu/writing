1. **my craving to travel is reducing**. i just want to stay in one spot and build strong momentum.
2. **keep aiming bigger**. i've realized that my greatest strength is my ability to see wildly ambitious, big, ideas... literally the ability to see. - this is an essay tbh.

i don't feel the need to go anywhere. i can create the best set up for this phase right here, right now.

get the desk. double down on the setup right here, right now. that's it. every rupee needs to reflect in the final products you ship. no spending for a "lifestyle". also consider getting a dedicated business line fast internet - i.e. the kind of things that directly impact moment to moment productivity.

that being said, i really like the idea of my own creative studio. why can't that just be in this room? it totally can. you just have to invest in it.

aim really fucking high. the most universal products that can can deeply impact every being with the human condition. no regionalism, no domain-ism. don't think in "Tech" or "Filmmaking" or whatever other non-ambitious labels society has defined. Follow your natural, most core, expression, which will enable you to do great work.
