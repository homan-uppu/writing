changes i must make:
- **switch to matcha** from here on out. - it has a more balanced "kick" that doesn't spike adrenaline, etc.
- **one meal a day**.
- **double down on yogasanas**. this exercise is the most beneficial thing i've found in my life... especially when done correctly: i.e. slow, reasonably deep, collected breathing and settling the mind into a concentration on the breathing. treating it as a moving meditation.
- **more meditation**. throughout the day build up a serious practice. each moment counts.
- **wake up in the am**. it's not healthy to stay up as late as you're staying up. i generally feel much, much better when i wake up sometime early morning (5 - 8am).

all of this being said, being rigid on schedule isn't necessarily a good thing. when inspiration strikes, i'm going to chase it even if it means that i'm up all night. that's just the nature of great work - it doesn't adhere to *your* expectations.
