**give it a budget of 3.33L**. - try to actually hit the budget - challenge yourself to show a multi-crore production value with 3.33L.

the primary investment will be in the equipment that is required to capture high quality video and audio, and the software required to produce the output that i want. minimize the money spent on peoples' time - maximize the impact of each rupee on the final product.

capital towards equipment:
- top of the line camera, lens, and audio capture system.
	- i want a lens that gives me the 90's cinema grain.
- whatever software add-ons i need to get the effects that i want (e.g. the 90's film grain, etc.)

capital towards human time:
1. cinematographer + lighting (ideally the same person).
2. sound
3. background score - ideally just buy one that has been made, there's no need to get one made from scratch. but, still, explore what that could look like (e.g. go through Asrith / friends of his for this).
4. coaching for dialogue delivery - get someone who coaches actual actors and is well known for training excellent dialogue delivery. i want this training from someone who is one of the best.
5. get feedback from a mass cinema / punch dialogue / writer to see if there are ways to amp up the elevation in the video.

the moment you have the script ready, get in touch with every single person you know in Hyd who can help you implement this idea. set up meetings. fly into Hyderabad and efficiently knock out the video in a matter of 2 weeks. use the experience making the first video to create momentum for future videos (which you should be publishing at least once a month).

this is it. this is the kind of expression that is your strength. make it fucking count.

write the script with a new, excellent fountain pen. write the script in one sitting - morning to evening i want a draft complete. challenge yourself in this way. it's ok if the draft sucks and you need to iterate on it / change it / even trash the entire thing. but i MUST be able to knock out an entire draft in a day. that is the power that i must cultivate.
