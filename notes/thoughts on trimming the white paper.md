this is absolutely required.
take advantage of the catch-all "appendix" chapter, and throw everything that isn't absolutely necessary into it.

no one's got the time to read 6k words. i doubt most would even want to read 3k... but there is a minimum that i likely can't go below if i'm to be able to describe the system with sufficient nuance.

go through this trim. kill your darlings. kill the attachment you have for certain sections, chapters, lines, etc. edit with calm, dispassionate mind.
