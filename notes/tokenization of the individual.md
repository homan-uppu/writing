what do i need to understand well, in order to explain this?

1. **all we want is economic growth**. (big picture set of incentives that dictates human activity).
2. **inequality of outcomes is a byproduct of innovation.**
3. **what will replace our education system?** / how the education bubble will burst.
	1. walk through what the education standard is today, and how that entire stack is about to be replaced by something fundamentally better (through better incentives).
4. **on tokenization of the individual** - this is more about the implementation details of the system that will replace our education system.

this is the series that is most appealing to me. this is what i want to explore.
do you have the courage to do so?
