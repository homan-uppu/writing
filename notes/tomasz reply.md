Homan,

Interesting concept. The idea of democratizing opportunity resonates, particularly given the shifts weâ€™re seeing with AI.

Honestly, my initial reaction is that established mechanisms like fellowships, scholarships, and direct educational support feel like a more proven path to achieving similar outcomes.

I wonder if young people really understand exactly what it is that they're doing when they sell tokens like this, but I could be totally wrong.

Best,

Hey Tomasz, thanks for the reply. Fair reaction.

The problem with existing approaches ("established mechanisms like fellowships, scholarships, and direct educational support") is: they are short in supply. Many individuals with great potential are frequently passed up. Personal tokens creates a market with more investors (because there are returns) that will serve many, many, more individuals.

Even individuals who do have access to established paths would want to sell equity in their personal tokens to:
1. signal competence. Having the right "shareholders" in your personal token is a more powerful signal of competence than a degree from an institution or even scholarships, etc. (e.g. if Sam Altman is a shareholder in the personal token of a young, bright, AI researcher, many doors would open for them).
2. give great mentors some equity to further incentivize them to help them win. There isn't a more powerful incentive than equity.

Great point about whether young people will understand what they're entering into. I admit there's a massive educational component (among other required guardrails such as capping how much equity you can sell, ability to buy back, etc.).
