if you're going to travel, go someplace where you can deepen the practice, not some hustle bustle city (e.g. NYC / BKK / TYO).

the big cities will simply distract you by overwhelming your senses. they aren't conducive to the practice.

it also doesn't make sense to randomly socialize. if i'm going to socialize, it's with people who have honed the craft of life. those are the people that i'd want to spend time with. aside from spending time with them, what's the point of socialization?

therefore, it really doesn't make sense to travel.

besides, your practice is going strong right here.
the Puja room is a fantastic battleground to straighten the mind, to tame it, to conquer my self.

you need nothing else.

this sort of solitude and routine is how the greatest transformations happen.
give yourself this opportunity for transformation.

i want a single move: to SF. nothing else makes sense. and you ought to go earlier than you think.
