write it all out. don't worry about the length, or the repurcussions. the goal here is to lay out the mission with crystal clarity, with a clear idea for how to execute the mission.

this material will be used to attract great teammates who believe in this vision. and to raise capital to fuel our journey.

i'm telling you... this almost philosophical exploration is critical to lay the right foundation.

go hard. get the first draft out faster than you think you should. this is the only way to operate.
