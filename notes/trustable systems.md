Trustable systems are:

**1. Reliable**. The system does what it says. If it says action A will produce outcome B, then any time a user does action A, they will see outcome B.

**2. Predictable**. The system evolves according to clear principles and incentives. Someone who understands these underlying incentives can accurately reason about the system's future state and behavior.

**3. Honest**. Facts provided by the system are true (aligned with reality).
