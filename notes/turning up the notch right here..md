no more going downstairs and socializing.
going to create a bubble for me right here in this space.
not leaving until i achieve escape velocity.
i have everything i need right here.
go buy a good chair - going to be spending the majority of the day in this chair, might as well have a good one.

traveling is just going to slow you down.
no place is better than right now.
i don't want to introduce unnecessary turbulence: having to get set up in a new place, new environment, etc.

just stay put until you have a solid whitepaper. socialize it, and then based on the pull you receive, make a call.
