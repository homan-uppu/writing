Adverse selection on the supply side, in the context of your personal token concept, suggests that the individuals most eager to sell equity in their future might be those who privately know they're less likely to succeed. This is a classic asymmetric information problem:
- Those with high confidence in their future earning potential might prefer traditional funding routes (loans they'll easily repay, traditional VC once they're ready, etc.)
- Those with lower confidence might be more eager to sell equity in their uncertain futures
Your potential investor is concerned that your platform might attract primarily the latter group, creating a market filled with lower-quality "investments."

Great point.

To clarify how I interpreted "adverse selection on the supply side": the best talent would have access to traditional paths: loans, scholarships, grants, and traditional VC (once they're ready), etc. and only "lesser talent" would be willing to sell equity in future outcomes. If such an adverse selection were to happen, personal tokens will fail because if the best don't use personal tokens, then there won't be enough value generated by the rest to be sustainable (due to the extreme power law distribution of outcomes). Let me know if this is incorrect / missing something.

I don't believe such an adverse selection will happen in the long-run because:

1. Having the right "shareholders" in your personal token will be a powerful signal of competence similar to having the right investors in your company. Ex: many doors will open for a bright young individual with Tyler Cowen as a shareholder in their personal token in the same way that potential customers will agree to sales meetings with AI companies simply because Sam Altman is an investor. 
2. Even when someone has other ways to finance their learning, they would still want great people to invest in their personal token to incentivize a sort of mentorship that wouldn't be possible without giving up equity in upside (similar to how already rich founders still get investors for new companies to bring more people on the journey). 
3. Raising capital through personal tokens will also be the best way to finance an ambitious, capital intensive, exploration (e.g. Charles Darwin's voyage). such an individual requires more capital than most available grants. Their research is too "weird" to be funded by an institution, or by a handful of grant givers. And it's too early to formally structure their exploration as a company. While it may seem the number people this applies to is laughably small, I predict we will see much more of this sort of explorations if there was market for it. As AI becomes more powerful, it amplifies the individual. Enabling even a handful of valuable, ambitious, explorations that would otherwise not be funded could change the world bec. each of them will go much, much further than before.

Thoughts?

(p.s. I'm super grateful for your reply. Your work has helped shape what I do with my life - as you can prob tell by now).

- i fear many Charles Darwins of today who don't come from wealth 

- similar to how though many might view YC's deal (7% equity) isn't a good one for founders, but it still has positive signal because of the exclusivity of the program itself. we would see similar signal for selective, exclusive mentors who train people in their craft in exchange for equity in personal tokens - which would be seen as a positive signal ("XYZ took a big bet on me").
