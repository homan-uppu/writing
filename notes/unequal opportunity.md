can see this anywhere you look... especially in India. perhaps start the day writing about this. this is a good way to re-energize your motivation. when your motivation is grounded in a craving for your own status and wealth, you can't execute well. be motivated by the change that you want to see.

3 types of opportunity:
1. capital
2. cultural
3. defaults
### wealth
- straight up capital. those with access to wealth, regardless of where they are born have a significant advantage.
### cultural
- what people prioritize.
	- storytime: my own family: prioritizing education above everything else, to the extent that they are willing to sell all they have in order to provide the best education to their children... from moving, to selling assets, taking loans, whatever. this leads to a long-term, multi-generational, advantage because knowledge is the most important asset that will sooner or later translate to anything else.
	- as this advantage becomes more pronounced, it begins to look unfair from the outside while ignoring the sacrifices that the prioritization required.
### defaults
- the language you think in, how restrictive your government is, the laws you have to abide by, how meritocratic your system is. these are things that no individual directly controls, but your (mis)fortune of birth determines these.

what would we need to do to democratize opportunity?
1. wealth: personal tokens.
2. cultural.
3. good defaults?

- unequal access to opportunity. - write a quick essay about this.
	- and also how there's a **difference between** access to culture and access to resources. culture influences how you utilize your resources, whereas resources = capital, assets, etc.
	- advantages of being born in a "winning" culture: your defaults are just so much better than the defaults of people born elsewhere:
		- thinking in the right language is such a winning default: you have access to many orders of magnitudes greater market.
