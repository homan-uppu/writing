1. **those that don't give me feedback within a month of receiving my request** (and i know they read it), i will **never** share any ideas that i'm working on before i publish them (and they can read them once i publish them). nothing against these people, but our judgements are too far mis-aligned about great ideas, that i'm just not going to waste time sharing things with them.
2. **then, rank based on quality of feedback**. 

having no status is such a boon. if you had status and successes under your belt, many will respond quickly with great feedback because their priors are much higher due to the status i have.

when someone responds positively to this idea, and i have no status, it means that they truly have a judgement that is quite aligned with mine.

i suspect the ones that i will work very closely with throughout my life will be individuals who i connect with *before* i achieve status and wealth. amen.
