- render all visualizations through code. this is strictly superior. keeps everything in sync more easily. allows for powerful animations.

render using the actual models:
- PersonalToken
- CompanyToken -> (yes, better than calling it Company)

and use this to render the actual personal token.

keep most of the fields of personal token optional so that the child personal tokens don't have to be fully filled out to be rendered properly.

great.
