3. **power law related**
	- Chess vs. Go. (comparative power law). - with a table of top players, and a line for the median ELO - would be good to have a database for this.

4. **general UX related:**
	1. Investing in individuals animation.
	2. Portfolio of personal tokens.

5. **excellent hero image - consider using one of the above, or creating a minimal "icon" for the essay.**

great. just 4 stellar assets, and call it. they should all be stylistically on brand. take the time to define this brand style, will be using this moving forward. as you design the assets, see if it makes more sense to have them as animation, or static image. not yet decided on this. static image makes it more exportable and sharable, but the animations are beautiful, AND lighter bec. the reader's browser draws it.

I can see these assets being completed by e.o.d. amen. puts me in a good position to grind hard on the prose from tomorrow onwards, for however long it takes.
