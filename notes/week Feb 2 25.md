each moment counts.
daily routine is rigid and fixed: wake up at 4:15am daily. shower, and get to the 90 minute sit. i don't care if you fall asleep during the sit, but you must sit upright (Dhutanga). you must develop mastery over the mind and tackle uncomfortable situations head on. cultivate comfort in discomfort.
