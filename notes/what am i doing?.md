reasoning:

i'm sitting on an idea: personal tokens, and i'm figuring out the best way to bring this idea to the world. 

i believe this idea has the power to change the world for the better. i can't see any other way that the world evolves than to adopt personal tokens.

what path are you taking to bring this tool to the world?
1. Communicate my ideas to the world so that i can get feedback and ground these ideas in reality. I believe this is a critical step. why is this a critical step?

on location:
- i want to minimize socialization & maximize nature. i def don't want to be in BLR - it's mediocristan. i'm hesitant to travel to the mountains - because i sense that most people there aren't serious about anything. full of mundane concerns. which is also the case here, but if it's also the case there, then why move is my thought. but damn, the weather does make a difference! you could consider it for that purpose alone.
