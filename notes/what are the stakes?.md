- students burdened with debt they will not be able to repay, who will painfully realize that most of their education was not only worthless, but wasted precious time that they could have utilized well if they had known what was actually going on.

- most students will not be able to repay their education loans. as they scramble to figure out how to make a living.
- the problem isn't just that there will be a loss of jobs in the short-run - because this is actually not necessarily true. each technological leap enables a lot more jobs than it takes away. the problem is that getting good enough at the jobs that it enables is significantly more difficult - likely by orders of magnitude.
- when difficulty increases to such a high level, two things happen:
	- obviously someone who is already working and laid off will find it very difficult to make the jump (old dog new trick etc.)
	- for anyone training for the new skills, the outcomes will be far more extreme.
