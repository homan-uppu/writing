**Decided: Hyderabad it is**. - when it's time to move, it's also way faster (just drop things off at home, and bounce). and there's just access to other talent that i may want to make use of.
- 1 gbps internet. - 2k / month
- monitor, desk, great chair setup.
	- buy new mouse and new chair.

think this through from scratch. i want to think this through now because i don't want this sort of nomadic / wandering lifestyle. i want to have the infrastructure to grind. and i want it for the long-term (i.e. many months), so that i give myself the time i need to do great work. explore all options and decide the plan of action.
## what is execution during this phase?
- **it's not time constrained**. i don't know when critical momentum could be achieved. it could be 2 months. it could be 2 years. i can't let it flow longer than 2 years, so i'm going to take that as a hard limit.
- **follow natural curiosity.** i have no constraints on what i'm going to create. i'm starting with writing, but there are many directions in which this can morph. i am open to anything. my heart is saying lay the foundation first, and then build a world-class team. so that is where my intuition is pulling at the moment.
- **ship often.**. i'm either shipping ideas, content, or products. on a regular basis. no matter what, i will have proof of work.
- **introspection. sila, samadhi, panna.**. the practice is the foundation. will spend a lot of time training the mind.
## budget?
out of the money i have, i need to **put aside 10L for emergencies**. i can't take that lightly anymore. be responsible. this means i have 8L for this phase. that is roughly 10k usd... far more than enough.

ok, so i have to make 8L last for 2 years. that gives me a budget o 4L / year. that gives me 33k / month burn (MAX). which means burn ought to be <= 15k (half of it) so that i give myself some buffer here. that buffer is necessary. i know i will tap into it for random, misc stuff, especially if it concerns improving productivity.

**max burn: 20k / month - which needs to include EVERYTHING.**

2k - internet
10k - rent. max.
5k - food.
3k - misc?

and this set up must NOT negatively impact productivity at all. so, need to think through what impacts my productivity and what doesn't.
## what i want to maximize productivity.

infra:
- fast interent.
- reasonable desk & chair.
- laptop raiser (to keep my neck in a healthy position)
- keyboard and mouse.

environment:
- **deep isolation**. no conversations that pull me away from my work. i'm going to be heads down without any room for distractions. i don't want to be near people that i know. i need deep isolation. the world should feel that i am dead to it. that is the level i want to retreat from the world. when i am back, i will come back at a very different level. until then i'm in retreat mode. 
	- i don't want to have to answer any question about what i'm working on, why, what i'm doing with my life, etc. 
	- i don't want to feel obligated to go to any event: weddings, house warmings, etc.
	- i don't want relatives / people to be able to pop in at any time and pull me out of the zone.
	- i don't want conversations and people to remind me who i was. i'm trying to focus on the present so that i can shape who i become.
	- this isn't how i will want it all the time. but for this phase, such isolation feels necessary. at least, that's what my intuition is telling me.
- **clean air. ventilation**. my lungs and body should benefit from each breath i take, not be harmed.

food:
- one healthy meal a day that has all the nutrients i need. ideally someone else can cook this for me.

chores:
- clothes and cleaning i can do, not an issue. would be happy to pay for house help to do more deep cleaning every now and then. - this is actually the most adjustable.
## options
- Hyderabad: 
	- home. - nope.
	- **Thatha's**. -  nope. (too many people that i know are in the vicinity. doesn't work to achieve the solitude that i want).
	- **rent a space**. this could be ideal. away from most folks. this can be solid. for some reason, i really don't want to be in Hyd. Yet, it's the city with the best infrastructure, and a city that you are familiar with.
- Banglore:
	- rent a nice place in HSR layout. if BLR, there is absolutely no other place than HSR layout - that place is absolutely perfect.
- Uttarkashi / Netala / Siror
	- invest in some infrastructure: good table, chair, and internet, and grind away without leaving. this place meets all of the other requirements that you have.
	- but i doubt the internet quality will work here. it's just not going to be fast. it will always be some sort of a drag i feel. guess i'll have to test it out? i'm not sure about this. this will be the bottleneck. - but, you won't really know till you try?

ok, all of this thinking makes sense. but it doesn't show me a clear answer. fascinating. i don't really want to make a move to BLR. It feels like too much of a hassle, and I'm not confident I'd get my money's worth. If I'm looking for isolation, i don't really need the social scene at all. just having my own apartment in the middle of nowhere, with fast internet, is really all i need. Spending an extra 30 / 40k just to be close to a Yoga shala also feels quite stupid. Just need to focus on executing.

that being said, would be good to have access to an organic store, etc. but, tbh, the food grown here in Netala / Siror is bound to be high quality. i can't imagine it not being so, because it's literally grown right here. ofc, i don't know the kind of pesticides, etc. they use, and i'm not keen to find out lol.

so yeah, you're back at square one. don't worry about this until you achieve what you have in [[PHASE GOALS]]. when internet becomes a serious bottleneck, then can consider what can be done. and consider just doubling down here. Every thought you're having about leaving are just excuses. you don't need the internet right now for the work that you're doing. what you have more than suffices. you need to focus on writing. focus on laying the thinking foundation. focus on publishing essays to the world.

this environment is perfect for these goals. if you really need internet to be able to implement some of your ideas, THEN you can do some research to see what is possible in this area from an internet perspective. you may need to move to Netala / Uttarkashi, but that's not that big of a deal. But, even if you do get internet, it's not going to be faster than 100mbps fyi. keep that in mind. that should suffice for what you're trying to do. but it never will be. if you ever want to cut a video, or do something else, the internet will always slow you down. it's better to move once you're sure you need the internet, and until then, just make do with the data that you have. this is the way to go.

no more thinking about this until you've knocked out phase goals. amen. let's get back to work.
