- develop your core idea. build the foundation upon which you will express. do it from nature. if not here, then some other cabin place nearby. this weather and this environment is conducive to doing exceptional work.
- strong meditation practice.
- daily exercise. just get to the road and run? or perhaps you can do some hikes in the interiors to avoid any vehicles.
- move to one meal a day. it's time.

take it one day at a time. if it starts to work, commit to larger chunks of time. amen.
