what if you say: you can't move. you must achieve escape velocity from right here. what would you do? what if you didn't have a cent on you. how would you operate? what if you were forced? would you crumble? what would you do?

ship the essay from here. grow it from here. lean into your practice to keep you sane.

this is stupid stubbornness. you should move if it accelerates progress. theres should be no other criteria in your mind. keep moving around. be a wanderer as that's probably the right lifestyle for you. do what feels right. amen.
