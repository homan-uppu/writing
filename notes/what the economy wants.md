In an extreme economy who's outcomes follow the power law distribution, you must be one of the best at what you do. There is no room for the average. Excellence in what you do is no longer a nice-to-have but a necessity.

"Excellence", "average" are relative terms. If suddenly everyone become what is now considered excellent, then that becomes average. So these are essentially moving targets that are dictated by everyone else in the world.
(more examples of this bar shifting).

There are two levers that individuals can pull to find their way towards being able to create value:
1. Differentiation: offer something that few others can.
2. Excellence: be one of the best at what you offer.

The more similar you are to others, the stiffer the competition you face, and the more difficult it is to be one of the best. You can escape such competition through differentiation. But, no matter how much you can differentiate, you will likely still come across competition - proportional to how lucrative that skill is - and you will have to strive for excellence in that thing.

Some may look at this and feel that this is how the economy has always worked. And they would be somewhat right: these are the dynamics you'll find at the pinnacle of any field: arts, entrepreneurship, academics, etc. But, what makes this such a massive paradigm shift today is that it applies to *everyone*, not just the elites in any domain.

But isn't the world a positive-sum game, meaning there should be room for everyone to create value without competition - each offering something so unique that no one else can? In theory, this may be possible. This is sort of the North Star - the final state of the economy that we work towards, but in reality this will be very difficult to achieve simply because it's not easy for someone to discover their unique capabilities. It takes time and many will never do so before they die, and will find themselves competing. Similarly, an individual's uniqueness may not be valued by the world (e.g. someone who's innately fascinated by studying poisonous mushrooms) and they will find it difficult to create enough value, and will be forced to compete on a more lucrative skill. It will be difficult to completely avoid competition.
