specifically around women.
i have a strong desire right now to flirt with women, go on dates, be intimate, and satisfy them in bed.

this is precisely the craving you must keep at bay.
this isn't the right time for this kind of expression.
keep the mind more balanced.
lean into the yogasana + meditation practices and build a foundation of deeper inner peace and stability.

there are different flavors of "feeling good". the peace kind of feel good is powerful: you have much greater control over the mind and can more easily ignore distractions. then there's the "high" sort of feeling good that can be quite distractive.
