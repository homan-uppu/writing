My intuition says I do need to point out the challenges.
How about this: write whatever comes to your mind with the intention of finding an exit as soon as possible. Try to propose paths rather than actual tangible solutions at this stage, and see what comes of it.

If I were to break down the implementation in another essay, how would I structure this  "series"?
1. Why venture capital will eat education
2. How venture capital will eat education (or something like this could be used to dig into the implementation details).

Yeah, this will have to happen tomorrow. Going to rest the mind.
