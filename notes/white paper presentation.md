1. **beautiful**. visual. people should clearly understand the concepts, should flow well, and easy to navigate to different parts of the white paper. spend extra time on making the visuals exceptional (minimal, yet adding tremendous value).
2. **extracting the right feedback**
	1. with a strong incentive to give feedback.
	2. is the feedback just for me, or will it be visible to all?

need to study how feedback for other, similar, projects were... hmm...
