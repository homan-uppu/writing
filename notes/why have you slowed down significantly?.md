i just hate this bitch work. that's the honest truth. i hate having to draw these graphs and other nonsense. i just want to focus on the idea lol.

fucking deal with it. the implementation is just as important as the idea. it's the vehicle for the idea to reach the world.

deal with it. make it happen.

go meditate. bring your mind back to it.
