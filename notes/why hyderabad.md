pros:
- **logistical convenience**: can always dump things at Amma's place when you need to move to SF. any moves are super easy.
- **productivity infrastructure is world class**
- can literally create the absolute ideal environment.

cons:
- no one to meet in person. e.g. if i get an editor to help w/ the writing, i most likely won't be meeting them in person.
- culture of the city is hedonistic and weak. no ambition. most are fine doing mediocre work.
	- but, look, you're going to create your own sanctuary. there's no need to worry about external stuff.
