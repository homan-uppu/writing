your vision for the future is still vague. communicating ideas clarifies them. communicating ideas and sharing them gives the world the chance to show you where you're wrong - enabling you to more effectively seek truth.

this is not a question of quantity. one, well crafted, high quality piece of communication can work wonders. it's OK if that piece takes a long time to write. it's OK. accept that it's part of the process. whatever you do, do NOT cut corners. whatever you produce must be of exceptional quality.

the idea i want to communicate:
1. education in a post-AGI world. (talking about the entire system of learning itself.)

that's it. do this one topic exceptionally well. go deep. really deep. perceive the future. and publish it.
