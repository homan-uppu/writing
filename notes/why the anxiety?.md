this anxiety is hidden in the subconscious. it raises its head whenever it fucking feels like it and overpowers your mind. it's time to reclaim the mind, to fortify it against the enemies that pull you away from your natural expression.

this is the **most important training of them all**. nothing else matters in front of this. make the meditation the top priority. earn your freedom. nothing else matters.
