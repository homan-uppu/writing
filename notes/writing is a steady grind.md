While some people may imagine the life of a writer as balancing long stretches of idleness with flash in pan inspiration moments, the reality is that writing, and creativity, is more of a steady grind. Murakami says, “I have to pound away at a rock with a chisel and dig out a deep hole before I can locate the source of my creativity” — a sentiment which reflects his structured routine and lifestyle.

I don't see a way around this.
