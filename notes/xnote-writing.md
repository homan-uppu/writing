1. Create a Firebase project.
2. Set up Vercel project for this. Set up vercel locally for the repo. (to use api keys locally).
3. Wire up Firestore to the app.
4. client firestore api - fetch all docs, update title, lastEdited.
5. Get a basic editor set up that persists.
6. Hyper focus feature.
7. Local persistence.
8. Start using it to write. Make it your driver.

I actually think it will be healthy to use that.
Gives me a playground to try things out.
That's useful.
It keeps that part of my brain active. That's a good thing (I think). Anyways, we'll see.

Tomorrow I'm going to spend the day building the writing app. Wiring it all up and preparing it to be my daily driver.

And then I'm going to get to writing. No matter how shitty I feel about it. Just gonna keep writing. Amen.

I don't care anymore. Going to keep writing no matter fucking what.
Shape my body. Train my mind. Write.

This is it. I don't care what comes from it. I'm going to be very stubborn about this. Amen. Let's get it mofo!
