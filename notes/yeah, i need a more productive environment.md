i just want to grind hard.
and i feel incredibly stuck right now.
but i have a feeling the "stuck"-ness isn't due to the environment.
the "stuck" is a mental habit that i have to break through.
make it happen.

i might be down to take a leap of faith. but... need some more clarity first.
yeah, no "leaping" without the work that enables the leap.
