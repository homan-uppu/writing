i want a consistent place that i can use as "home base". even if i travel to other places for weeks / months at a time, a place that i can still come back to and grind. a place that stays somewhat consistent. a creative studio.

i can make that studio here in Netala. i do believe that is possible - can rent a small room in Netala, set up internet, and buy a great desk + chair, and go HAM. that is possible.

Living here gives me access to incredible nature.

what about the cold? i could just buy more layers and also a heater no? that should be more than sufficient imo. this isn't crazy weather, it's basically SF weather. you can deal with this quite well.

**what is an alternative?**
- DD colony, Hyderabad. a small flat. exceptional internet (1gbps), desk, monitor, chair. perfect weather (and in the summer can just use air conditioning).
- i'd prefer to rent a flat rather than stay at Thatha's? i'm not sure. or, can just double down in Mokile - naaah.
- highrise in Gachibowli, etc.

as much as the physical infrastructure of the alternative is appealing, i don't think it can match the nature infrastructure here - which positively impacts my work more than any material infrastructure can (during this phase at least).
