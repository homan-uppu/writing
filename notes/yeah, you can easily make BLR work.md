just bathe with the water cans. that's it. it's that simple.

but, mind you, this does add significant operational overhead.

there is groceries, cooking, laundry, cleaning, water can replacing, etc. would make sense to hire someone for these tasks... including cooking.

but yeah, if you do figure all of this out, you can make it reasonably affordable:
- 40k rent.
- 5k cook
- 10k groceries / food.
- 5k maid.
- 5k water cans.
- 3k internet
- 3k yoga classes
- 9k misc.

-> you can hit the target if you don't eat out much and stick to a disciplined routine at home.

40k rent is required to get a good, inspiring space that you can gladly work out of. doesn't make sense to skimp on this.

Netala will give stiff competition though.
you can achieve the same health here at:
- 3k internet
- 6k rent
- 7k groceries / food
- 3k chef (can literally pay someone like Jasveer / Kapil to swing by and cook something great once a day).

-> everything you could want < 20k / month. with the same fast internet, and an opportunity to practice Ashtanga - though you'll have to do it on your own. long meditation sessions by the river. long hikes up the mountain post lunch. this place has it all. just need to buy some heavy duty winter clothes and a heater to warm things up. that's all you need.

you only think about cost when you don't have a clear idea and traction. when you have clarity, you will naturally just move to wherever you are most productive in. therefore, first focus on the idea and traction. and then we'll figure this out. amen.
