it's pretty incredible the impact this has.
i found that it only really works if you don't over-exert. you should not feel winded at the end of it. you should be able to go for an hour at least. i'm currently hitting 54 mins of running. need 5 more mins ish, so that's basically one more lap (8 laps).

8k at 7m per km = 56 mins + to and fro = an hour.
this is a good starting point. once the time improves (without increasing strain), will increase mileage.

must run in a way that doesn't "wear" me down. and must keep up yogasanas, etc. to aid with recovery.

must at least intermittent fast. this is important.
