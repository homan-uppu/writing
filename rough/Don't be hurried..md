Hurriedness hurts your ability to seek truth.
The mind must be extremely patient, balanced, persistent.
Else, you will fall into the traps you've been falling into your entire life: chasing after status, prestige, wealth, etc.

Don't be hurried. Give the work an open-ended timeline. It'll get done when it gets done.
