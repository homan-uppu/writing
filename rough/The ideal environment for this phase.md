*when to execute and set this up? After you've achieved sufficient momentum such that you KNOW what needs to be done, and the roadmap is clear. Prematurely executing is a problem because there's a possibility you can skip this step and go straight to SF. If that is a possibility sooner rather than later, then the effort to move to BLR / HYD will just be wasted time and effort (I'd lose at least 3 days setting everything up). Be patient. When the time is right, you'll know it.*

**Duration**:
- The more I lean into this process, the **longer** I think it will take. And, I'm perfectly OK with that. I'm not going to back out of this process again because I know that without this phase of deep introspection and thinking, I won't be able to stick to anything. I will never again do shallow work. I don't care if I die without accomplishing anything worthwhile because I simply can't see any other way.
- I want to design a space that will work for at least one year. 12 entire months for me to develop sufficient mastery over my mind (most important goal), while building momentum in my work.

**Location**:
- Secluded. Away from the hustle and bustle of a bustling metro. Or if within a metro, in an area that doesn't feel like it.
- Minimal to no commute for anything that I may need. Absolutely no need to drive.
- Well connected to infrastructure. 
	- Organic, high quality food. 
	- Blazing fast internet (1gbps).
	- Swiggy / Zepto / etc. 
	- Medical: dentist, diagnostics, docs, etc. close by.
	- Amazon fast delivery.
- Ideally: close to an Ashtanga studio because it's easier for me to establish my practice in that setting.

**Space**:
- A 1bhk with a reasonable sized living area / a 2bhk, so that there is a dedicated area for work that is separate from where I sleep.
- Good greenery in surroundings, away from main road, so that air quality is healthy.
- A dedicated small room / space for meditation. In Indian home layouts, this would be the "Puja room".
- Work area:
	- window opening towards a quiet street and greenery.
	- solid, sturdy desk, excellent chair.
	- UPS to keep the internet on during blackouts, and one charging port for electronics.
	- 
- A personal library of books that I spend some time each day reading (after my creative work sessions are done).
- Kitchen:
	- a mini fridge to keep things for a couple of days (milk / veggies).
	- infrastructure to cook one solid meal per day.
- house help: daily clean, laundry. i want to cook on my own because this is a habit i want to cultivate. helpful no matter where in the world i go to.

**Finances**:
- Monthly: 40k rent. 20k food. 20k misc (internet, yoga, etc.). Should top off at 80k / month. $1k / month burn. without this sort of financial commitment, the space will be suboptimal in some key ways. i would say that it'd be totally worth it.
