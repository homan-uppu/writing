The environment has a great impact on the mind.
When the environment moves slowly, it gives the mind the opportunity to settle down, to relax, to find its inner calm.

I can't imagine having to grind in the middle of BLR / HYD - with all sorts of sounds, chaos, pollution, etc. I guess all parts of the metros aren't like that. HSR layout has its quiet and beautiful parts as well, undeniably.

But still. Embrace how great this opportunity is. There's a lot of good work that I can do from right here!
