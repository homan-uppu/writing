Can you accurately describe a feeling using words?

i don't think you can. not even if you had ten thousand years to write it out.

this is because the representational complexity of a feeling is too large for formal language to capture. it's like trying to describe a 3 dimensional shape using only 2 dimensions. you can never quite "get there".

for example, when you compare two instances of joy, they're never exactly the same even though we might use the same word to describe them. or when two people say that they're both angry, there's a lot of difference between their angers.
- todo: start to introduce other "types" of feeling like intuition & taste: e.g two go players who read the same book will still have different feelings about what the right move is in a given situation.

feelings don't rely on reason. intuition and taste are feelings. and because you can't fully describe a feeling in formal language, you can't directly teach intuition and taste.

you can't directly teach someone to have good taste in which questions to ask, or which paths to take in a complex world.

and therefore, i predict that as AI gets better, the only kinds of work that remains will be ones based on feeling: the ones based on

Einstein's intuition for what questions to ask and give importance to stems from feeling. Steve Job's intuition for how to market Apple so that it makes people feel powerful stems from feeling, not logic.
