- Every desire we have, every ideology / religion that is invented, every great art that we create, all work towards economic growth.
	- Would Gutenberg have invented the printing press without his strong desire to spread Christianity to the world? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg
		- The printing press wasn't just a commercial invention, but a potential instrument of spiritual and social transformation.
- Would we have ended slavery if doing so didn't result in long-term economic growth?
- Economic growth also incentivizes the ideologies and arts that further amplify the growth.
	- E.g. how our circle of morality grows larger as we become more prosperous (e.g less wanting to kill other animals, and treat every being more fairly).
- Economic growth has helped prevent large scale wars (the incentives don't exist anymore).
- Religion:
	- Buddhism has devolved from liberating the mind to sufficiently calming the mind so that you can be more productive and contribute towards economic growth.
		- very interesting reference: how the Buddhists predicted that there would be no traces left of the actual practice in a certain number of centuries because the system will be too powerful to go against.
- The greatest act of rebellion isn't raging against the system. It's opting out. And the more powerful technology becomes, the more impossible it becomes to opt out.

This is more of why I believe in acceleration. There is nothing more worthwhile to do.
