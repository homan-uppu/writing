Quality of users in the Network is the most important thing to get right.

High quality users are ambitious, honest, earnest.

Of these attributes, ambition is the most important because an ambitious person is forced to be sufficiently honest and earnest. An ambitious person thinks long-term: they’re optimizing for doing great work over the course of their lives, and will therefore understand the importance of building and preserving a strong reputation. Tarnishing their reputation will prevent them from building relationships with other ambitious individuals and from valuable resources (capital and otherwise) that they’ll need to fulfill their ambitions.

How can you identify ambition? It seems to be more art than science. I don’t think there’s any clear criteria such as: admission into a prestigious institution, a good score on some standardized test, or number of followers, etc. that can help determine whether someone is sufficiently ambitious to be a good addition to the Network.

There will many takes and intuitions about how to gauge someone's ambition. Therefore, instead of being biased towards a certain way of filtering applicants, the Network should be more lenient about who it lets in, and let the investors (with their unique approaches to determining the quality of candidates) take on the burden of gauging the quality of a user they want to invest in (or whatever traits they believe make it worth investing in someone).

1. Identify applicant.
2. Require everyone to submit a short bio / essay for what they want to do, who they are, what they’ve done so far.
3. Perform a background check and reject applicants who have a clear history of fraud.

i want to be clear, honest + earnest does not mean not exploiting the rules of a system. An ambitious person will likely push the rules as far as they can be pushed without consequences. I.e. i don’t consider an ambitious person skirting taxes legally by exploiting tax laws to be dishonest / not earnest - i view that as a problem with the rules and implementation of the rules than a problem with the individual exploiting them. what i’m talking about is that it’s rare to find a highly ambitious person (e.g. looking to create trillions in value in the world) who lies & cheats their business partners / investors / customers because if they did, they would lose access to valuable resources, or even be jailed. heck, even ambitious criminals and mob bosses are forced to be sufficiently honest and earnest if they want to succeed.
