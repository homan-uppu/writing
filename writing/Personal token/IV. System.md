### Trust

Trust is the foundation for growth. Users in the Network must trust that:
1. the equity they hold in personal tokens will be honored. (i.e the legal, technical implementation is solid).
2. the information they obtain on the Network that they use to make decisions is accurate and aligned with reality.
3. the Network will last. Without the fear that they may wake up one day to see the Network destroyed due to the actions of a stupid individual or authority.
4. the majority of users in the Network are ambitious, long-term oriented individuals with high integrity, not fraudsters looking to run away with the capital they raise without any intention to do what they said they would.

The success of the Network depends on cultivating and protecting such trust, because without sufficient trust investors will not want to participate.

### Tackling fraud

Effectively tackling fraud is required to cultivate trust . By "fraud" I mean misrepresenting reality with the intention to profit.

In the Network, misrepresentation can be in the following ways:
1. Saying you are who you're not.
2. Saying you've accomplished things that you actually haven't.
3. Saying you want to do something with the capital you will raise without actually having the intention to do it.
4. Omitting some (or all) of your ownership of companies outside of the Network.

Each form of misrepresentation has a likely cause. Those who don't identify themselves accurately are likely trying shed the burden of their poor track record, or history of actions that hurt their chances to raise capital. Those who bloat what they've accomplished, or tell ambitious stories of how they'll use capital raised without intending to spend it that way are trying to cheat investors out of money. Those who omit their ownership of companies outside of the Network are likely trying to skip paying the appropriate share of capital gains to their personal token shareholders when they sell equity in companies outside of the Network.

Naturally there are varying degrees to fraud: some misrepresentations are far more harmful than others. It's also possible to make accidents. Intention matters.

The best way to dis-incentivize fraud is to:
1. Ensure users of the Network have high ambition.
2. Effectively tarnish the reputation of bad actors.

### Ambition

Sufficient ambition is a necessary pre-requisite to minimizing fraud because the possibility of a tarnished reputation alone doesn't dis-incentivize an individual from acting fraudulently if they're not ambitious.

Ambitious individuals operate on long-time horizons and understand that a strong reputation is critical for them to achieve their goals. *(note: by reputation I don't mean being liked by others, but rather being seen as an individual who doesn't lie, does what they say they will, honors commitments and generally is a person of strong integrity.)* Therefore, a Network in which all users are genuinely highly ambitious will naturally have far, far less fraud than one with moderate / low ambition users.

How do we ensure that users in the platform are genuinely highly ambitious?

In order to ensure that the Network consists of ambitious, long-term oriented individuals, it's tempting to be selective about who can get into the Network. But, this will backfire because it means the Network will operate at the wrong level of abstraction: instead of being an open platform that facilitates a marketplace of notions about what it means to be "investable" / "ambitious", it operates at the level of a selective sub-Network.

The Network should NOT be selective about who can join the Network beyond the bare minimum such as barring individuals who have been convicted of fraud in the world, as well as meeting any legal / regulatory requirements such as minimum age, etc.

By making the Network itself un-selective, the burden to ensure that users are genuinely ambitious falls on the investors. Investors are incentivized to only invest in the most ambitious individuals (since their greatest returns will come from the most ambitious), and therefore, there's a forcing function to make the entire Network more ambitious in order to be able to raise capital.

Now we need a system to swiftly, accurately tarnish reputations of bad actors. We need a reputation system.

### Reputation

If a user acts fraudulently, their reputation should be negatively impacted.

What would a good reputation system look like?

A good reputation system would have a sufficiently granular measure of reputation, perhaps as a score out of 100, to be able to represent the subtle differences between different kinds of fraud.

A good reputation system swiftly uncovers gaps between what a user claims is true and reality.

A good reputation system would have a rubric that correctly penalizes a misrepresentation proportional to how damaging it is to the health of the Network. For example: raising capital and running with it instead of doing what you said you would when you pitch yourself is an action that could greatly erode trust in the Network. On the other hand, failing to report capital gains from selling equity in a company (out of the Network) is far less damaging. These actions should not be penalized equally.

A good reputation system would interpret the rubric accurately for each case. Any good rubric will have room for interpretation so that it can generalize to many different scenarios. A good reputation system would apply the rubric consistently across cases.

A good reputation system would make a user's reputation score available to all who may want to work with them, to enable users to make more informed decisions.

A good reputation system would have a fair way to challenge decisions that impacted a user's reputation score.

A good reputation system would be sufficiently decentralized to minimize the impact of the biases (which are bound to exist, as well as grow over time) of a single authority.

Implementing such a reputation system is a massive undertaking in and of itself. Fortunately, we'll only need a small subset of features to be able to successfully launch the Network, while leaving the design and implementation of a full-fledged reputation system for later - when the Network is more mature.

At launch, I propose the following system: any user in the Network can flag fraudulent activity, and a centralized reputation authority would assess the claim. If it sees merit in it, the authority would ban the bad actor from the Network.
