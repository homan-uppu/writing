We will optimize for economic growth: to maximize the market capitalization of the Network.

Why? Optimizing for economic growth requires the Network to prioritize the most ambitious individuals. And these are the best kind of individuals to build for because they care about their reputations and are less likely to engage in fraudulent behavior (which will be one of our major challenges).

This is also less of a choice than it seems. In the early days of personal tokens (perhaps the first few decades), I predict we will see competition between different Networks with different design decisions leading to different trade-offs. Yet, network effects are incredibly strong: everyone will want to participate in the Network with the greatest market capitalization because that is where they will have access to the most capital. We will see a winner-takes-all dynamic. In a world in which people can freely choose which Networks to join, people will flock to the Network that is best capitalized that they believe will continue to be in the long-run. The other Networks will fade away.
