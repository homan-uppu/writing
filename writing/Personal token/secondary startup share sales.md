startup secondary sales happen but it's very restricted for the reasons we discussed yest: board wants control over who gets equity in company.
  
but, in some cases after a company has had good growth, the company allows employees to list in secondary exchanges to give employees a way to liquidate their equity. this is becoming more popular bec. employees want ways to cash out a bit without having to wait for a liquidation event (such as an IPO).

i can't find examples of free trading on private company
