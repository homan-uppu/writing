what are the actions that take place in the Network?

**centralized**
- identity verification: ensure a user is who they say they are.
- acceptance: determine who gets into the network.
- off-Network asset verification
- assess fraud complaints & punish bad actors by barring them from participating in the network.
- active rounds feed ordering (can be decentralized).
- feed algorithms:
	- how users discover other users in the Network
	- how users discover active fundraising rounds in the Network

**decentralized**
- vote on fraud authority decisions on fraud complaints (when the decision is challenged) with the power to overturn decisions & an incentive for participating.
- apply to join the network
- raise capital
- invest
- sell equity in personal tokens
- report equity changes in companies (held outside of Network)
- flag fraudulent behavior
- investor updates and direct messaging other users in the Network.
