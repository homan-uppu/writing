----

  

- There are rules / laws that govern every aspect of our universe: from the physical world, to our own minds.
    

- Seeking truth is a recursive search process. (this is the visual to double down on)
    

- Seeking truth is fueled by a want / desire.
    

- There is no creation, only discovery.
    

- Seeking truth is independent thinking.
    

- the conclusions you reach may be the same as everyone else's in some cases, but the process by which you reach them determines your skill.
    

- Any aim other than to seek truth, pollutes truth seeking
    

- Craving for status
    
- Craving to be seen as “original”, or an “independent thinker”
    

- Nature also seeks truth.
    

- Natural selection is a truth seeking process.
    

- All valuable skills can be derived from the skill of seeking truth.
    

- Intuition
    
- Patience
    
- Mental balance
    
- Judgement
    

- Seeking truth is the antithesis of dogma.
    
- The better you are at seeking truth, the less needless suffering you have to go through.
    
- Your skill can be tested in the market.
    
- Most underestimate role of intuition in truth seeking.
    

- 99% of decisions are driven by intuition / subconscious. < 1% are active choices based on
    

- What keeps us from seeking truth well?
    

- Craving / attachment
    
- Not activating the subconscious (which can only be done if it’s a natural expression of the mind, not something that is intellectually forced).
    

- Note: in survival mode, even if it’s not the natural expression, it becomes the natural expression bec. The subconscious is also activated in enabling you to survive.
    

- 4 components of a human
    

- Conditioning
    
- Memory
    
- Ability to act
    
- Willpower
    

- How to seek truth well?
    

- Make seeking truth the sole aim of life.
    
- Design life to enable seeking truth.
    

- People influence us far more than we think. You can only afford to surround yourself with those who want to, and are great at, seeking truth. There can be no exceptions here.
    

- Mental balance. The mind is fundamentally addictive. Dopamine spikes of any kind destabilize the mind and reduces ability to seek truth.
    

- The most important truths to seek are the truths about the self. This is where most of our delusions are. Our delusions about the nature of our selves holds us back from achieving what we want (whatever that may be).
    
- The future self of a truth seeker is unpredictable. At most you can have some probability of what they may do, but you can never know for sure. This means it’s impossible to fully commit to doing something in the future.
    

- E.g. attending events, meetings, etc.
