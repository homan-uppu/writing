I'm already seeing sharp young high schoolers figure out this reality who are working incredibly hard to directly create value in the world through online businesses and startups. I'd bet we'll see a many younger startup / business founders in the coming years.

But, we still have a big problem. Building businesses / startups is one path out of many interesting, valuable paths that an individual can take. What about those that show signs of great potential, but aren't yet ready to start a company, or don't want to. Maybe they're interested in deep tech research (https://x.com/hud_zah/status/1827057785995141558) that will take them a much longer time to get good at compared to learning how to build apps. Or maybe they want to become an economic author. Or maybe they're a budding podcaster who wants to explore their natural curiosities by talking to interesting people (https://meridian.mercury.com/dwarkesh-patel).

Some valuable paths take longer to come to fruition and are less investable in the traditional startup investing sense. Yet, these individuals too will create generational companies, achieve scientific breakthroughs and artistic achievements, though they're not in a position to start a company today and raise money for it. 

As of today, such individuals have two options: rely on family wealth to fund their explorations, or rely on grants (such as the Thiel Fellowship and Emergent ventures). If they don't have access to capital to fund their learning, they're at a severe disadvantage because that means they can only follow their natural curiosities outside of the time they have to spend dealing with the traditional education system.

I see this as a massive problem for two reasons:
1. There will be many talented young people who won't have the bandwidth for training and exploration.
2. because it means that those born into wealth have a much stronger advantage because as the rest of the world is stuck either taking on debt that they will not be able to repay, or waste time in an outdated education system that will not help them in a highly creative world. As the power law distribution of outcomes becomes more pronounced, those without the safety net to explore and train will be severely disadvantaged.

We need a new technology. A new financial instrument that allows individuals to raise money on their future potential, even if they're not in a position to start a company today.

A sharp, young writer, or builder, or scientist, or artist should be able to raise money today in exchange for equity in all (or some) of their future outcomes - which could be in the form of equity in the companies they will start or work for, equity in the public companies they invest in, or even equity in the other people this person will invest in down the line.

Such a financial instrument is far more powerful than relying on grants because it takes advantage of human greed to make a profit, rather than on human compassion /  benevolence. 

Greed scales. Greed is reliable. Greed is anti-fragile towards economic volatility

We would see investors who, say, deeply understand software engineering, or building companies, or quantum mechanics, or content creation invest in people who show early promise in those domains, who have the potential to do incredible work down the line, in exchange for equity in their outcomes.

With such a financial instrument, we would see a new kind of education institution that resembles startup accelerators like YCombinator, except that they train for skills such as design, engineering, science, etc. Instead of charging money up front (which, once again, doesn't work because most likely won't be able to make that money back), they would pay students to come learn from them, in exchange for equity in their future outcomes.

And importantly, access to opportunity isn't restricted only to those who have access to family wealth to finance their creative training which, as we've seen above, has a much more unreliable training path with no clear timeline within which one could be good enough to make a living off of their skill.

We still have a problem: what about those that people don't want to invest in? Maybe they don't show any early signs of promise of being great at something. Maybe they were born with disabilities that make it difficult for them. In a highly creative world dominated by the power law distribution of outcomes, I see no other path than a strong universal basic income system for those left out. But even such a system could be implemented as an investment into individuals in exchange for equity in their outcomes. That way, governments would be incentivized to make sure that more people do well - so that they too can make profits and increase their spending budgets (and probably also to pocket themselves).

These changes will take a while. And in many cases, we will blunder and take steps backwards. For example: governments spending more money on education and subsidizing education won't work because all it does is shift the burden of debt from the individual to the nation. It's still a form of paying for education, just that someone else is paying for it. The fundamental business model is flawed because there is no scalable, reliable way to train for highly creative skills. Yet, I think we're definitely going to make this mistake because it feels like the obvious right thing to do! We're conditioned to want to do this because we're so used to a world in which there was a lot of non-creative work that people could do to make a living. (replace this example / sentence with something better. something that packs a punch).

But, over time, as our work becomes more creative, I can't see any other path than venture capital eating education. While there are concerning possibilities that it may fuel, we have no choice but to minimize the negatives while pushing forward into a world in which those with great potential are supported and amplified.

- As ROI on paying for education plummets and it becomes clear to the world (will take time), less people will pay for education. This will unfortunately take some time given how deeply rooted the habit of paying a lot of money for education has become - due to generational trust in the institution of education.
	- I fear that the societal blunder we will make it to actually spend MORE money on educational institutes, subsidies for people to learn, etc. without realizing that the quality of the institution likely does not impact the outcomes for highly creative skills. In fact, I'm quite sure we'll commit this mistake given just how many people seem to believe this is the solution. It will simply increase tax burden.

- I predict we'll see more startup accelerator types but for other domains.
- **We're missing one key innovation**: the ability to invest in individuals before they have a concrete plan for a company or idea. Without this, people have to wait until they have clarity and ability. And until then, they're stuck in the traditional education system, doing things that likely won't impact their long-term ability.
- Concerns. Naturally such an investment instrument would enable some nasty behaviors such as investors applying pressure on individuals who seem to have lost their way, etc. and we'll need strong measures in place to support young individuals who choose to raise money on their potential.
- Why this is better than relying on grants (e.g. Thiel Fellowship, Emergent ventures).
- What about those that can't raise money? I foresee countries investing in their citizens as well. Perhaps UBI could be issued to everyone as an investment - in exchange for equity in their future outcomes.
