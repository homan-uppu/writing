### Paying to learn no longer works

As our work becomes more creative, great education becomes more rare to find, and where it does exist, will be far more expensive than ever before.

Teaching competence for creative skills also follows a power law distribution proportional to how creative the skill is. 

For example:
Most people can teach basic math well. 
Many can teach high school math well.
Few can teach college level math well.

Only a tiny group can train world class mathematicians well.

  

This is why most business “teachers” fail to train successful entrepreneurs, and why most music teachers fail to train successful musicians. The more creative the skill, the more rare it is to find a good teacher.

  

And since becoming one of the best will be more important than ever before as they capture most of the value, there will be significant demand for the good educators / mentors who can improve your chances of becoming one of the best.

  

A common pushback I hear is that as AI gets better, great education will become cheap and affordable, democratizing learning for all. But, in reality what will happen is that the functions AI can do well will become a commodity and the skill in demand will rise towards what an AI can’t teach you well. Going back to the coding example, when an AI can teach you how to code data structures and algorithms really well, the valuable skill will not be learning that, but rather learning how to leverage the AI that can do that to be able create value in the world. Much more difficult to train far, and even more difficult to teach.

  

Similarly, the internet has given each of access to a treasure trove of knowledge. Those who are determined, and have the time, can become great at many valuable skills through the internet. Yet, as anyone who’s great at something knows, the more knowledge that exists online, the worse the noise to signal ratio becomes: most knowledge is not that great, and often even misleading. As the amount of knowledge grows, a great mentor / teacher who can curate that knowledge well and guide you becomes all the more valuable.

  

As the power law becomes more skewed, and the cost of education rises, paying for education will make little sense for most people because they’ll never earn back their investment in education.

  

Those with access to wealth and resources will have a growing advantage over those that don’t. Those that come from wealth will have access to the premium educators that can train them to be more creative with AI, while the average student will be stuck with educators who are themselves not competent enough to train them for a highly complex, creative skill.

  

This is a huge problem not just because it feels wrong, but also because this is terrible for a nation’s (and the world’s) prosperity. While wealth is concentrated in the hands of few, talent is widely distributed. Therefore, most of the world’s greatest talent does not come from much wealth, if any. A system that does not discover and enable talent regardless of background will be one that allows generations of potential to waste away - including talent that could solve our greatest problems.

  

A common reaction to this problem will be to make education free. Making education free through the government paying public institutions directly, instead of students paying, does not fix inequality of opportunity because public institutions won’t be able to attract the best teaching talent. The best teachers are ones who will be able to command ridiculous compensations on the market (due to the power law). Their compensations will also grow rapidly as AI accelerates. Public institutions won’t be able to keep up with that compensation. This was fine in a less creative world because the earning gap between the average and the best wasn’t that high, and even if the best education gave people a significant leg up, the average one would still enable people to earn a living. But, in a highly creative world average education leads to no results, rather than average results, and so pumping money to prop up average education doesn’t level the playing field.

  

Also, when the government pays public institutions directly, the forcing function to improve education disappears because the institution loses its fear of failing. Once again, this is fine in a world in which the average student with an average education can make a living. This fails in a highly creative world. In fact, it’s even worse for non-wealthy students because it means that many students will learn things that are useless, but won’t know until years down the line when they fail to get a job.

  

We need an education system that doesn’t disadvantage those who don’t come from wealth; one in which someone with talent is given all the resources and mentorship they need in order to do great work.

### Venture capital is the best way to finance learning

[Venture capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital) is a way to fund high-potential projects. Unlike loans that require steady repayment regardless of success, investors invest money in exchange for a share of future value. They know many of their investments will fail, but they bet that the few massive successes will more than make up for the losses. For example, an investor might invest in ten companies knowing that seven might fail completely, two might return their money, but one might become the next Google and generate returns hundreds of times larger than their initial investment.

This model works particularly well for financing things that follow power law distributions - where a small number of winners capture most of the value. Traditional financing, like bank loans, works best when outcomes follow a normal distribution (bell curve) where most borrowers can repay their loans with modest success. But venture capital is designed specifically for situations where outcomes are highly skewed - where most attempts generate little value, but a few generate enormous value. This is why venture capital has been so successful in technology, where a single breakthrough product can capture an entire market.

  
  
  

Venture capital in education could look like the following:

An investor who deeply understands, say, software engineering, can identify young talent with the potential to be great builders. Instead of asking them to pay for an education / for mentorship, they would put capital in their hands to enable them to continue to work on the projects they care about, while offering personalized feedback and guidance. 

In exchange, the investor would take a small cut of the individual’s future assets: such as the companies they create (or join), 

You might say we already have a system like this: grants and scholarships for those who need it. But, there’s a massive difference. 

  
  

But how would this be implemented? Would this require each individual to start their own company (or holding company) in order to raise money?

  

- A reference to ISAs and why they aren’t viable (most value that individuals create will not be in the form of salaries, but rather equity in companies - and other individuals’ outcomes). This is true even today, and will be more true as our work becomes more creative.
