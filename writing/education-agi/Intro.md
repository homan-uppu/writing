We are accelerating towards a world in which our education systems - from colleges to schools - will be unable to generate economic outcomes for students. Most ( > 99%) graduates will be unable to earn back their investments in their educations. Billions of young people are poised to be crippled by debt that they will not be able to repay. We need a better way.

Most discourse around education is focused on "the gap": between what (and how) students learn, and what is required of them to create value in the world. What most don't realize is that we are quickly moving to world in which even the theoretical "best" education (that has no gap) will have, on average, terrible outcomes for its graduates.

Thus, the underlying business model itself: selling education as a product to students who are customers and pay for it up front - is broken because most students, no matter the quality of education, will not be able to earn back their investments.

Of course, bridging the gap is important because it's only when someone has the right learning (not necessarily "formal learning") can they have a shot at realizing their potential.

Fortunately, the solution to the business model problem involves creating a set of incentives that will produce the best quality education as an emergent property of the incentives. 

This essay encapsulates a vision for education in a post-AI world, and how to build it.

But first, we need to thoroughly understand how AI is changing the world because what & how we learn is directly dependent on what the world wants from us - since most people will still want to create value for others (regardless of whether their survival depends on it or not).

Artificial intelligence accelerates the growth of the "gap". Even education in the best universities can't keep up with training students for what the world needs.

Education was designed to produce mediocre outcomes. The world had many opportunities for the average to create economic value, and therefore there was no forcing function to fundamentally change how education operated.

Artificial intelligence fundamentally changes the nature of our economy by making it more *extreme*: the majority of value creation will be concentrated in the hands of few, and the median productivity will fall to 0. This is a trend that has been ongoing for a while, but artificial intelligence will accelerate and amplify how extreme our economy becomes, and how fast it gets there.

While there is no way around some form of wealth redistribution to sustain the many. 

The problem with education isn't just a matter of "teaching the wrong things". Artificial intelligence invalidates the incentive structure of education itself. Selling education as a product that students (customers) pay up front for no longer works in a post-AI world.

While there's no doubt that we will need 

Without a better system, over the coming decade, billions of young people are about to be screwed over. Everyone loses out. 

As much as people may hate to accept, education programs were designed to generate average outcomes. This works in a world in which 

This isn't a matter of "teaching the wrong things", but a matter of the underlying incentive structure of education, its business model, and how artificial intelligence is changing the economy. The current business model of education: selling it as a product that requires students to pay up front - no longer works.

Unfortunately, most people working on education are caught up in trying to answer the question "what to learn in a post AI world?" without realizing that the more important question is: "what set of incentives will generate and preserve the best education".
