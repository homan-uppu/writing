- AI is quickly making entire categories of jobs obsolete. Most college students are learning in ways that are useless in a post-AGI world. Most people recognize that something needs to change, and that most education is rapidly becoming outdated. Most talk about the skills that are worth learning, etc. but what's actually happening is that the entire business model for education is crumbling.
- This essay is my attempt to explore what learning looks like in a post-AGI world.

- no matter how "good" the quality of education is, institutions can no longer charge money to teach. that business model itself is outdated.

- first of all, what is post-AGI? how quickly will we get there?

- it's a systems problem: one of incentives.
- a free market for credentialing.
	- no signal more powerful than an investment.
	- credentials will be through being invested by those with a reputation. give the startup signaling analogy.

- components of education:
	- credentialing. signal your competence to the world. automatically opens many doors.
	- community: forming friendships. creating and learning with others.
	- network: connect with existing peers, alumni, professors, etc.
	- formal learning, grades, projects, exams, etc.

- what is the new business model? what do the next generation of educational institutes look like?
	- startup accelerators

- business model:
	- venture capital.
