- Intro:
	- AI is fundamentally rewriting education at its core: at the level of the business model itself.
- What is education? (a quick look at the *purpose* of education itself).
- How AI changes the world:
	- No room for average.
	- An individual is scaled.
	- Power law distribution & creativity.
	- Differentiation: much greater degree of differentiation required unlike ever before.
		- At the degree that is required for startups to compete.
- Education's business model has been invalidated.
	- Paying to learn no longer works.
	- Early signs.
		- Paradoxical job market: terrible for juniors, excellent for proven talent. Paradox becoming more extreme.
		- ISAs don't make sense in the same way that paying for education doesn't make sense: just shifting who's paying doesn't fundamentally change the business model. This is why it will become harder for any bootcamp to be sustainable unless they're super niche and selling to companies to "upskill" their workforce - which is a tiny sliver of the massive education market.
	- What people are doing instead.
- Components of education:
	- Credentialing
	- Community of peers
	- Network
	- Training
- The future: venture capital driven free market for talent / potential.

things to add / notes:

- when analyzing change it's helpful to see what *won't* change.
	- our craving to create value for others.

- This isn't because AI will surpass human capabilities and leave no room for humans to create economic value. I don't believe AI will outcompete the best humans anytime soon. But, because AI fundamentally changes the nature of our world such that 

- human nature means we will continue to train ourselves no matter how powerful AI becomes:
	- For most people their desires are fundamentally rooted in a desire to contribute to others. The craving to create value for others has been evolutionarily programmed. The external validation, status that stems from such contributions helped keep our ancestors alive because tribes were forced to best protect those that most contributed to the survival of the overall tribe. The hunter who had an acute intuition for how to trap prey that led to more successful hunts was treasured, put on a pedestal, and rightly so.
	- We will not be able to overcome this evolutionary programming just because it's far more difficult to create value in the world. Each human will continue to strive, to do whatever it takes, to be able to contribute. AND: UBI will almost never "feel" enough. If possible, most will still want to take their destinies into their own hands and rise above the baseline - no matter where that baseline is.
