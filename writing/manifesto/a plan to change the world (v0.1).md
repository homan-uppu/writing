### Intro
(an overview of what this entire thing is about, to set the context so that readers have a glimpse of what’s to come, and can even skip to it directly if they wish to).
### Mother Nature?
(a more fundamental understanding of existence).
- what is natural and what is not?
- alignment with nature is 
- if Nature was stubborn about what works against evidence to the contrary, life would have been extinguished. Natural selection itself is proof that Nature is ignorant and is following an approach of experimentation & iteration to understand the truth about what works.
- Nature express itself in society through the individuals that it creates.
### Natural expression
Each individual is Nature's unique experiment in its effort to maximize life in the universe. Each individual is created unique. with a unique temperament, unique inclinations, unique conditioning, and a unique, "natural expression", rooted in their biological code.
- There is no randomness in Nature. There is a complex chain of causes and effects that dictate everything. Our lack of compute to be able to process this massive complexity gives rise to the delusion of randomness. Each genetic mutation, natural selection, evolutionary pressure, etc. are done with the "intention" of getting closer to maximizing life in the universe.

Equality is a delusion. No two individuals are born same. There is no equality anywhere because Nature is not stupid enough to run the same experiment twice.

“Natural expression” of an individual is how they are designed to be, to act. When an individual follows their natural expression, they are more alive, energetic, joyful, and effortlessly obsessive. They live more meaningful, purposeful lives. They feel that they're swimming downstream, not against the current - despite how challenging the task may feel (natural expressions can be difficult).

An individual's natural expression has two components: direction and magnitude. Direction is what they do. Magnitude is how intensely they are naturally wired to go about it. An n-dimensional vector in the space of the possibilities of human expression. 

"n" is un-scalably large that it is impossible for two individuals to have the same natural expression. It impossible for AI to represent the range of human expression (if it can, we will be able to simulate reality itself).
- *expand: make the point that technology cannot replace an individual's natural expression, it can only amplify it. because, if it can replace it, we can simulate reality itself because that is the scale we will need to be able to reach.*
- *similarly: anything AI can do better than humans, that activity is no one's natural expression.*

The way natural expression manifests is a function of both the individual and external factors. Mark Zuck's natural expression if he were to be born 20 years from now could look very different than starting a social networking company. Christopher Nolan, born a century from now, may have a very different manifestation of his natural expression than making 2 - 3.5 hour movies.

All natural expressions fall outside of clearly defined paths that society has set. Existing paths are created by someone else, perhaps according to their natural expression. It's impossible for their paths to be perfectly aligned with your natural expression because each natural expression is unique.

An individual's natural expression is never useless. Throughout history, the greatest contributions have come activities that most considered useless / a waste of time. Each natural expression has a purpose. Nature knows more than we do. We ought to trust Nature's programming (through its genetic mutations, etc. that make each individual unique) than to apply our own limited reasoning as to what's useful and not.
- give the example of an activity that seems absolutely useless right now, with the claim that it will be 
- even in the extreme cases: individuals born with the natural expression to kill others exist with a purpose: to strengthen our measures to stop killing. in a society that makes it impossible to kill others, we will find that there will be no individual with the natural expression to senselessly kill someone else - because that experiment is no longer required. (with the annotation: this is not to say that this ought to be supported. absolutely not. for each individual like this, there will be many with the natural expression to dedicate their lives to preventing such atrocities.)

The best society is one that gets out of Nature's way, by allowing it to run its experiments through us, which happens by enabling each individual to discover and express themselves according to their natural expression. Such a society is the most robust: best able to tackle its challenges. 

Such a society may seem wasteful, but it's the opposite. The society that will produce the solution for global warming will also be the one that supports the "useless" individual who naturally obsesses about mushroom foraging. You can't have one without the other. A society that censors the useless will also censor the useful.
- *this may need to go in "oppression"?*

When each individual has the freedom and resources to do what they're meant to do - to follow their natural expression - we do the best we possibly can. There is nothing more we can hope for.
### Oppression
Oppression is any force that pushes an individual away from their natural expression: both in direction and magnitude. Oppression holds us back individually, and collectively. It's an act against Nature.

Oppression can be external: authorities controlling what an individual can and cannot do, environment (lack of resources to carry out your natural expression), collectivist cultures that don’t give the individual the space to find their natural expression, dogmatic religions, etc.
- Natural expression is incredibly delicate. An individual also needs sufficient health to be able to express naturally. Therefore, even health hazards are oppressive - pollution is oppressive.

Oppression can be internal: our own fears of failure, over-competitiveness, coping mechanisms (such as deluding ourselves into thinking we’ve found our natural expression when we actually haven’t), addictions, laziness, etc. For many of us, the subtle voice inside of us that guides us towards our natural expressions is incredibly weak. Oppressed, overpowered by ourselves.
- *i need to explain the war within. "natural expression" is not the only thing that exists in an individual's mind. our conditioning: both evolutionary, and in our lives, can overpower our natural expression.*
- Therefore, natural expression is a continuous process. There is no guarantee that someone who has found their natural expression in one moment will be able to retain it in the next. It's a constant effort, struggle, to protect your natural expression from the various feelings and conditionings that pull you away from it: attachment to a particular identity, craving for external validation & recognition, jealousy, over-competitiveness, etc. These feelings can come and go. Oftentimes, we feel these things without even realizing. This inner battle is more challenging than it may seem at first glance.
- Natural expression is incredibly delicate.

Most of the world is significantly oppressed: spending most of their time doing things they aren’t naturally inclined to want to do, desperately seeking joy, and accepting that this is all there is to life.

Oppression leads to people who live life by just going through the motions, depressed, frustrated, purposeless.
- *there's something beautifully poetic you can add here.*

**In the broadest sense, our mission is to eliminate oppression.**

### Eliminating oppression
There are 6 ways to combat external oppression: ==Technology==, ==Free markets==, ==Human rights==, ==Economic growth==, ==Artistry==, ==Culture==.

#### Technology
Technology is any new or better way of doing things. Technology makes individuals more powerful through leverage: their ability to influence things.

A poor person today is far more powerful than the richest king from the middle ages. A poor person still has access to the world's knowledge, powerful AI systems to learn from, and medicine that our ancestors couldn't even dream of. A poor person today has an opportunity to share a message with the rest of the world in an instant.

The more leverage an individual has, the more ways in which they can express themselves. 
- this is actually a huge point: our natural expressions are often across many different kinds of expression, and rarely constrained to one particular way of something. Technology increases the range of expression, and therefore, allows greater room for our natural expressions to shine.
- Technology also democratizes such means of expression. Only a handful of filmmakers could exist a century ago even though many orders of magnitude more were naturally gifted in filmmaking, but could not express themselves that way due to the economic cost of such expression. This is also a form of external oppression of their natural expression.
- A visually creative girl in 500 BC could probably only draw paintings and share with a handful of people in his village. The same girl today has many more avenues for her natural expression to shine: by making videos with her smartphone with the help of AI, and the ability to share to a large audience and iterate with their feedback.

#### Free markets
- a free market is an act of humility: to say that we don't know, but we will get further towards the truth by enabling more experiments and doubling down on the ones that work. this is precisely how Nature operates: run experiments and allow natural selection to double down on the ones that work, and then continue to experiment on top of that. (in fact, Nature continues to experiment *before* that success as well - in case it has reached a local maxima instead of a global one. there will be many other evolutions that surpass human beings intellect that take very different evolutionary paths than the one that we took to get here).
- free markets best adapt to change. it's dynamic. rich with various viewpoints and opinions.
- **free markets give space for truths to arise, and safeguard them.**
	- the more rapidly the world changes, the more quickly truths become outdated.
	- a free market becomes the best approximation towards the truth about most external things (this clarification is required because internal truths are a different ballgame altogether).
	- double down / expand this relationship between the truth and free markets. it's an important relationship, that's actually at the crux of my worldview.

#### Economic growth
Free markets go hand in hand with economic growth.
Economic growth fuels more experiments in the free market.
Without economic growth, a free market stagnates: outcomes are dictated by a few...
- give the example of a free market for ideas. With only 1000 investors, only a few ideas would get funded - likely the most obvious ones. With 10^100 investors each capable of investing in an idea, many more ideas, even the unpopular, unobvious ones, will get funded. Therefore, more natural expression is enabled - including the kinds that aren't obviously useful.
- Technology also plays a part here: by reducing the capital required to implement an idea. Technology also increases the number of investors in the market by reducing the minimum investment amount to fund an idea.
- Compare the marketplace of ideas today to what it was 30 years ago.
- Economic growth also enables greater risk appetite - which also expands the number of ideas that are funded.
- Yet, even today, the free market is far, far from where it could be. Most ideas that ought to be funded are not. Most natural expressions are still oppressed.

Free markets fuel economic growth, and economic growth fuels free markets.
- e.g. even the most centralized economies had to adopt more free markets in order to optimize for economic growth.

The more leveraged people are, the more free the market must become in order to optimize for economic growth.
- in a world without computers, internet, etc. that is driven by manufacturing, you could get away with a more centralized approach to economic growth: which is precisely what China did. But, the more leverage an individual has, the more you hold back economic growth by oppressing natural expression.

#### Human rights
Human rights:
- Slavery wasn't abolished because we somehow grew a moral conscience, but because the market forces could no longer bear oppressing individuals who would otherwise be able to contribute greatly towards economic growth.
	- Put another way: if it were true that, say, Indians were in fact an inferior race compared to white Britishers, and could not innovate / contribute economically on par with the white people, colonial rule would likely still exist: ruling Indians, and I wouldn't be writing this because my family would have never made it to the US, because market forces wouldn't have cared as much about our human rights if we wouldn't have been able to positively impact the economy.
	- Our morality is inextricably linked to economic growth. The more economically advanced a nation becomes, the more they care about human rights and protecting individual freedom.
	- An economically stagnant nation will struggle to have strong human rights. They way they discriminate may change, they may latch onto new identities to discriminate, etc., but human rights for all won't be found.
- Reality is of course messy, and oftentimes you need a generation who was conditioned to be prejudiced by a less economically well off society to die before their prejudices leave. But, by and large, economic growth is the most powerful force to establish (and continuously raise the bar of) human rights.
- Morality is tightly coupled with economic growth:
	- The average Indian doesn't give a shit about a problem in another country in the way that the average American does because they need greater economic growth to push the bounds of what they care about.
#### Artistry
- Artistry is a kind of expression that is beyond logic, reason. You cannot logically reason to creating an incredible film, or to creating a product that changes the world - because such ideas are often shunned by the market that aims for efficiency.
- Artistry is to rise above the optimizing nature of the market, to rise above "making what the algorithm wants", to be driven by a feeling that this must exist rather than an MBA style analysis of why it ought to exist.
- It's precisely the kind of individual that hates the System, that hates the status quo, who is crazy enough to create something that most of the market thinks is useless, the one that supports the growth of the market.
- Such individuals create a market where it doesn't yet exist, for the cycle to repeat itself.
- Free markets would stagnate without artistry. It's the artists who keep the markets and economic growth moving forward by doing things that any "sane" player wouldn't do.
- **Natural expression is artistry**.
- something v. v. important to discuss: artistry at the individual level doesn't imply their process is necessarily experimentative / iterative. free markets at the collective level, artistry at the individual level. this is the paradox. the individual artistry oftentimes just comes from a feeling of wanting to do something. this paradox / contradiction is important to point out.

#### Culture
Cultures that don't support experimentation, tinkering, and taking risks, that stigmatize failure, are incredibly oppressive.

Such cultures deeply condition minds by strengthening our internal enemies that prevent our natural expressions from manifesting. Such cultures arm the wrong side in our inner wars.

- Cultures that reinforce affirmative action, and reparations, actually reinforce the very prejudices they aim to tackle. A child that is constantly told that they are not on an equal footing as children from another community (whether true or not), is less likely to follow their natural expression because they aren't as confident in themselves because they believe they will be outcompeted as others have an inherent upper hand. On the other hand, cultures that instill a deep confidence that you can do what you set your mind to maximizes individuals following their natural expression. Both are of course not true & the truth exists somewhere in between both extremes. But, culture is often formed around extreme stances, and hence pegging it on the delusion that anyone can do what they set their minds to is more truthful than the other.
- something about how certain cultures kill artistry by being too risk-averse.
- culture needs to also be truth seeking: why is this important? what does truth seeking have to do with oppression? they are clearly closely linked in my mind, but i need to do a much better job of explaining / articulating that connection.
#### Inter-connectedness
Each of these factors to fight external oppression go hand in hand. Each influences the rest. They are of the same essence: like different sides of the same cube; different ways of looking at the same phenomenon.

Any endeavor that creates better / more technology, free markets, economic growth, artistry, and the right culture, fights oppression.

Similarly, any endeavor that pushes against these factors are oppressive:
- Centralized education
- Over-regulation
- Ideologies that want to curb economic growth.
- ...
#### Internal oppression is an individual battle
Fighting internal oppression is an individual struggle. None of us can fight the internal battle for another. The best we can hope for is to eliminate external oppression so that an individual's ability to discover and express their natural expression is entirely their responsibility.

- As you can see, external and internal oppression are tightly connected. External oppression often leads to inner oppression, and vice versa.

Which is why people who believe that the future will somehow be a happy and joyful place for all humans are quite deluded. The war shifts from external to internal, but the war against oppression will always continue. The change is that the only person an individual will have to blame for their downfall will be themselves. And that is a future absolutely worth striving for.

#### Optimality
*(not sure how important this is. i mean, it's definitely part of my world view, but... actually, don't debate this right now. focus on writing it all out and can then sit and debate this point).*
E.g.
- Strong human rights without sufficiently sized economy can't be enforced / honored.

Right now we're rapidly accelerating from optimality because technology is rapidly accelerating much faster than anything else can keep up.
- this creates a sort of imbalance.
- imbalance is oppressive.
- the only way is to accelerate the evolution of the other factors to catch up, not necessarily slow down AI - because the benefits outweigh the downsides (because better technology democratizes access to incredibly valuable resources, and accelerates the change that eliminates oppression).

#### Where to start?
The fight against oppression is a battle on many fronts: from technological, economical, cultural, political, legal, and otherwise. Similar to how each individual must fight inner oppression that holds that person back from their natural expression, collectively we must fight the external oppressions that holds us back from our collective natural expression, that holds us back from doing what Nature wishes we did.

Where does our fight begin? We cannot fight on all fronts from day 0. Firstly, I want to be clear, I'm talking about this from the perspective of this organization and how WE will fight oppression. This is no means a directive for what others should do. People should follow their natural expressions (if they can), and do whatever feels right to them.

I believe that the greatest catalyst to fight oppression is building AGI. I hope everyone who's natural expressions lend themselves well to build AGI go do that.

AI is rapidly changing the way the world works. But, without a new economic model designed for the intelligence age, AI will likely be oppressive. I'll now share my predictions for how AI will shape the world, and use its consequences to illustrate how we must change our economic system to ensure that AI fights oppression rather than oppress.

### How AI changes the world
- each individual very powerful.
- no room for two individuals doing the same thing - therefore, a powerful forcing function to find natural expression - that is the only way someone can hope to contribute to the collective.
- this is unlike any jump we've witnessed in human history. it's NOT the same as the manufacturing revolution, etc.
- the power law distribution.
- AI will not replace the range of human expression. There will always be room for human contribution. AI will replace work that humans shouldn't be doing (that our descendants will clearly see is beneath us - even though it may feel harsh to the many who've spent their lives on work that AI will be able to do better than them).
	- use the "complexity" of the n-dimensional expression vector to make this point.
- but, without the right economic system, AI will be oppressive.
- AI is the greatest opportunity we have ever had to tackle oppression & nurture natural expression.
### The idea

#### Second order effects
- Most incorrectly believe that fixing education is a curriculum problem. It's actually a business model problem. Personal tokens enable the best education system to emerge - from a rich marketplace of options.
### Join the team
- designing the right organization is critically important to our success.
- incentives:
	- the 4 year vesting with a 1 year cliff standard is laughably unambitious. it leads to checked out leadership and / or employees after a couple of decades (tops). organizations that stand the test of time must have a more ambitious incentive / compensation structure. we will need to figure out what this is.
- there will be no distinctions between types of creation except for: ambitious and non-ambitious.
- San Francisco will become the HQ for artistry across all human activities. We will need to be here.
- the best teams work in person.
- the world will not be able to label this team, this organization, this effort. are we a company, an investment fund, a film production studio, a political party? a new kind of organization that will be difficult to label and categorize. a fintech? web3? social network? AI?
1. DM me if you want to, are capable of building this future. you must be insanely talented, completely committed, sufficiently aligned (not necessarily on the details, but you must similarly believe that this is the most important mission to work on). we will do whatever it takes to eliminate oppression of the human spirit. there is no notion of "balance". you're either all in, or you're out. there is no room for any lack of commitment or mediocrity. this is a co-founder level position. we aren't yet building out an entire team... there is room for at most 3 people (including myself) to get this off the ground.
- if this work isn't aligned with your natural expression, and if your natural expression isn't intense, you won't last.
- if my predictions about the rate at which AI evolves is accurate, then we will not need more than 10 members for the foreseeable future to be able to effectively carry out our mission. (of course, this is a prediction, if reality is different we will hire more / less people. the mission comes first).
- i am willing to wait as long as possible to bring on board the right people. in the past, mediocrity would weigh a team down. In the age of intelligence, mediocrity kills teams. there is absolutely no room for mediocrity.
- it might seem premature to describe all the ways in which we can work towards fighting oppression, instead of just describing our starting point. i'm sharing all of this to show you that our range of expression has no bounds: we will eventually operate on all fronts: technological, political, cultural, and on fronts that may not even exist yet. Gone are the days of "staying in your lane". AI increases the size of each lane. Our activities will be much larger than our starting point, while also knowing that for the foreseeable future, we will be focused on the starting point alone: the market for expressions.
### Invest
1. if you think this idea deserves more attention: repost.
2. if you believe in this idea and want to support it, invest in [my personal token](https://personaltoken.vc).
	1. position this as investing in my natural expression. and then define what my natural expression is (and how it's hard for me to predict everything that i do), and why investing in my personal token is more directly investing in this mission, which may reach much further than just personal tokens - it is an investment in every single way in which i express myself for this mission.
	2. (and actually link to personaltoken.vc/homan - show the damn product) + i will only accept investments after meeting in person (a bit old schooled this way). Raise $10m - aim fucking bigger. Done.
### notes
- I really like the "marketplace for human expressions" - it really ties into the theme of this manifesto.
- I'm convinced about sharing this manifesto and becoming a man in the arena instead of commenting from the sidelines.
- This manifesto and approach also lends itself well to a very confident outreach: I'm reaching out because I believe you have great potential and I'm interested in working with you on an idea to change the world: (+ link to this manifesto). Take as much time as required to get this manifesto right. This is your golden ticket.
