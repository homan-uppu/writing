We're at an inflection in the history of our species. Rapid advancement in artificial intelligence has the power to fundamentally push our species forward to enable us to tackle our greatest collective challenges, to rise above our existential threats, ushering us into an age of abundance and prosperity.

Yet, the rest of our systems: economic, political, cultural are severely lagging behind. If we don't rapidly evolve society itself, AI will become a force of oppression rather than a tool for advancement. In our world, there is no stagnation: only accelerating ascension or descension. **We must ascend**.

This document is my vision for the society that we must work together to create and how we're going to go about it. 

While having the right ideas are important, executing them is even more important: it is how we actually bring about change, and it is how we adapt our ideas to reality. Therefore, I view this document more as a rough guide for our starting point and the direction we must head in with the understanding that the details of how we go about it are subject to change based on what we learn from reality - through our execution.

It's divided into 3 parts:
1. The mission: what we must strive for, and why.
2. The idea: what we need to create now (the starting point).
3. Execution: how we're going to do this.
