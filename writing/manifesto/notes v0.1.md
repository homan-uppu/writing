natural expression
- each individual is Nature's unique experiment in its effort to maximize life in the universe.
- each individual is created unique. with a unique temperament, unique inclinations, unique conditioning, and a unique, natural, expression, rooted in a unique, complex, biological code. equality is a delusion.
- when an individual follows their natural expression, they are more alive, joyful, and energetic. they live better lives for themselves, and they contribute more to the collective wellbeing.
- natural expression has two components: direction and magnitude.
- the way natural expression manifests is a function of the individual and environment.
	- e.g. Mark Zuck's natural expression if he were to be born 20 years from now could look very different than starting a social networking company. Same with Christopher Nolan, etc.
- an individual's natural expression is never useless. throughout history, the greatest contributions often stem from activities that most considered useless / a waste of time.
	- No matter how useless it may seem, it contributes to a great outcome in some way or the other.
	- Each natural expression has a purpose. Therefore, each individual has a purpose.
- Nature knows more than we do. We ought to trust Nature's programming (through its genetic mutations, etc. that make each individual unique) than to apply our own limited reasoning as to what's useful and not.
- the best version of society is one in which each individual has the space to find their natural expression and the resources to double down on it. by definition, if each of us were to find this, humanity would do the best it can to tackle all of our problems. if we can do this, we can ask no more from humanity because we are literally doing the best we can.
	- Everyone wins when an individual finds and doubles down on their natural expression.

oppression
- our greatest problem is oppression: deviation of an individual from their natural expression.
- oppression has degree and magnitude:
	- degree: angle of difference between natural expression and current expression.
	- magnitude: intensity of expression (how hard they double down on their expression).
- magnitude oppression is relative to the environment. e.g. someone who starts a shoe company because they love shoes in 1960's India may not be oppressed magnitudinally because it was incredibly ambitious to start any thing then. but the same person if they had started the same kind of company in 2024, they would be be oppressed magnitudinally because 
	- similarly: a caveman who wants to create great art for every person he knows (which is likely not more than 1000), in 2024, should want to deliver their art to every single person in the world to not oppress their natural expression.
	- this means tackling oppression is a continuous action, not a one-and-done thing.
- natural expression is a function of both the individual and the environment.
	- Mark Zuckerberg if born 20 years from now would not start something that looks like Facebook. Nolan if born 20 years from now would likely not tell the story of Batman (this is assuming they are following their natural expressions).
	- therefore change is also oppressive.
- telling someone they are disadvantaged is oppressive because that individual is less likely to believe they can succeed, and therefore is less likely to try and thus deviates from their natural expression.
	- i.e. white guilt is oppressive both to those who feel the guilt and to those who are reinforced that they are disadvantaged.
	- anti-oppressive delusions: firm self-belief.
- oppression is an act against Nature. a grave sin.
- two forms of oppression: external & internal.
- internal oppression:
	- allowing fear of failure to deter.
	- over-competitiveness.
	- delusion that stems from coping mechanisms (no one wants to admit that they haven't found their purpose, though it is likely true).
- my singular purpose is to eliminate the oppression of the individual.

the solution:
- external and internal oppression have somewhat different approaches.

eliminating external oppression:
- **economic growth**. growth is worshipping Nature.
- **free markets are temples: places of worship.**
	- the more capital in the free market, the less oppression.
	- to increase the capital in the free market, we need economic growth.

- AGI that will make great discoveries independent of humans will not arrive anytime soon. for the foreseeable future, great work will be human driven, with AI amplifying and executing powerful human visions.

- but, even with no authorities dictating what an individual does, the individual is not free. finding natural expression means overcome the craving to be accepted and liked by others. 
- the war shifts from external to internal. but, the war persists.

- economic incentives and culture go hand in hand.
- it's only after we had ways to organize large groups of people and the ability to traverse to far places that religions were invented to push people to conquer other places. in other words: the economic gains from conquest crafted a religion & culture that pushed for conquest.
- 

designing the right organization is critically important to our success.
- incentives:
	- the 4 year vesting with a 1 year cliff standard is laughably unambitious. it leads to checked out leadership and / or employees after a couple of decades (tops). organizations that stand the test of time must have a more ambitious incentive / compensation structure. we will need to figure out what this is.
- there will be no distinctions between types of creation except for: ambitious and non-ambitious.
- San Francisco will be the seat of global ambition - across any and all endeavors.
- the best teams work in person.
- the world will not be able to label this team, this organization, this effort. are we a company, an investment fund, a film production studio, a political party? a new kind of organization that will be difficult to label and categorize. a fintech? web3? social network? AI?

CTA:
1. DM me if you're interested in working together. you must be insanely talented, completely committed, sufficiently aligned (not necessarily on the details, but you must similarly believe that this is the most important mission to work on). we will do whatever it takes to eliminate oppression of the human spirit. there is no notion of "balance". you're either all in, or you're out. there is no room for any lack of commitment or mediocrity. this is a co-founder level position. we aren't yet building out an entire team... there is room for at most 3 people (including myself) to get this off the ground.
		2. if you think this idea is interesting and deserves more attention: repost.
		3. if you believe in this idea and want to support it, invest in my personal token.
			1. which means you need: personaltoken.vc/homan/1 already setup - i.e. the link to the first fundraising round.
