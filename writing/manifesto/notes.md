### confidence.
present this idea with immense confidence. you can be humble and confident simultaneously. they can go hand in hand.

when you present crazy ideas, your level of confidence in it significantly influences others tendency to believe in the idea. you can't afford to put forth novel ideas in a meek, timid way... no one will give a shit about it.

### on "launch" strategy
1. just cryptically send this to a few people w/ the subject "a plan to change the world. work together?" - or something similarly audacious. it must be incredibly simple, almost too idealistic / naive - which attracts ambition (e.g. something that would make you open it right away.)
	1. created a pinned post: "a plan to change the world: " + a summary (likely just the intro paragraph).
	2. have a clear CTA:
		1. DM me if you're interested in working together. you must be insanely talented, completely committed, sufficiently aligned (not necessarily on the details, but you must similarly believe that this is the most important mission to work on). we will do whatever it takes to eliminate oppression of the human spirit. there is no notion of "balance". you're either all in, or you're out. there is no room for any lack of commitment or mediocrity. this is a co-founder level position. we aren't yet building out an entire team... there is room for at most 3 people (including myself) to get this off the ground.
		2. if you think this idea is interesting and deserves more attention: repost.
		3. if you believe in this idea and want to support it, invest in my personal token.
			1. which means you need: personaltoken.vc/homan/1 already setup - i.e. the link to the first fundraising round.
2. **make the film**. a film that tickles the feels. i want to inspire and motivate people for this mission and to show them exactly what the path looks like.
	1. guard the production of this film. create some early cuts yourself.
	2. keep the budget exceptionally low. lean into the "rawness". use your creativity and ingenuity to make something amazing on a shoestring budget.
3. before you feel "ready", **move to SF** and socialize the shit out of this idea - to the right people. get the right people on board.
### on the film
- don't present the full idea even to the technicians you work with. give them a higher level abstract that they can work with (with reference samples to work with). only you should have the end-to-end picture / vision.
	- why are you thinking of this approach?
	- i believe the best work comes from a singular creative vision, unpolluted by over-collaboration. even when there seems to be collaboration, the greatest works are still driven by a single person.
	- guard even the first cut of the video (if you choose to make a video that is - which i think you should. it's an important form of expression, one that is required to infiltrate the subconscious. there is no other way.).
### eliminate oppression vs. democratize opportunity.
- focusing on eliminating oppression as the goal is far better than saying we need to democratize opportunity. the former gives you an enemy to fight, which riles up the emotion far more than something as complex as "democratize opportunity". so, i really like this shift. lean into it.\
### find the courage
- say what you think without worrying about repercussions.
- be fucking bold. put yourself out there. follow and trust your instinct.
### simple, minimal, presentation
- IT'S GOING TO BE A GOOGLE DOC! allow people to leave comments. ship it to the world in this raw, simple, format. done. let the world create a better representation of it later. focus purely on the idea / philosophy.
- you need a name for this organization. publish this on that domain.
- keep the presentation exceptionally simple, or go hard. but nothing in between. i lean towards simple:
	- https://rostra.co/
	- https://ssi.inc/
	- https://thinkingmachines.ai/
	- https://ia.samaltman.com/
	- https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai/
- the simpler your presentation, the more confident you come across. similar to how a billionaire can walk into a fancy restaurants in shorts and a white tee: they don't have to dress up to exude incredible confidence and it's almost like a fuck you to the establishment that "wants" everyone to dress up (and in the case of startups: to have a fancy af landing page with a bunch of animations and 3D graphics, etc. lol).
- you could even do a fucking PDF file, or a Google doc. actually a Google doc is probably solid. that's the extreme version LOL.
### be hyper aggressive to get to the first draft.
while there is no deadline to publish, you must push yourself harder to get to the first draft - which is when the actual work begins.
