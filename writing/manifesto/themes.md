- We are Nature's experiments.
- the goal: eliminate oppression. define oppression clearly, succinctly.
- spectrum of oppression: external -> internal.
	- show what these look like at both ends of the spectrum and in between as well.
- ways to detect oppression:
	- any semblance of equal outcomes (the middle class). any step function in outcomes signals oppression.
	- any group of individuals doing similar kinds of work signals oppression.
	- collectivism is oppressive.
- on AI:
	- makes each individual more powerful than ever before.
